Most over-70s are likely to be given boosters in their local GP surgery, while those aged between 60 and 70 are likely to get them in mass vaccination centres. Officials are currently working on the details of the rollout of the boosters, which was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday. Officials say that with two million doses of the Pfizer vaccine in stock, supply in not an issue.However, some people in this age cohort will have to wait for the vaccine, as six months will have to have elapsed since they received their second, regular dose of Covid-19 vaccine.Up until now, boosters have been provided to three groups only: over-80s, people in residential care aged over 65 and those who may be immunocompromised. So far, more than 100,000 boosters have been administered.The HSE says it plans to complete the administration of boosters to residents of nursing home and other residential centres by the end of next week.It says it will take about 10 days for the latest Government decision on boosters to be operationalised. More than 182,000 people are aged 80 and over, and 345,000 are in the 70-79 age group. A further 479,000 people are aged between 60 and 69.Healthcare workersNo decision has been reached yet by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) on a booster jab for healthcare workers. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said on Tuesday that the issue is being kept under review by Niac but the Government considers it an urgent matter. There is significant impatience among some Ministers and senior officials at the pace of Niac’s work.Mr Martin told the Dáil that he would like to see healthcare workers receiving boosters, but that we must take “expert advice of Niac”.The Taoiseach was speaking after the announcement on Tuesday that the next phase of reopening would go ahead but with some restrictions maintained into the new year as concerns grow over the rising number of Covid-19 cases. There were 2,399 new cases reported by the Department of Health on Tuesday, the highest daily total since January.Reopening planUnder the revised reopening plan, normal trading hours in pubs, restaurants and wider hospitality will resume, and nightclubs are set to reopen from Friday for the first time since the start of the pandemic, though with some restrictions still in place.Indoor and outdoor events will be permitted to take place without any restrictions on capacity. Religious services and weddings will proceed on a similar footing, while the return to workplaces will continue on a “phased and cautious” basis.New rules will be developed for the operation of nightclubs which are likely to “involve Covid-19 passes, contact-tracing data collection and wearing of face masks except when eating, drinking and dancing”, the Government said in a statement.Amid some confusion about how nightclubs would operate, Mr Martin said last night the Government would engage with the hospitality industry on Wednesday. Questioned by journalists at a press conference in Government Buildings following Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, Mr Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar accepted that there would be anomalies and contradictions in the weeks ahead, with different rules for different hospitality sectors.Mr Varadkar also said the National Public Health Emergency Team had warned the Government that the recent surge in cases would not peak until the end of this month, while hospitalisations and ICU admissions would peak later in November or early December.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"call goes out for older women to safeguard bone health","story":"On World Osteoporosis Day, which is Wednesday, the Irish Osteoporosis Society is urging women over 65 to protect their bone health. Pictured are society ambassador TV presenter Mary Kennedy, Hilda Smith, Mary Dunne and Anne Marsh. Older women have been urged to protect their bone health with data showing almost 70 per cent of hip fractures occur in women.A low level of awareness of the role played by osteoporosis in such injuries has also emerged, with a survey of GPs finding that a vast majority of women found to have the condition after suffering a fracture are surprised by the diagnosis.More than half of women at an increased risk of a fracture through their bone fragility remain untreated for osteoporosis, thereby leaving them at increased risk, the research found.The data was collected by the Irish Osteoporosis Society to mark World Osteoporosis Day. It points out that fractures in vulnerable people can occur from “something as simple as a sneeze or bending over to tie a shoelace”.Health Service Executive figures show that almost 4,000 people were hospitalised for osteoporosis-related hip fractures in Ireland in 2019, of which 69 per cent were women.With Ireland having the sixth highest rate of hip fragility fractures (breaks) globally, the society says the treatment gap for the disease is widening across the country.Prof Moira O’Brien, founder of the society, described the rate of diagnosis as “shocking” given most fractures can be prevented and the disease treated. “Early diagnosis of this silent disease is extremely important to help people, particularly women, avoid potentially life changing injuries,” she said.Scans and resourcesGPs need better access to DXA scans and other resources, which are often only available privately, she said. “We know recovery from bone fractures can be very difficult, so we are asking people to become aware of their bone health and speak to their GP or contact.”Risk factors for osteoporosis include being a woman over 65, having a history of osteoporosis in your family and having a history of broken bones. Other, controllable risk factors include being a smoker, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and having a low body weight.Of the doctors surveyed by GP Buddy, 54 per cent said a lack of resources was negatively affecting the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Some 69 per cent of GPs said they offer advice to at-risk patients on how to avoid fractures while 100 per cent believed patient knowledge needed to be improved.Meanwhile, in the UK, a new study by the Royal Osteoporosis Society has found that almost one-fifth of people with the disease have had to retire or cut back work hours while a quarter live with long-term pain.The disease affects people in lower-income households more severely, leaving them more likely to live with long-term pain, to feel more socially isolated and to have their work affected, the study found.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"full return to offices delayed until next spring says varadkar","story":"The full return to offices is being delayed until next spring in response to rising Covid-19 casesThe full return to offices is being delayed until next spring in response to rising Covid-19 cases, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.Setting out changes to the Government’s planned lifting of pandemic restrictions, Mr Varadkar said “a staggered and phased return to the office” was still possible but a full return to offices – “as we knew them”– would not happen until the spring of 2022.Under the previous reopening plan announced at the end of August, the Government planned to remove the requirement to work from home from October 22nd permitting workers to return to workplaces where they had worked from home on a phased and cautious basis.The National Public Health Emergency Team advised the Government that the return to the workplace should continue on a “phased and cautious basis” but recommended that “all who can work from home should continue to do so”.“A staggered and phased return to the office is possible so people going back to the office for a specific business purpose like a meeting or training, for example, or inductions, that is allowed,” said Mr Varadkar.“Certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that.’The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said there had been people “working from home with a laptop on a bed for 18 months now” and that they really wanted to return to the office.“If that can be facilitated, if they can be in an office on their own or in an office where they are socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the Government would be meeting trade unions and employer groups on Tuesday to update work safety protocols over the coming days.Neil McDonnell, chief executive of small and mid-sized business group, ISME, said that most businesses were not planning a full return to the office until next spring. “We are still on the trajectory to reopen, as already set, albeit cautiously and in a blended fashion rather than a full reopening,” he said. “There are very few employers who were planning a full return to the office.”He said that the types of businesses that have raised concerns about the pace to a full return included those in engineering, architecture and IT involved in team working.“That stuff is very hard to execute from home but it is still possible,” said Mr McDonnell.Danny McCoy, chief executive of business group Ibec, said businesses must continue to receive “necessary financial supports to ensure that they remain viable” as some restrictions remain.Many sectors will continue to face “difficult trading challenges in the weeks and months ahead,” he said.Sven Spollen Behrens, director of the Small Firms Association, said that it was “not appropriate” to taper off State fiscal supports in light of the delayed reopening.Many businesses had developed extensive plans to open fully over the October Bank Holiday weekend with money paid to suppliers and staff rostered, he said.“Return to offices on a staggered basis is well advanced and must continue in line with previously laid out criteria,” he said.Irish Congress of Trade Unions general secretary Patricia King said the Government’s message to employers needed to clearly state that physical attendance in the workplace “must continue to be on a phased and cautious basis for specific business requirements.”“Working from home has not resulted in reduced productivity for employers,” she said. “Continuing with the staggered and phased return to the office is the right decision given the current levels of transmission and hospitalisation, and the strain our healthcare workforce is under after 20 months of incessant demand on them.” Nphet cautioned in its letter to Government that public health restrictions may have to be reintroduced if the newly recommended measures did not suppress the spread of the virus. It stressed the importance of employers encouraging workers to self-isolate if they are showing symptoms of Covid-19 and said employees should not be disincentivised by employers if they identify themselves as symptomatic and have to stay at home.Home-working had played “a very important role” in containing the spread of Covid-19 throughout the pandemic, Nphet said.It said there were 19 workplace Covid-19 outbreaks reported in the latest weekly figures, including five in food or meat production facilities and four in the construction sector.

Video: RTEA revised reopening plan has been unveiled by Ministers which will see the easing of further restrictions on the night-time economy coupled with the retention of public health measures until at least February 2022.Under the plan, normal trading hours in pubs, restaurants and wider hospitality will resume, and nightclubs are set to reopen from Friday – albeit it with restrictions – for the first time since the start of the pandemic.New rules will be developed for the operation of nightclubs which are likely to “involve Covid-19 passes, contact tracing data collection and wearing of face masks except when eating, drinking and dancing”, the Government said in a statement.Religious services and weddings will now be allowed to proceed without any limits on capacity, while the return to workplaces will continue on a “phased and cautious” basis.Speaking to reporters after the plan was announced Tánaiste Leo Varadkar admitted the country was not where it hoped to be with regards to coronavirus infections.He said two or three weeks ago the trajectory of Covid cases had taken a turn for the worse with rising case numbers, hospitalisations and intensive care (ICU) numbers.Mr Varadkar also warned the country was not past the peak of this Delta wave: “Indeed, we are most likely experiencing a twin peak.”Mr Varadkar said: “The pandemic isn’t over yet. We’re going to have get through at least another winter before we can say it’s behind us.”He told reporters at a post-Cabinet briefing: “We’re not where we hoped to be or expected to be for October 22nd.” He said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) expected Covid-19 cases to peak at the end of October, with ICU numbers peaking at about 150 by the end of November.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said a booster vaccine programme for people aged 60 and over would begin “immediately”, following a recommendation from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).“Over the course of the last two weeks we have seen a worsening of the Covid situation,” Mr Martin added. “These figures are a cause of concern and a timely reminder of how dangerous this virus is.”The Government had hoped to fully lift the vast majority of Covid-19 restrictions from October 22nd but the recent surge in cases has seen these plans amended. Instead, many restrictions will remain in place.A Covid-19 vaccine certificate will still be required for indoor hospitality and events, while the use of face masks and social distancing will remain in place until 2022.“Government has made its decision in relation to Nphet advice,” Mr Martin said.The Government has also agreed to an enhanced role for antigen testing. Mr Martin said the State’s rapid testing expert advisory group will provide a recommendation on the use of voluntary self-testing by asymptomatic iniduals who plan to attend risky activities, such as nightclubs.Antigen tests will also be used for fully vaccinated people who are close contacts and have no symptoms.Mr Martin added: “The progress we have made together is real and it has to be protected. The changes we have made gives us the space to make sure that the next step we take is safe.“If you are indoors with other people, wear a mask. If you are running a business that is bringing people indoors, check for vaccination certs. If you have not been vaccinated or had a second vaccination, please make arrangement to get fully vaccinated. It is safe and it is free.”‘Live with Covid’Mr Varadkar also told reporters that Nphet had considered recommending a full pause of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions but had ultimately recommended against such a course of action because the Covid-19 situation would not change in the next number of weeks“We are going to have to live with Covid. It won’t be easy,” Mr Varadkar said.During their meeting Ministers considered the latest recommendations from Nphet, which said restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing must remain in place until February 2022.In a letter to Ministers, the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, warned the epidemiological situation in Ireland had deteriorated and was now uncertain and precarious.The latest estimates show there are about 370,000 people who have yet to be vaccinated or fully vaccinated against Covid and these people will not be able to avail of indoor hospitality.The Government has also decided that the current enhanced illness benefit payment arrangements for Covid-19 will remain in place. This benefit is available at a rate of €350 a week, with no waiting days, for employees and self-employed people who are certified by a registered medical practitioner as diagnosed with Covid-19 or a probable source of infection of Covid-19.With regards to international travel, intending passengers will continue to require evidence of a valid PCR test result, unless exempt (such as vaccinated or recovered or children under 12), while airlines continue to be required to check PCR test results and to deny boarding to passengers who do not have acceptable documentation.It is understood Niac recommended a dose of the Pfizer vaccine for those aged between 60 and 79 who have been vaccinated. The booster shot will be given at least five months after the previous dose.There were 2,399 new case reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Tuesday, the highest number of since January of this year.

Photograph: Julien BehalIt only seems like yesterday when Covid was sitting up in bed doing the crossword and contemplating a soft boiled egg for breakfast.The patient had been progressing and the Government told everyone to expect a full discharge on October 22nd, this Friday. There would be dancing again in dimly lit places where lips collide and drink is served into the early hours.Nightclubs would reopen and live full capacity concerts would resume and people would be allowed sit once more at a bar counter in a public house prior to falling into a dimly lit place after midnight.But on Tuesday, it fell to the Taoiseach to break the bad news to the Dáil.“The virus has taken a turn for the worst” announced Micheál Martin, with a heavy heart. “The trajectory went kinda wrong over the last two weeks.”Not only that, but Covid’s setback is now further compromised by a severe case of The Anomalies. Nobody understands The Anomalies, not least the government. But they are causing severe anxiety for the hospitality and entertainment industry.Covid’s worsening condition has put the kibosh on a full reopening of these sectors. Or has it?Immediately before the Dáil sitting, the Government held a press conference to outline details of the long awaited and much anticipated return of carousing. But after all the talking the rules for re-engagement were clear as mud.Neither the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste nor the leader of the Green Party were in a position to offer a solid prognosis for how Ireland will cope with Covid in the coming months while complications arising from The Anomalies left them sounding very hazy on detail about Friday’s lifting of restrictions.It’ll be February now at the earliest before they can give any sort of long-term update.Here’s Leo Varadkar - he is a qualified doctor: “You know, the absolutely easiest thing to do is to shut down the country and the second easiest thing to do is to open it up fully” mused Dr Leo, prodding the landscape around Covid’s distended belly.Yep. Just as he suspected.“Everything between is full of anomalies and full of complications.”‘Evolve, develop and deliver’What to do?“We have to help provide the pass, the mask, the test and the boost” said Eamon Ryan. The sectors which have been waiting to get going for nearly two years will get “further details” as they reopen and “we are going to have to evolve, develop and deliver.”The three leaders stressed that the usual basics - masks, hand hygiene and social distancing - will apply across the board, except where anomalies arise in which case “sector-specific guidance and protocols” will be dispensed.Did this mean social distancing might not be required in nightclubs?To dance or not to dance - that is the simple question.“So, I’m not going into the specific details” Micheál told Sean Defoe of Newstalk. “It’s the generality.”Just three days out from their big reopening, after months and months of discussion about it, do hard pressed club and music venue owners not deserve more than mere “generality”?And then the Taoiseach told his (predominantly) youthful audience of political reporters “what traditionally happens in a nightclub will continue to happen in a nightclub.”That got a knowing laugh from the crowd.Under the new carousing code, the ban on pub patrons approaching or sitting at a bar counter continues. But in a club, they will be able to sashay up and order what they want.Then there are the live music concerts in big venues. Strictly no dancing in the aisles. No standing up. Sitting down dancing only, and socially distanced at that. It’s the sanitised hand jive or nothing. Where’s the sense in that, with tickets already sold out for major standing events on the back of the Government’s promise of an October 22nd reopening?Micheál muttered about “practical arrangements” having to be made in some circumstances.“There will be anomalies - straight up with you. There will be anomalies.”Sketchy proposalsIn the Dáil, Catherine Murphy, co-leader of the Social Democrats, couldn’t get her head around the sketchy proposals currently causing consternation in the nighttime hospitality sector.“It’s very confusing” she sighed, blasting the Government for “yet another startling display of confusion, incoherence and chaos.” She forgot to mention “contradiction”.Three days out from reopening and the rules have been rewritten with business closed for the best part of two years going to “get advice at the last possible moment” on how to start up again. Ah well.“You could probably dance to the bar for a drink,” she supposed.But the reason the rejigged restrictions are so late in the day is because Covid took a turn for the worst when nobody was expecting it, argued the Taoiseach. “Covid does not respect weekly decision making on a precision basis.”His Cabinet gets no credit for anything. The Oppostion was dead set against previous restrictions and measures brought in by the Government. They screamed blue murder over the introduction of vaccination certificates last Summer, yet this facilitated the reopening of much of the hospitality industry.“Anything we have reopened so far has stayed open” sniffed Micheál, yet he wasn’t hearing any Oppostion voices the Opposition. “Always trying to pick holes.”Aontú’s Peadar Tóibín wanted a Dáil debate on the Government’s handling of the crisis. Ireland has severe restrictions and high vaccination rates yet Covid numbers are high and rising.“By any measure this is a disaster and failure of government,” said Tóibín.The Taoiseach rejected his assertion and his “completely wrong and inappropriate” language. “I know enough about a global pandemic - they can come back to bite you at anytime” he told Peadar.The Government’s latest decision was “taking note of the fact that the trajectory of the virus has taken a turn for the worse”.The mean some key protections had to be retained, such as “the vaccination cert, which I know you were virulently against” and masks and other issues where appropriate.Micheál’s statement enraged the Meath TD, who returned to the House before the Taoiseach left demanding an apology. Aontú was never “anti-mask” he fulminated. “That is absolutely not true,” he shouted.Bernard Durkan, in the chair, battled to maintain order. As the shouting intensified, Bernard was in danger of becoming more airborne than the Covid virus. The Taoiseach, meanwhile, watched briefly then gathered his papers and left.Deputy Tóibín said he had the audio of this “slur” for evidence. But perhaps, if he plays it again, he might find that the Taoiseach did not call him or his party anti-maskers. It was merely his Cork cadence confusing the matter.As if any more confusion was needed."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"City with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"uk officials keeping close eye on new mutation of delta variant","story":"A Covid-19 testing site in England. Photograph: Jacob KingPA WireThe UK government is keeping a “close eye” on a descendant of the coronavirus Delta variant that is being seen in a growing number of cases.Downing Street said it was monitoring the AY4.2 variant, but insisted there was no evidence it spreads more easily.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “It’s something we’re keeping a very close eye on.“There’s no evidence to suggest that this variant ... the AY4.2 one ... is more easily spread.“There’s no evidence for that, but as you would expect we’re monitoring it closely and won’t hesitate to take action if necessary.”Scientists say AY4.2 carries two characteristic mutations in the spike, Y145H and A222V, both of which have been found in various other coronavirus lineages since the beginning of the pandemic.However, they have remained at low frequency until now.The first strains carrying both mutations were sequenced in April 2020, and either are found in any variant of concern.Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology at University College London and director of the UCL Genetics Institute, said: “The A222V was found in the B.1.177 lineage that swept Europe in the summer of 2020, but careful follow-up analyses pointed to the lineage likely having no inherent transmissibility advantage and that its spread was most likely caused by demographic processes.”He added that neither mutation was an obvious candidate for increased transmissibility, but that mutations can have different, sometimes unexpected, effects in different strains.Prof Balloux explained: “As AY.4.2 is still at fairly low frequency, a 10 per cent increase in its transmissibility could have caused only a small number of additional cases.“As such it hasn’t been driving the recent increase in case numbers in the UK.”He said the emergence of another more transmissible strain would be “suboptimal”, adding: “This is not a situation comparable to the emergence of Alpha and Delta that were far more transmissible (50 per cent or more) than any strain in circulation at the time.“Here we are dealing with a potential small increase in transmissibility that would not have a comparable impact on the pandemic.”AY4.2 is rare outside the UK, and there have been only three cases detected in the US so far.In Denmark, the other country that, besides the UK, has excellent genomic surveillance in place, it reached a 2 per cent frequency but has gone down since.Work is under way to test whether it may be less well recognised by antibodies. –PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"the us s political and business elites no longer agree on china","story":"‘Decoupling’, the dream of some in that White House, if not of Trump himself, has faded from both word and thought. Photograph: Mark FelixAFP AFP via Getty The business news has become a portal to the recent past. Researchers at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, tell investors to as much as triple their exposure to China. Goldman Sachs is cleared to take full control of its securities business there. Apple, at least for now, withholds a Koran app from Chinese users, after officials expressed qualms.“Three is a column,” goes the rule. But it is not a duty to stop there. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reports more confidence among its members than at any time since the trade tiff began. As for Goldman’s coup, JPMorgan Chase had already pipped it to the landmark of full ownership in China.No one in Washington in, say, 2018 would have bet on much of the above. In their book , the reporters Bob Davis and Lingling Wei chart the raw meetings between US business and Chinese leaders in the early years of Donald Trump’s administration. Our president is not an aberration, said the C-suite stars, but the voice of a fairly aggrieved country. Some worked with him to press Beijing for concessions. Business, once China’s friend in Washington, its feather-smoother with hostile White Houses, had cooled.For what has happened since, two theories do the rounds. One is that China answered the grumbles about market access and much else. US trade representative Katherine Tai denies this. The other dwells on the bottomless naivety of business. Reputational harm, governmental caprice: the risks of trading in China have paled next to the immediate lure of a vast market.Whatever the cause, the result is unmistakable. America’s public and private elites are no longer as one on China, if they ever were. In Washington, vigilance to Beijing is the nearest thing there is to a bipartisan verity. Democrats, no less than Republicans, brood over Chinese gains in artificial intelligence and hypersonic missiles. Successive governments have tried to knit a web of Asian and Australasian friends by way of counterweight. Trump’s tariffs remain largely in place.Commercial imperativesIn Wall Street and beyond, though, commercial imperatives are reasserting themselves. There is no outright contradiction here: it is not as if the government barred or even discouraged all business with China. There is no lack of logic, either. If US firms don’t seize the openings, ones from Europe or elsewhere will. But consider the mental bifurcation required of those who together run the US. “Blunting Chinese power and order” is how Rush Doshi, a scholar turned administration official, has described the national mission. At the same time, the US is helping its rival put its savings to good use and evolve its capital markets. (Wordplay, isn’t it, what counts as a “strategic” sector?)In fact, given the revolving door between government and business – hear it creak through overuse – iniduals might find themselves stifling and developing China in consecutive jobs. And this is before the financial enmeshment of the two countries deepens and matures. At what point does it become eccentric to refer to “the” US strategy on China?True enough, the two nations’ tech sectors are more distant than they were. (Even LinkedIn, at the lighter end of things, has closed its app in China.) But the Trump-era assumption that frost spreads, that wider trade would suffer, looks rash now. “Decoupling”, the dream of some in that White House, if not of Trump himself, has faded from both word and thought. When the US commerce secretary says there is “no point” entertaining it now, it is as much a bow to reality as a salute of progress.‘Lukewarm’ warIf what beckons is less a cold war than a lukewarm one, with contact maintained through economics, so much the better. But the US has not had to wrestle with such ambiguities before. It has never been so tied to an existential rival. As a doctrinally communist state, not a titular one, Soviet Russia wasn’t waving in foreign wealth managers by the Audi-load. America was a relatively closed economy when it was up against wartime Germany, imperial Japan and the Spanish empire.If anything, there is something of turn-of-the-20th-century Europe about the US and China: the same economic integration and political froideur, the same sense of countries at once entwined and not. There is no reason the contradictions should unravel with similar force, but nor can they can be denied or glossed over. It is the mark of free societies that the elite is not a monolith, toiling on a shared national project. The dread is that it is also their frailty. – Financial Times Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dennis hutchings interview not just about clearing name trials","story":"Dennis Hutchings walks 20 yards out of the cafe on the Plymouth seafront and stops abruptly, unable to breathe. He gulps for air, his body in contortions. Mr Hutchings, 80 and a great grandfather, is suffering from heart failure and has fluid on the lungs. On Saturday Oct 2 he will travel to hospital for kidney dialysis - three times a week his blood is cleaned and filtered - and then on Sunday he will drive to Bristol airport and take a flight to Belfast. The next day - this Monday - Mr Hutchings, a former staff sergeant in the Life Guards regiment, will go on trial for the attempted murder of a young man, shot and killed in County Tyrone, more than 47 years ago.The trial - six years after Mr Hutchings was first arrested - is deeply embarrassing for Boris Johnson, who had promised to end the prosecution of Northern Ireland veterans.Instead, in the middle of the Conservative Party conference, a dying soldier will stand in the dock over events that took place almost half a century ago.His doctors have advised Mr Hutchings not to travel and were prepared to provide him with a medical certificate that would have caused the trial to be postponed indefinitely. Instead, Mr Hutchings will walk into the court in Laganside in Belfast on Monday with his head held high, defiant and medals pinned to his chest. He wanted to wear his uniform too but he has been told not to by both police and the Ministry of Defence.“I will wear my medals in court. I was going to wear my uniform but I have been advised against it. The security people in Northern Ireland, police and officials in the Ministry of Defence advised me against it. They said it would cause too many problems,” said Mr Hutchings. The last six years of his life have been wrecked by the investigation into the death of John Patrick Cunningham, a 27-year-old man with learning difficulties, shot in the back as he ran across a field on June 15, 1974. Another soldier - known only as Soldier B and who has since died - is thought to have fired the fatal shots. No ballistics evidence exists. Mr Hutchings said: “My consultant gives me six months to live. The kidney problems have got more serious and I have heart failure as well. My consultant says six months if I’m lucky. He could have signed me off sick but I am going to court. I could have got out of this trial but I don’t want to.Mr Hutchings points out Northern Ireland back then was a war zone. He dismisses the gentler term The Troubles.“It was no such thing. It was a conflict. In places it was a war. More servicemen were killed in Northern Ireland than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined but that hardly gets mentioned.”The trial, in front of a judge only, is listed for six weeks with proceedings halted every two days so that Mr Hutchings can undergo dialysis at an undisclosed Northern Ireland hospital. His hands and arms are black and blue, bruised from constant treatment and the prodding of needles. He spent 26 years in the Army, signing up at the age of 18 in October 1959, after three and half years working down the mines in Blyth in Northumberland. He had wanted to join the Navy but couldn’t find the recruiting office in Newcastle and was signed up instead by the Army.“I wouldn’t do anything differently again,” he said, reflecting on his predicament. And that includes the day of the fateful shooting. He is insistent he shot high over John Patrick Cunningham’s head, purely in an attempt to get him to stop. The shots he fired, he said, were “all in the air”, adding: “I had to aim in the air,” pointing out that his men were converging on the field and there was a great danger of one of them being killed in any crossfire. As Cunningham lay dying, Mr Hutchings tried to save the young man’s life, applying a field dressing to the wounds. At this point, Soldier B told him he had fired the fatal shot.Mr Hutchings was investigated at the time and subsequently cleared of all wrongdoing. He was even mentioned in despatches for an incident the day before the fatal shooting when he had arrested six suspected members of the IRA without firing a shot.Mr Hutchings’ life was turned upside down when police arrived on his doorstep at his home in Cawsand, in Cornwall, at 7.30am on April 15 2015, to arrest him and search his house. He was held in a police cell, transferred on a flight to Northern Ireland and questioned 26 times over the next three days. Harold Shipman, the worst mass murderer in British legal history, was interviewed by police no more than 10 times, says Mr Hutchings.“It is totally unfair they are putting me through this,” he said. “If this was anywhere other than Northern Ireland this case would never have got this far.” His family too are devastated, his partner, 15 years his junior, struggling to cope.Mr Hutchings is scathing not only of successive prime ministers who have promised to end the prosecutions but failed to do so but the “spineless” unnamed senior military figures who have refused to give support. He reserves praise for Johnny Mercer, the former defence minister who quit in protest at the ongoing prosecutions and investigations into military veterans, and who will accompany the accused to Belfast to give his support.The two have become friends and meet regularly for lunch. Mr Mercer, the local MP in Portsmouth and a former captain in the Army, will pointedly avoid his party’s annual conference to be with Mr Hutchings. Successive prime ministers and ministers, said Mr Mercer, “have been too cowardly and weak to do anything about it”. He went on: “They don’t want to hear Dennis’s story.”After six years, a judge will finally decide Mr Hutchings’ guilt or innocence. There may well be other cases in the pipeline, with as many as 231 cases still under investigation. “The problem is,” said Mr Hutchings, “nobody really gives a s---. That is what I have worked out.”More from NewsFacebook \u0026#39plans to change its name\u0026#39 in major rebrandPolice handed new powers to evict TravellersHate preachers face more time in jail under new tougher sentencing guidelinesMake threatening deportation to coerce women a crime, says watchdogPrevent is failing to target Islamist extremists, report warnsWe risk being frightened back into lockdownMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"papal paradox woke pope alienating flock","story":"It’s not that often that a video message from a Pope to a global gathering goes viral, but that is what happened this weekend, when Pope Francis addressed the World Meeting of Popular Movements in the US. To an audience of community leaders, anti-poverty campaigners and environmental groups, he began arrestingly: “Dear social poets… that is what I like to call you: social poets. You are social poets because you have the ability and the courage to create hope where there appears to be only waste and exclusion.”He went on to attack social media companies for encouraging “hate speech, grooming, fake news” and to condemn agribusiness and mining for destroying habitats. He then called for a basic income and shorter working hours… And that wasn’t even the half of it.When the 84-year-old Jesuit Pope gets the bit between his teeth, he can be very good value, a genuine populist. He is much less of an intellectual than his predecessor, Pope Benedict, but he gets on the radar: after one visit to the EU, he left in a battered old Fiat. It’s a real pity that he isn’t attending the climate conference in Glasgow, because he would have lambasted all the global leaders there for inaction and we could have had another picture of him and Greta Thunberg together – the last one was in 2019 – beaming.He is popular with many younger Catholics. In a survey last year by Stephen Bullivant and Ben Clements, 55 per cent of young Catholics in Britain (especially mass-goers) thought he was a change for the better for the papacy. My daughter, 14, says that her age cohort likes him. “He’s liberal, “she says. “And he interacts with you.”But while he can reach parts few other modern Popes reach, he is still a isive figure within the Church, of which he is head.Not to put too fine a point upon it, lots of Catholics can’t stand him – liberals, as well as Conservatives. This week, in a riveting piece for The Spectator website headlined “Is the Pope a Protestant?”, Damian Thompson argues that you could indeed say the Pope has “gone Protestant”. He says: “Francis may be pursuing a liberal policy agenda, but it’s also quirky and incoherent. He is Jesuitical in the pejorative sense of the term, constantly shifting his position in order to keep both his opponents and supporters on their toes. But his leadership has none of the positive attributes of his order: it has created an intellectual mess.”This is strong stuff, though not half as strong as a priest he quotes, who expressed the hope that the Pope would drop dead that very night. Francis himself intimated that there are people who’d like to see him off. After his colon operation in July, someone asked him how he was. “Still alive,” he replied, “though some people want me to die.” If you’re Pope, being paranoid doesn’t mean people aren’t out to get you.The groups he most often sees as the enemy are conservatives hostile to his approach. And he doesn’t pull his punches with them. Though he didn’t mention them by name, he referred to America’s biggest religious broadcaster, EWTN, recently as “the work of the devil”. They speak well of him, too.He’s especially combative towards “backward-looking” critics of his new direction for the Church – towards a synodal structure in which grassroots parishioners have a say in how the Church is run. We’ll see how that turns out.Most of the people who are uneasy with the direction of the papacy are indeed conservatives. But some are liberals, like the former Irish president, Mary McAleese, who declared earlier this year that she was unimpressed by the Pope whose “chummy words to the press often quite reasonably raise hopes of church reform which are subsequently almost invariably dashed by firm restatements of unchanged church teaching”. He raises hopes, but “he is the Pope who toes the old hard line”.McAleese’s particular preoccupation is gay rights. On this and on the question of whether orced and remarried people can receive communion, the Pope can give off mixed messages. He’s undoubtedly genuinely anxious to be receptive and welcoming to gay people in the Church, but he’s never blessed same-sex unions or suggested that the Church could do so. As for giving communion to people who would be traditionally considered to be living in adultery – those who remarry while their previous spouse is alive – he has told bishops and priests to be “pastoral” and consider the people in front of them. Is that yes or no?And what about politicians who vote to make abortion accessible, including late-term abortions? Can they receive communion? On the actual issue, Francis is unequivocal. “Abortion is homicide,” he declared to journalists recently, which is clear. But then he went on to declare that, as a priest, he had never refused communion to anyone, which isn’t much use to US bishops who must decide what to do when pro-choice Joe Biden pitches up for communion. He talks tough on abortion, but then gives a warm reception to pro-abortion Nancy Pelosi when she came to the Vatican.As for the really terrible succession of scandals around child abuse by members of the Church, most recently in France, Francis is as shocked as anyone. Asked for his reaction to the report on abuse in France, he said simply: “Shame.” And yet it took forever for his commission dealing with the issue to reach conclusions and for them to be put into effect. He is a reformer who often seems to lack the organisational drive to see his reforms through.But has he actually done anything to broaden the appeal of the Church in a secular culture? Professor Stephen Bullivant, a sociologist at St Mary’s University, observes: “If you ask people why they like him, then you often discover that they – paradoxically – see him as beingembodying everything that they think the Catholic Church isn’t – ie, they see him as a pro-science, pro-LGBTQ, pro-environment, religious and moral relativist. The trouble is, of course, that those general impressions aren’t terribly accurate either of Francis or the Church.“This means two things. Firstly, that people’s attraction to (their construction of) Pope Francis doesn’t end up making them any more attracted to the Catholic Church. And secondly, they end up constantly being disappointed by things Pope Francis actually does or says. (My favourite example of this whole phenomenon is a Rolling Stone article, ‘Guess the Cool Pope Isn’t So Cool After All’).”Another paradox of the Pope is that he may be liberal, but he’s a liberal authoritarian. This was particularly evident in his crackdown on those who attend mass celebrated according to the so-called Tridentine rite, which was the norm before the Second Vatican Council. Here, nice Pope Francis showed his SS side, in obliging congregations who wanted to hear mass in the old rite to get permission from their bishops and newly ordained priests to obtain permission from the Vatican. Trouble is, those congregations include many families and young people.He’s complicated, then, Pope Francis – but he inspires enormous loyalty. Eamon Duffy, the historian whose book on the papacy, Saints and Sinners (Yale University Press), stops before Francis, says simply that “he’s the Pope I’ve been waiting for my entire life”. And by the looks of things, Francis hasn’t run out of steam.More from NewsFacebook \u0026#39plans to change its name\u0026#39 in major rebrandPolice handed new powers to evict TravellersHate preachers face more time in jail under new tougher sentencing guidelinesMake threatening deportation to coerce women a crime, says watchdogPrevent is failing to target Islamist extremists, report warnsWe risk being frightened back into lockdownMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases rising 323 uk","story":"Covid cases rising in  UK areas as top  locations with biggest increase namedBath  North East Somerset has the highest rate in the UK, with , new coronavirus cases in the seven days to October  - the equivalent of . per , peoplethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-new-cases-deaths-october-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:QrlfFY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Cameron Mitchell, , from Carlisle, suffers frequent seizures and muscle spasms and is fed through a tube, according to his law firm Leigh Day. But lawyers said his Personal Independence Payment, and his mothers’ Carer’s Allowance, were stopped because he spent  days in hospital to June. PIP benefit is worth up to £. a week to help with the costs of being disabled. But it is only paid for the first  days of a stay in a care home, hospital or prison. The Department for Work and Pensionsargues this is because the NHS is funding someone’s care during a long-term stay in hospital. But Cameron’s mother and carer Nicola Clulow is pursuing a High Court case on his behalf, saying the -day rule breaches human rights law on discrimination.  She argued that even though Cameron was in hospital, she still needed to provide essential care - including spotting when a seizure was imminent, communicating with him and helping him move around. She said his family lost more than £, in benefit payments over the period, despite having to spend £ a week on food and transport. Ms Clulow, whose case is backed by evidence from Mencap, Carers UK and Marie Curie, said: “We are requesting this review to the PIP  day hospitalisation rule on behalf of Cameron and many other adults just like him, who due to complex and multiple profound learning disabilities, cannot have all of their needs met by the NHS while in hospital. “Cameron requires the constant care and knowledge of his needs from a known carer whenever he is hospital. “This doesnapost change on day , but the financial means to enable us to provide this support does.”From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

Lawyers first sent a pre-action letter to the Department for Work and Pensionsin July. But in September the DWP ruled they would not make an exception. Cameron’s mother has now decided to request a judicial review - where judges could declare the entire policy unlawful. Leigh Day solicitor Carolin Ott said: “As a result of Cameron’s profound and multiple learning disabilities, he cannot be effectively cared for without assistance from his known carers, his parents. “A one-size-fits-all approach does not work for patients like Cameron. “It is crucial that severely disabled patients’ complex needs are taken into account throughout their hospital or hospice stay, and not disregarded after  days.” Comment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsCameron MitchellNHSHospitalsCare homesCourt caseHuman rightsNursing homes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The bizarre tactic was likened to “what kidnappers do” by the Public Interest Law Centre, a legal group which fights “systemic injustice”. Claimants were also ordered to send a photo of themselves outside their open front door, a photo next to their street sign with their right hand holding it, and a photo of their ID card next to their face. The request specied that the newspaper should be “your local newspaper for the area you live . This should be dated the same day you upload the photo.” Universal Credit ’s Director-General Neil Couling at first said the request “looks suspicious”.But he later confirmed the message, received by a PILC client on an online Universal Credit account, was genuine. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter - and join the debate in the comments below.  It is part of an exercise to re-check around a million Universal Credit cases for possible fraud, after overpayments almost doubled to £.billion during Covid. Mr Couling previously said thousands of people would get a “tap on the shoulder” this year, after security checks were relaxed during the worst phase of the pandemic. It is thought the drastic measures are being applied as a last resort to only a tiny minority of those cases that are being re-checked for fraud. One Whitehall source indicated fraudulent activity had been found on up to half of the cases subjected to the most stringent checks. But Benjamin Morgan of the PILC warned the demands showed a “dystopian culture of suspicion”. He told the Independent: “It is hard enough for many claimants to submit universal credit claims online in the first place due to digital literacy issues and other vulnerabilities – let alone fulfil such exacting and, frankly, invasive conditions.” Another claimant told the website: “It was a stressful experience, and I’m tech savvy… These are the sort of people who will probably find themselves in financial hardship in a few months’ time. It seems like [the DWP] is making it up as it goes along.”Mr Couling confirmed the requests were genuine during an exchange on Twitter.He said: “Initially we used a ‘trust and protect’ approach. “We knew some would abuse that, I’ve been very open about that, but it was for the greater good. But we always said we would go back and check. And this is part of that, given restrictions mean we can’t yet use our Jobcentres to the full.” A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensionssaid: “At the start of the pandemic we suspended face-to-face verication of new claims as part of our Trust and Protect scheme to ensure all legitimate claimants got paid. “We always said we would go back and very claims, in order to protect the public purse, as some people sadly chose to abuse the temporary arrangements. “We are now checking cases and have implemented this approach temporarily in a small number of cases where a claimant has been unable to interact with us remotely, ahead of theof in-person verication at Jobcentres.” Comment MORE ON JobcentresDepartment for Work and PensionsFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The head of the NHS Confederation Matthew Taylor, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said the government needs to take action now. It comes after deaths from Covid peaked at  - the highest seen for months - while the seven-day average for Covid- cases stands at , a day. The government has warned that working from home and vaccine passports could be introducedthe NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed. But Mr Taylor has said action needs to brought in now or it will derail efforts to tackle the backlog of five million patients waiting for treatment, reports the . He added: We are right on the edge – and it is the middle of October. It would require an incredible amount of luck for us not to find ourselves in the midst of a profound crisis over the next three months. The government ought to not just announce that we’re moving to Plan B, but it should be Plan B plus. We should do what’s in Plan B in terms of masks… working from home, but also we should try to achieve the kind of national mobilisation that we achieved in the first and second waves, where the public went out of their way to support and help the health service. As he urged people to avoid risky behaviour, Mr Taylor said inaction would lead to a really profound crisis in the health and social care through the winter. Meanwhile, one of the architects behind the first lockdowns has warned restrictions may need to be brought back in. Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfrom Imperial College London, said Covid hospitalisations are doubling every five weeks as immunity wanes. Just . million of the . million at-risk people who had their second jab at least six months ago have had their third dose, and the gap is growing. Professor Ferguson said: “I don’t think we’re looking at another lockdown... the worst case here are demands on the NHS... it’s very unlikely we’ll see anything like the levels of deaths we saw last year, for instance. “Coming into the winter, there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented, which involves some rolling back of measures, but I doubt that we’ll ever get close to lockdown we were in January of this year.” He added: “I don’t think it’s a reason to panic right now but I would certainly like to see vaccination booster doses accelerated, vaccination for teenagers accelerated.” Comment MORE ON NHSCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As the shock waves reverberate around the death of a good man, the hunt for answers continues without even a hint of self-awareness.My Mirror colleague, Ros Wynne-Jones, is behind the brilliant Britain Talks campaign which aims to get the country doing just that.The trouble is, so many of us still don’t talk. So many of us WhatsApp, email, Facebook or tweet, tapping away in a cess pit with a race to the bottom in terms of our discourse. The empathy has gone. The respect for peers and authority, a staple of older generations, is a thing of the past. It won’twith screens between MPs and their constituents or police officers on the doors of surgeries. They are the ideas of a regime with a left hand over its eyes and their right hand feeling around in the dark. Complacency will eventually replace the concern to be seen to be doing something anyway after the killing of Sir David Amess and, heartbreakingly, we will be back here in a few years’ time - just as after Jo Cox in , Stephen Timms in  and Nigel Jones in .We are all at risk from an atmosphere that threatens to consume us, never mind extremists. My jaw hit the floor when we heard that the inidual held in connection with the death threat sent to MP Chris Bryant is  years of age. I remember, as we neared the end of the last lockdown, hearing friends’ fears that things could explode after it was lted with so many people having spent so long shouting at each other online.  Don’t kid yourself that the trolls are teenagers or twenty-somethings still living at home and eating cornflakes way past lunchtime in their pyjamas. Many wear suits and ties, carry laptops and enjoy top jobs with big s. None see any problem hammering politicians on all sides or the likes of Meghan Markle. Even the debate about finally cracking down on hate speech online is quite something when ordinary people, footballers, celebrities and other politicians have been begging for it for years now without success. Ask the likes of Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler.  Justice Secretary Dominic Raab and MPs such as Bernard Jenkin and Mark Francois are among those now urging us all to be kinder.Tell that to Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, both called out by England footballer Tyrone Mings for refusing to condemn those booing our national team for taking the knee. This is the least kind government in living memory.A government that wants to hand immunity to people causing others to drown in the English Channel. A government whose ministers belted out karaoke tunes at their party conference earlier this month on the day they cut Universal Credit for millions.  A government whose hostile environment campaign has seen lives lost and millions of families devastated. A government whose Prime Minister was given the chance to dial down his racially offensive rhetoric about Muslim women and black people and chose instead to double down. When MP Paula Sherrf complained in parliament in  of the abuse and harassment she and other female MPs were being subjected to, Johnson suggested “the best way to ensure that every parliamentarian is properly safe and [to] dial down the current anxiety…[was] to get Brexit done”. None of that justies violence. Ever. What it underscores is our need for a period of introspection and the drawing of a line in the sand. It should never have taken the passing of a good man to spark that.

The part of it I particularly resented as a child was the weekends – my dad had already been gone all day and most evenings during the week at the House of Commons, and then every other weekend he’d disappear too  I moaned about it to him once. We had an easy, light-hearted ­relationship but I remember him being very serious when he replied to my whinge. “What I’m doing at weekends,” he told me, “is the most important part of my job.” What he was referring to was surgeries. Every other Friday evening and Saturday daytime, he made himself available to his constituents – they didn’t need an appointment, they could just walk in and talk about their problems. In the wake of the senseless killing of Sir David Amess there have been calls for MPs’ surgeries to end, or become virtual. But it would be piling disaster on top of tragedyeither of these things happen.MPs must be kept safe, for sure – but this face-to-face contact with the people they represent is essential. My dad was an MP for an area of Birmingham for  years, but before that he was briefly MP for the area where I grew up, where my mum still lives. It was one term,  years ago, and yet to this day I can’t walk down the high street there without being stopped by a stranger who will tell me about something my dad did for them. A way he helped, improved their lives, that they will never forget.  That process, whatever it went on to achieve, had always started because they came to talk to him at his surgery. My dad was right – it’s the most important part of an MP’s job. Working for the people who voted for them. Listening to those who feel they don’t have a voice. Helping anyone who feels helpless. My dad would regularly marvel at how much a letter on House Of Commons headed paper could quickly achieve, in situations that had been rattling on for years.

Remaining powers in the Coronavirus Act were extended without a full vote in Parliament, despite a tiny handful of MPs shouting “no!” when askedthey wanted to pass it.While the Coronavirus Act is not behind actual lockdowns in England and Wales - powers for those flow through a separate law passed in  - it still allows authorities to impose a string of restrictions on the public. Until last month, these included a power to detain people suspected of having Covid for up to  days, which was used  times in the first year of the Act. The Act also included powers for the Health Secretary to shut down inidual events, gatherings, shops or restaurantsthey pose a specic risk. And the Act allowed authorities to shut inidual schools, as well as ports, railway stations and airport, where there was a specic danger to public health. However the powers for events, venues, schools and ports were not used in the first year of the Act, because authorities could rely on other lockdown laws instead. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter - and join the debate in the comments below.  Facing pressure from Tory MPs, Boris Johnson announced that the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - would expire last month.The means only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - now remain in the Act. However, the Act also includes laws designed to improve the state’s response to the pandemic. Those include the temporary registration of social workers, paramedics and other NHS stafftrainees or retirees need to surge into the system, and the ability to pay sick pay from day one of absence. Labour MP Dawn Butler said the “authoritarian” Act had been passed with “no scrutiny” and “it was never proportionate”. She added she was “pleased” that the most draconian powers - including detention powers - had been removed. She added  charges were incorrect, affecting “distressed people in the pandemic”. Former Tory rebel Mark Harper said he would no longer oppose the extension of the Act after some of the most offensive powers on detention were removed. The chair of the Covid recovery group raised concerns that the booster jabs roll-out was not going fast enough and should be sped up to put us in the strongest possible position ahead of the winter. But Tory MP Sir John Redwood said the Act should now lapse because there had been a material improvement in the situation despite soaring cases. What is the reason why we have to have these powers hanging over our head when there doesnapost seem to be a need to use them  he askd. Ex-cabinet minister Dr Liam Fox added: There is a strong resentment in many quarters that I have to say that I share about giving any Government extension to powers that are quite as blank as these are.But Health Secretary Sajid Javid has defended continuing some Covid- provisions, arguing they were still necessary and proportionate to help with the pressure.He told MPs: We do certainly expect more pressure as we head into winter, weaposve been very open about that and that is why the vaccination programme, both the Covid vaccination programme, the boosters and the flu vaccination programme remain important. But there are provisions in this Act which are still, I believe, still necessary and proportionate to help with the pressure. “That is for example the registration of healthcare and social care workers, also the power to discontinue healthcare assessments for people being discharged from the NHS. I think it is wise especially heading into the winter when we donapost at this stage know just how signicant the pressures will be to have that flexibility. Labour backed the renewal of the Act because of measures that meant statutory sick pay was in place from day one, not day four, but called for more effective scrutiny. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth welcomed the removal of some of the more draconian elements such as the power to detain potentially infectious people. But he warned: This public health crisis is not over, Covid has not gone away. We can learn to live with the virus but that is not the same as pretending it no longer exists.Yesterday we recorded , infections. There are now  in hospital,  in ICU. Everyday on average  of our fellow citizens are dying from this deadly disease. With hardly any protective measures and delayed vaccination, theto school last month has seen record numbers of children become infected. The ongoing pandemic is making existing inequalities worse and worse. We need to go further. I never want to see a lockdown either locally in my home city of Leicester, or nationally, again. Mr Ashworth warned that the jabs booster programme was stalling, adding: The wall of defence is crumbling. He called for retired medics who helped with the initial vaccine roll-out to step up once again. One month into the booster programme, only half of eligible over-s have received a booster jab. Of the . million who had a second jab more than six months ago, fewer than . million have had the booster.

The Tories claim the UK will be a world leader on tackling climate change, but how does their plan stack up and is there a sting in the tail for you The PM says the UK is on course to build back greener from the Covid pandemic, but Labour has said that between pages of plans, strategies and hot air, there is still a chasm between the rhetoric and the reality.We weed out the hidden nasties buried in the Governmentaposs climate blueprint.  .

But critics are most worried about the scale of under-investment. The strategy so far includes £bn of investment in the next decade, most of it from the private sector, in what the Government claims will create , jobs.  But it estimates a staggering £bn of combined private and public investment will be needed between  and . While many hope more investment is in the pipeline, Shadow Environment Secretary Ed Miliband said the climate plan appears torpedoed by the Treasury and ministers have offered a tiny fraction of what is needed to meet the challenge.

This would commit the party to spending £bn on climate measures over the next eight years.. More tax hikes and price rises on the cards Despite Boris Johnsonaposs manesto pledge not to raise taxes, the Government admits the task of the UKaposs transition to net zero, in the wake of Covid, means tax hikes cannot be avoided. The Treasury document spells it out in black and white: “Overall, a combination of tax, regulation, spending and other facilitative levers will be required, it says. Some new technologies needed for the switch to net zero - such as heat pumps - are signicantly more expensive, but the Government is pinning its hopes on prices falling as markets scale up. Treasury documents say that “as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values”.  The review, published alongside the Government’s net zero strategy, said it was not possible to forecast how inidual household finances would be hit over the course of a -year transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. . A nuclear power plant not agreed for years The plan vows to “secure a final investment decision on a large-scale nuclear plant by the end of this Parliament”. That will mean a large-scale nuclear plant - possibly on the Sizewell site - is finally built anew in Britain. But nuclear plants take years to assemble, and the end of the Parliament could still be two and a half years away before work even begins. Meanwhile the plan vows to launch “a new £ million Future Nuclear Enabling Fund, retaining options for future nuclear technologies, including Small Modular Reactors, with a number of potential sites including Wylfa in North Wales.” . A decision on hydrogen heating not due until  The government has set the “ambition” that by , all new heating appliances will be low-carbon - like electric heat pumps or hydrogen boilers. But the first mainstream hydrogen boilers - where the gas is used in lieu of the current gas in the mains - won’t be up and running for years. A decision will only be made in , before a “gradual transition that works with the grain of consumer choice”. This means pleas to change the system urgently may fall on deaf ears. . Only £bn for cycling The plan commits £bn for cycling - which in the grand scheme of government spending is not the most earth-shattering sum.  By comparison, the government pledged £bn for “bus services and cycling routes” over the five years from . The plan promises “first hundreds, then thousands of miles” of segregated cycle lanes and at least one zero-emission transport city. . No plan to cut meat consumption The global production of meat - such as beef, chicken and pork - is causing deforestation and accounts for around a third of all planet-heating gases. The landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changereport made clear governments should encourage people to eat less meat. “We don’t want to tell people what to eat,” Hans-Otto Pörtner, IPCC ecologist said. “But it would indeed be beneficial, for both climate and human health,people in many rich countries consumed less meat, andpolitics would create appropriate incentives to that effect.”  But while the Toriesapos strategy supports new nuclear plans and carbon capture projects, it is utterly silent on cutting emissions from livestock and freeing up land for planting trees. . Burden could fall on the poor Treasury documents urge that policies do not pile the economic pain onto the poor - but admit it is a risk. It reads: “As with all economic transitions, ultimately, the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values. These costs and benefits will not fall evenly across households.” But businesses and power-holders are warned seeking to pass the costs onto future taxpayers through borrowing would deviate from the apospolluter paysapos principle, would not be consistent with intergenerational fairness nor fiscal sustainability, and could blunt incentives. . Sht from fossil fuels to blow £bn black hole in UKaposs Budget Moving away from polluting gas and petrols means fuel duty and vehicle excise duty naturally disappear - but the Treasury has warned the lost revenue spells other taxes. No says the cost of net-zero will place “a signicant and permanent fiscal pressure not offset by the temporary measures like carbon pricing.It adds: This principally concerns revenues from Fuel Duty and Vehicle Excise Duty, amounting to £bn in   – equivalent to .% of GDP. Were the current tax system to remain unchanged across the transition period, tax receipts from most fossil fuel related activity will decline towards zero during the first  years of the transition, leaving receipts lower in the s by up to .%. HM Revenue and Customs could raise an extra .% of GDP, the Treasury estimates, with a new carbon tax but it would not close the gap left behind by old fossil fuel taxes. . Your mortgage could get more expensive Ministers are weighing up plans to link mortgages to green home improvements by imposing targets for lenders. The radical reform of the housing market would aim to nudge people to fork out to decarbonise older homes, such as large townhouses or family homes. But the drive could pile costs onto poorer families who may struggle to afford the necessary upgrades to get a cheaper mortgage.  Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The problem is that while some properties can be improved at relatively little cost, other homeowners will find it prohibitively expensive. They may not be able to afford to borrow more, or the cost of changes to older properties may be disproportionately high, so they’d never recoup the cost of the improvements through a sale.” She said that while lower energy bills may offset some people’s costs, “the problem is that while some properties can be improved at relatively little cost, other homeowners will find it prohibitively expensive”. She added: “They may not be able to afford to borrow more, or the cost of changes to older properties may be disproportionately high, so they’d never recoup the cost of the improvements through a sale.” . Government backed out of scrapping diesel cars and gas boilers The Government has banned the sale of any new petrol and diesel car from  and any hybrid car from . But it has stepped back from ordering petrol and diesel cars will be scrapped. “We will work with the grain of consumer choice: no one will be required to rip out their existing boiler or scrap their current car, the net zero strategy reads. Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan also said getting rid of gas boilers would be voluntary as ministers hoped the market would drive change.  “In the short term, yes, of course this is a voluntary scheme … There will be a point at which that changes but, yes, for now that’s the case,” she told Sky News. The international trade secretary said she believed the market would eventually change to make the greener switch more affordable. “At the moment we’re encouraging the market to drive those changes,” she told the BBC. . People buying second-hand electric cars may be saddled with loans The Treasury cannot predict what the second-hand electric car market will look like given that it is a new market. Poorer households are more likely to buy second-hand, but government documents note interest rates in second-hand car finance arrangements are typically signicantly than for new cars. They add access to finance may become increasingly important, suggesting ministers fears lower-income motorists could end up saddled with debt in order to replace their petrol or diesel car. . Failing to act will be MUCH worse Buried in the document is the admission that the costs of reaching net zero - excluding air quality and emissions benefits - will be -% of the UK’s entire GDP in . And despite relatively little investment put forward, the Treasury admits that the UK economy will not escape catastrophecountries do not hit net zero targets. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s recent report showed unmitigated climate change resulting in “debt spiralling up to around % of GDP thanks to the cost of adapting to an ever hotter climate and of more frequent and more costly economic shocks”. The Treasury also cites ” damage to global supply chains affecting trade, reduced production in trading partner nations pushing up the cost of imported goods, and changes to migration. “The true cost of a warmer climate to the UK economy could be higher than current estimates,” it admits.

And with cases soaring, immunity waning and a new Delta iant in the UK, an expert warned curbs may . Professor Neil Ferguson said: “It’s ­critical we accelerate boosters. A Plan B may need to be implemented, which involves rolling back some measures.” Brits face another winter of Covid restrictions unless ­boosters and children’s jabs are urgently ramped up, an expert warned today. Professor Ferguson fears delays in the roll-out of third ­injections, along with waning immunity and soaring cases could spark a deadly spike.Have your say on the booster rollout in the comment section And he revealed a “Plan B” of limited curbs may be needed.An NHS chief blamed the public for being too slow to respond to invites for boosters, but grieving families who have lost loved ones accused Boris Johnson of having “no plan” to prevent another surge.It comes as the UK today recorded its highest daily death toll since March, with  more fatalities and , cases. And a new Delta Plus iant was detected here that is behind a growing number of infections.  As some vaccination centres today stood empty, SAGE modeller Prof Ferguson said: “I do think it’s critical we accelerate the booster programme. Infection rates are highest in teenagers and most other European countries are ahead of us in vaccinating teenagers. “I’d like to see boosters accelerated, vaccination for teenagers accelerated. “We were very successful in getting vaccination rolled out early and we know immunity wanes over time, so we are now a bit more vulnerable. “I don’t think we’re looking at another lockdown. The worst case is demands on the NHS. It’s unlikely we’ll see anything like the deaths of last year. Coming into the winter, there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented, which involves some rolling back of measures.”  Former No chief scientic adviser Sir David King the pace of the booster rollout was going “extremely slowly”. NHS England chief ­executive Amanda Pritchard insisted there is “no delay” in sending out booster invitations. But she added: “Whilst it’s great people are coming forward for their boosters, they are not coming forward as quickly as we saw for the first jabs.” A publicity blitz is planned for this week, with radio and TV adverts urging people to go for both boosters and flu vaccines.  But Lobby Akinnola, of the Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice group, said: “The UK now has the highest rate of cases in the world as we once again head into winter. Once again, the Government ­seemingly has no plans to prevent further loss and has done little to learn from our pain. “How can they say they’ve done all they can to save lives ”  Get the latest news direct to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters From half-term, kids aged  to  can use the national booking service to secure jabs rather than waiting for an NHS invite.

James Bowen, of education union NAHT, said: “The Government cannot just sit back and accept the growing numbers of cases amongst children. “Staff are affected too. Many schools are struggling to stay open with increasing numbers of teachers and support staff testing positive.”  Many other illnesses are also ­circulating because of low levels of natural immunity after lockdowns.

Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru will call on the Prime Minister to give Cardf Bay responsibility for the nation’s Crown Estate land - meaning it can reap the benefits when energy firms build wind farms off the coast. Plaid’s Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts is expected to issue the demand when she tackles the Conservative premier at Prime Minister’s Questions at noon.

Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “While the UK and Scottish Government reap the benefits of a green gold rush, Wales is missing out,” she told the Mirror. “COP must put people at the heart of our net zero mission. “But currently, the people of Wales are losing out on the clean energy revolution while Westminster reaps the benefits. “Today I will call on the Prime Minister to support my Crown Estate Devolution Bill, which will ensure that profits from our natural resources go to the people of Wales, not Westminster.” The Crown Estate, which manages land on behalf of the Queen, owns the seabed to a distance of  nautical miles off the coast.  It leases seabeds for offshore wind developments to generate renewable energy and pump funds into the Treasury. The Crown Estate pays its profits to the Treasury, which normally hands % to Buckingham Palace through the Sovereign Grant. In February, the Crown Estate announced six proposed new offshore wind projects in the waters around England and Wales, including one north east of Anglesey. The , megawatt wind farm could power nearly . million homes and potentially cut carbon emissions by .m tonnes. The Crown Estate’s five-page “Wales Highlights  ” document says: “As a result of Offshore Wind Leasing Round  the valuation of our marine portfolio in Wales has increased signicantly in the year from £. million to £. million.” Ms Saville Roberts wants that money to go to Wales.  She said: “For too long, the UKaposs economy has left people behind while wealth and investment has been concentrated in the South East of England. “Our clean energy revolution must not continue to leave Wales out in the cold. “Devolving powers over the Crown Estate would bring half a billion pounds of green assets under Welsh control. “This will help ensure that it is the people of Wales who benefit from this historic opportunity to create a greener future. “Much will be said about ‘levelling up’ in the coming weeksthat is to mean anything, the people of Wales must be equipped to manage our offshore wind and tidal resources for everyone’s benefit.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TreasuryCrown EstateThe CrownPoliticsGoldRenewable ResourcesPlaid Cymru\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some , cases were recorded yesterday - up % in a week. Deaths have risen % to  in a week while weekly hospitalisations are up % to ,. SAGE member Prof Neil Ferguson, an architect of lockdown, warned: “Coming into the winter, there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented, which involves some rolling back of measures. But I doubt that we’ll ever get close to lockdown we were in January of this year.” Plan A includes booster jabs for the over-s and other vulnerable groups, offering a first dose to  to -year-olds and advice to wear masks in enclosed spaces. But no one mentioned Plan B at today’s Cabinet meeting, and the Prime Minister told his ministers hospitalisations and deaths are “broadly flat”. “Although we face a dficult winter we have a plan in place to steer the country through this period,” the bullish Tory leader claimed.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter - and join the debate in the comments below. At the same time, however, the government has today announced kids aged  to  will be able to get their Covid vaccines from walk-in centres rather than just in school. There are fears the rollout is too slow. As of October , .million under-s had received their first dose in England, out of an estimated .million people aged  to . Andthe rising case numbers aren’t turned around, No is not ruling out Plan B. “We’ve started to see some indications that hospitalisations and death rates are increasing,” the PM’s spokesman said. “Clearly we’re keeping a very close eye on rising case rates.” We don’t know when Plan B would be introduced - or whether it could happen before Christmas. In the words of No, “we would only look to use thatthe pressure on the NHS was looking to become unsustainable.” But we do know a bit about what it would involve and what factors would be used to trigger it. We also know it would apply to England, not Scotland or Wales. Here’s what you need to know.Mandatory masks- including in schoolsMinisters axed the legal requirement to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces in July. Instead they are a ‘condition of carriage’ on some transport - a weaker set of rules. But compulsory masks for places like shops and public transport - and fines from police - could the Covid situation deteriorates. The -page Autumn and Winter Plan states: If Plan B is implemented, the Government will bring back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. The precise settings will be decided at the time. Separately, schools have been handed a “contingency framework” for what to dothe virus surges, and a key plank is ing to compulsory masks in secondary classrooms. Scotland has already done this, and announced masks will continue after October half-term. Schools in England could also have to separate pupils back into ‘bubbles’ - though not with whole-class isolationone child gets sick - and must maintain regular cleaning and ventilation. Mandatory vaccine passports for venuesAfter a string of Tory U-turns over vaccine passports, they are now firmly in reserve for Plan B - and could be activated at a week’s notice. Currently venues are ‘encouraged’ to ask for NHS Covid passes, which allow punters to present proof of a vaccine or recent negative test, but hardly any venues are doing it. Under Plan B, certain venues would be forced to ask punters for an NHS Covid pass - and only the vaccine part would be valid. People would no longer be able to show a negative test. A consultation is under way about which venues would have to roll out the scheme. But in draft plans they include all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. They also include:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions. Outdoor, crowded settings with , or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as outdoor festivals. Any settings with , or more attendees, such as large sports and music stadia.Working from homeUnder plan B the government “would consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. But this is a long way from a lockdown-style order to WFH - and it looks almost like a Plan C. That is despite government advisors pointing out it drastically reduces the numbers of people mixing in offices and on public transport. The document states: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions, so a final decision would be made based on the data at the time.  ‘Clear communications’This is where Plan B gets even vaguer. It says the government would ensure it “communicates clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously.” It adds: “In a Plan B scenario, the Government would issue clear guidance and communications to the public and businesses, setting out the steps that they should take to manage the increased risks of the virus.” Cases are at , a day, but we’ve not yet heard any fresh communications in recent days.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

What would trigger Plan B Key questions the government would ask include: Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed  This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions. The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital. Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme. The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Could it go further Yes. Some have warned the Plan B measures above are pretty minimal overall. In particular,cases rise too high, you might need much stricter measures to actually bring cases down, rather than keep them stable or rising more slowly. The Plan B document says: “While the Government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees. “The Government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort.” Comment MORE ON CabinetConservative PartyNHSBoris JohnsonEducationHospitalsSchoolsPublic transportPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A woman aged  and a boy aged  are being treated in Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and a man aged  is being treated in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. An -year-old boy is being treated in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Two houses appeared to have been completely destroyed in the blast in Gorse Park, Ayr, South Ayrshire. Aerial images show debris strewn around the blast site with the roof of a neighbouring house caved in. Emergency services remained on the scene this morning after the blast, which happened at around .pm yesterday.  Chief Inspector Derrick Johnston, area commander for South Ayrshire, said: Police received a report of an explosion at Gorse Park in the KIncaidston area of Ayr around .pm last night. Emergency services attended and a number of houses were evacuated. A family of four were taken to hospital. A -year-old woman and a -year-old boy are currently within Glasgow Royal Infirmary. A -year-old male is currently within Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and an -year-old is within the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. This is a complex incident and dferent agencies are working together to establish he full circumstances of what happened. Our thoughts are with the family and everyone in the local community affected by this.  A joint investigation with Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is being carried out.A neighbour, who works in the gas industry, told how he saw hero nurses and a first aider running to the scene, Daily Record reports.He said: “I was standing at the back door, getting ready to take my dog out when I heard this massive explosion. “There were big white flashes which is what happens when there’s a large concentration of gas. “The back door flew open so I ran round to see what had happened and the place was just covered in debris. “It’s quite a confined square where the properties are so an explosion like that just channelled the power all down into dferent streets.  “I was telling people to stay away. Someone was trying to get a water hose but you can’t do that. “There’s quite a few nurses that live in this area because the hospital is close by so I saw them all come running to help. There’s also a first aider who ran across to try and help. “There was just so much noise and commotion. You couldn’t really hear or tellanyone was in there. “I know one of the people who lives in one of the attached houses and looking at it, it’s going to be condemned. “I could see flames coming from where the boiler would’ve been. They’re normally in the centre of these properties and they’re surrounded by brick. “Gas is heavier than air so it would’ve built up within the house. It’s actually blown the top of the house off and totally shredded it. “It’s a row of terraced houses so they’re all attached internally from wall to wall. So the stress ripped through the neighbouring houses too. “The sides have come off and the inside has all fallen down. “Some of the other properties within that square have PVC front doors and windows.

He was recently diagnosed as having Irlen Syndrome, which causes dficulties with fine vision tasks such as reading and can also cause co-ordination problems. James was diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum when he was just three-and-a-half years old, his mum Kirsty said.Myself and my husband noticed there was something niggly at two years old, but we werenapost sureit was because we were looking into it too much orit was genuinely something, Kirsty told YorkshireLive . But one of the nurses at Jamesapos two-year health check agreed that there could be something worth investigating and he was officially diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum  months later. Around the same time as he was given that diagnosis, Jamesaposs parents were told that it was likely he had a form of ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - but it was not until James was seven that he was formally diagnosed with autism. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Mum-of-two Kirsty said: I think it was more of a relief to know that we werenapost going insane and then we could at least make the strategies that we knew would work. And it gives us the ability to have the answershe does ask, heaposs not so far buthe does ask us aposwhy am I thinking dferently apos we can tell him. James was also more recently diagnosed as having Irlen Syndrome. Kirsty explained: He always struggled to read from a young age and we couldnapost grasp why. It wasnapost until one day I said to him aposyouaposre struggling to read, I donapost understand whyapos and he said aposbut the letters are moving everywhereapos and I was like aposWHAT !apos We just took him for an eye test and went with it, whenever something has cropped up we have just thought aposright lets see whataposs going on here thenapos. Luckily, Jamesaposs optician was able to kit him out with some special tinted glasses which help him to focus on the letters when he is reading - a similar fix to using coloured paper for dyslexia. Itaposs very much along the dyslexia lines, but I didnapost have a clue about it when I took him for the test, Kirsty said. For James, socialising with his peers is what he struggles with the most and there are times where it can be dficult for him to relate to his friends. James does not enjoy taking part in Christmas plays or concerts, unlike his school friends who relish the excitement of these festive celebrations. But there has been one thing that helped James to conquer this - his trusty drum kit. Kirsty said: Heaposs not a stage person, so Christmas concerts and stuff like that he doesnapost enjoy but, with this, he will actually get up and sit and play his drums. This remarkable turnaround is thanks to the local arm of a national music school, which has allowed James to get involved in his very own School of Rock and enjoy playing in a band with other children his age. Rocksteady, the countryaposs largest independent music school for children aged  -, went to Jamesaposs school to do some taster music lessons. He had the opportunity to sign up for more lessonshe liked them and the rest is history. After that he just enjoyed it and he carried on going and heaposs been going for years, Kirsty said, adding that it has made a world of dference not just to Jamesaposs social skills but his confidence, too. She continued: I think itaposs that thing where he can just be in the moment of the drums. Rocksteady is like a bit of a band and itaposs almost like heaposs in a band with people that he usually wouldnapost be in a band with, so heaposs talking to people he wouldnapost usually talk to. Kirsty and her husband have never allowed Jamesaposs diagnoses to stop him from having the same opportunities as other children and have always encouraged him to do aposeverydayapos tasks, despite these being a challenge at times. Kirsty said: I donapost think he particularly understands it yet and I think as he gets older he will, but he never refers to himself as being dferent. Weaposve always pushed to make him do things that everyone  does and things other kids would be doing.

The court, where the trial is ongoing, had previously heard that Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, , was once recorded sobbing: “No one loves me.” Birmingham City fan Arthur was found unresponsive at a home in Cranmore Road, Birmingham, on June  last year, Birmingham Live reported . He would die the following day at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. A post-mortem examination confirmed his death was caused by a head injury. Arthur’s father, Thomas Hughes, , and Emma Tustin, , were subsequently arrested in connection with his death.  They have both pleaded not guilty to murder and Tustin has admitted to one count of child cruelty but denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denied child cruelty offences. The trial is being held at Coventry Crown Court and recordings of Arthur crying and calling for his nanny and uncle have been played. Yesterday, October , medical expert Professor Stavros Stios was called to give evidence. He said The bleeding I saw in Arthuraposs case was in multiple dferent sites relating to his brain In Arthuraposs case the appearance of bleeding is more in keeping with shaking than impact. Today, October , Dr Roger Malcomson, consultant paediatric and perinatal pathologist, was called to give evidence on some of the injuries suffered by Arthur. He spoke about how Arthur’s thymus, an organ in the immune system in the chest, had shrunk severely. Dr Malcomson said this could have been the result of “repeated and sustained abuse”. He also said the pattern of bruising on the six-year-old’s body was “consistent with inflicted injuries.” Arthur also suffered from considerable bleeding within the eyes which led to the detachment of a retina and can be indicative of head trauma, the court was told.

Cllr Davies said: His whole garden and garden umbrellas, and he were all covered. Aeroplane toilets store passengersapos waste in special tanks and are normally emptied once the plane has landed. She told the forum: I know a number of incidents happen every year with frozen sewage from planes, but this wasnapost frozen and his whole garden was splattered in a very unpleasant way.  He was out in the garden at the time, so a really horrible, horrible experience. She added: Hopefully it never happens again to any of our residents. John Bowden, the councillor for Eton and Castle - covering Windsor Castle - called it a one in a billion chance.He suggested the warm weather meant the excrement could have come out as a more fluidy item.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Whitfield parish councillor Geoff Paxton, who has worked at airports for  years, said what happened was very rare and one he had not seen in a long time. He said: We used to have problems with blue iceon arrivals but that was because those toilets used to leak. He went on to explain that vacuum toilets in modern aircraft were much more secure. However,planes were below ,ft, as they would be when landing and taking off, the air pressure was less and it could well be that something came out of the vent at low altitude. Windsor resident Andrew Hall, who was present at the virtual meeting, said water companies were fined millions when discharging sewage into rivers. He added: When an aircraft dispatches it onto peopleaposs heads I think thataposs more heinous, frankly. Cllr Davies said the resident had decided not to pursue an insurance claim. The name of the airline has not been revealed though she said it was based a very long way away from here. She added that the resident contacted the airline, which denied its plane was in the area, but later confirmed it when the resident was able to identy the aircraft via a route tracking app. The Civil Aviation Authority has been contacted for comment.

However the -year-old has had the last laugh after making millions in software, construction and property firms. He now lives in a lavish mansion in Bretby, Derbyshire, and his le could not be more dferent from his early days on aposthe estateapos. Do you have a story youaposd like us to feature  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorThe dad of four said: I grew up in a village in Leicestershire called Thornton on what was referred to as aposthe estateapos - which was completely separate from the rest of the village in so many ways. You were from aposup the villageapos or aposdown the estateapos. A lot of people didnapost work and that was the environment I grew up in. There was violence too - people would beat each other up for no reason. I managed to get myself out of a lot of scrapes because I was a quick runner, but there were times when Iaposd get trapped and beaten up. I was always looking over my shoulder. Looking back, thataposs actually made me mentally sharp and aware.  Mark lived with his parents and three sisters - twins  years older than him and another seven years his senior. His dad, James - who tragically died following an illness in  - worked as a builder and a taxi driver. Mark, who now lives in a multi-million-pound property in Bretby, said: My sisters always looked after me, but when you donapost have much money, you have to rely on your siblingsapos hand-me-downs. Iaposd be wearing girlsapos jeans and trying to make them look like they were boysapos.  I even had to take on my sisteraposs pink trainers. I used bitumen from my dadaposs building site to make them black. One day, I remember I was playing football and it was wet, so the bitumen started coming off, revealing the pink colour beneath. The boys mocked me, shouting, aposYouaposre wearing girlsapos shoesapos. My mum used to scrimp and save every penny - going to the toilet in the dark to save electricity and washing disposable sandwich bags so they could be reused. Everything she saved, though, my dad would take to the pub and **** up the wall. Bad as it seemed at the time, these things were actually my inspirations - they made me realise I didnapost want to be worrying about whether somethingaposs p or p before I bought it.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter That meant I was always driven to make money. I was washing cars when I wasnapost big enough to lt the bucket and working on a building site with my dad in my teens. Mark now has more wealth than most people would ever dream of. He lives in a huge home with we Nikola, , and is father to daughters Freya, three Sienna-Rose, six and Courtney,  - as well as infant son Theo. And he says a key reason he has got to where he is today is the fact he always kept faith things would work out. He said: I always had a feeling inside there had to be more to le. Iaposd even put vouchers and Monopoly money in my pockets when I went out to have that feeling of having cash in my pockets. When I was , I decided to go it alone and start a construction business, but in , the global financial crash happened.  There was no work and it was incredibly tough being a self-employed -year-old - then Courtney came along and I just thought aposIaposve got to do somethingapos. I did everything I could to make money - even selling door to door - and ended up somehow getting a job with an IT company. I knew nothing about IT, but thataposs how I got into software, which is where it all began. Markaposs hard work began to pay off - he became the companyaposs leading salesman and was promoted to become head of sales. Then came an opportunity to become a partner in his ex-colleagueaposs software company. Mark said: That really was a game-changer for me. We did £. million of sales in  months, turning round what had been a struggling company losing money every month.  Thataposs where I started to get into training people and realised that business is people - when I helped others to become better versions of themselves, the company won. With his new-found wealth, Mark was able to invest in property and, from , within  months, he had established a portfolio worth £. million. Now, his property firm, Harvey Property Solutions, has done £ million of deals. The other side of Markaposs business world is his Real Le group, which has companies across sectors, including in construction and training. It also boasts a foundation training children how to deal with le issues, including building relationships and communication.  Mark says he wants to use the brand to help create a more harmonious civilization. He said: I like helping people to transform their lives. I wanted to create a business where staff want to help the business grow because it helps them. I want people to want to go to work. I grew up always hearing. aposOh no - itaposs Monday againapos. But in our property training ision, weaposve helped create  millionaires.  Not everyone has to be a believer, but they should know they can create a le where they are comfortable enough and have the resources to deal with it when things get really tough. If I can do it with some of the things Iaposve come up against, then many other people already have a head-start. Iaposm always drawn to people who need help and want to know whether they, deep down, want to help themselves.

The uni should help students to stay safeand report incidents without insensitively blaming victims.  All guilt lies with perpetrators - the primary focus must be on them. Students at other universities have also expressed their fury. Fran Heald, a Leeds University student, said: The tweet said aposdonapost get spikedapos and I understand what they were trying to do, as there are things you can do to avoid it.

Throughout October, the Mirror is Celebrating Black Britain - by highlighting every day the outstanding achievements and contributions Black Britons have made to this country. And today we explore some of the everyday items used in households across the world that were invented by Black people from as early as the th century. In some cases inventors failed to patent their creations which allowed others to swoop in and claim it as their own brainwave. Here we have listed some of the  everyday items created by Black inventors.  Blood banks Charles Richard Drew, an African American surgeon and medical researcher, is credited for his pioneering work with blood storage and transfusions. At the beginning of World War II he was the brains behind large scale blood banks that saved the lives of thousands of soldiers. He used mobile trucks with refrigerators to transport blood where it was needed. He also made sure all blood plasma was tested before it was shipped out and only skilled people could carry out transfusions to avoid cross contamination.  Hair straightener Madam C.J. Walker became the richest African American women of her time thanks to her work with hair inventions. Born into poverty, the entrepreneur, philanthropist, and activist invented a comb that would straighten curly hair.  She was created a rang of hair products which she meant she was worth a whopping million when she died in . Straightening combs have since evolved and are now more commonly known as hair straighteners.  Rolling pin Itaposs a staple in most kitchens and a must have for pastry chefs thanks to John W Reed, who invented the rolling pin. Late in the nineteenth century he patented the rolling pin as we know it today which has two handles connected to a centre rod. He realised by designing it this way it meant pastry could be successfully rolled out without cooks putting their hands on the rolling surface. Mr Reed also adapted more updated versions of a dough kneader. Traffic lights African American Garrett Morgan patented the three-position traffic light system in  which is still being used today. The son of two slaves noticed the traffic signals being used at the time had red for stop and green for go with no interval in between. He is said to have got to work after he noticed an accident at a problematic intersection and created the three signal system which includes an amber light. He later sold the rights to his invention to General Electric for ,. Gas mask Garrett Morgan is also the brains behind a smoke hood which later became a gas mask. The hood he patented in  was a clear airtight bag placed over the head which has an air filter held in the mouth which the wearer used to breathe. His invention was used in a tunnel construction disaster rescue in Cleveland which took place in . The smoke hood became the prototype and precursor for the gas masks used during World War I.  Wringing mop Thomas W. Stewart patented a new type of mop in  that made cleaning floors much easier. His clamping device could wring water out of a mop by using a lever. He first designed a mop head that could be removed by unscrewing it from the base of the handle and replacing it with a new one. Then he created a lever attached to the mop head which would wring water from the head without the user getting their hands wet.The UK began celebrating Black History Month, an idea first spawned in the United States and then also adopted by European countries including Ireland and the Netherlands, in October . Black History Month helps give context to modern le and the countryaposs history, while championing the experiences and celebrating the contributions of Black Britons here in the UK. The observation was first organised through the leadership of Ghanaian-born analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. He served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council. Consequently, Akyaaba created a plan aiming to recognise the contributions of African, Asian and Caribbean people to the economic, cultural and political le in the UK. Door knob Itaposs dficult to think of a world without a door knob but before Osbourn Dorsey patented the creation we use today people used a dferent method. Only the wealthy were able to lock their doors, and until the African American inventor thought up the idea used today most had a latch-string device to keep their doors closed. He also created the doorstop and applied for a patent for both inventions in December . He was just  when his idea literally changed the world.  Lemon squeezer John Thomas White received a patent for a better way of squeezing lemons in . His invention allows us to obtain the citrus juice while keeping our hands clean. The earliest method of squeezing lemons dates back to the s. But the method we use today was created by the African American inventor. Fire sprinkler systemThomas J Marshall is credited with inventing the sprinkler system used in large buildings and businesses to effectively put out fires. In  he patented his idea which enables water to be pumped through pipes throughout the building. It came into use in the US two years later. Since , new buildings constructed in England taller than  metres must have a sprinkler system fitted.  Ice cream scoop Businessman Alfred L. Cralle invented the ice cream scoop. In  he applied for a patent on his invention which was a built-in scraper that allowed ice cream to be scooped with one hand. His creation was originally called the Ice Cream Mold and Disher and was designed to keep ice cream and other foods from sticking. He is claimed to have come up with the idea after he noticed ice cream servers were struggling to put large chunks on to a cone. There are many more inventions that were created by black people - this is just the tip of the iceberg. Refrigerated trucks Frederick McKinley Jones co-founded Thermo King and is credited for his innovations in refrigeration. The award-winning African American inventor and entrepreneur designed a portable air-cooling unit for trucks carrying perishable food in  and patented it two years later. He is self-taught in mechanical and electrical engineering. Mr Jones received more than  patents for refrigeration technologies and other advances including X-ray machines, engines and sound equipment during his career.

Alex Craig helped the -year-old boy and checked his wounds before the youngster was then rushed to hospital for emergency help. Helped by four other neighbours, Alex immediately ran towards the danger after the huge blast in Ayr on Monday evening.He and other friends dug the -year-old boy from the blast zone and took him to his home just  yards away, the Daily Record reports. His intervention came so soon after the blast that he had no idea how many other people,any, were still under the rubble. Alex and his stunned partner Vicky decided to head straight for hospital after being urged to do so by the first ambulance driver to arrive on the scene.  Alex said: “I was out the back when I heard the blast and it sounded like a bomb had landed. “I was shocked but I guess I instinctively ran towards the biggest wreckage because it was obvious that people would be caught in the blast and could be in the wreckage. “There was still dust and debris flying around the air but I got to the main heap of rubble and I could see a [boy] lying there, covered in debris. “By this time a few other local guys had come out, same as me, and we started digging him out.  “It looked like his arm was badly broken and he couldn’t see because he had all the dust in his face and his lungs. “I took him into my own house and my partner tried to make sure he didn’t have any catastrophic wounds. “It was hard to see what was happening because the wee boy’s pyjamas had melted to his skin. “My partner has luckily just finished a first aid course and she knew what to do, so she cleaned him up and we asked him questions about his name and where he lived and what school he went to, just to make sure he was alert and not concussed.” Alex and Vicky handed the boy over to his brother in law James and his partner Stephanie. Alex said: “We asked whether or not we should do the run to hospital and the police and ambulance guys who were there said just to go as fast as we could . They said that staff at Crosshouse Hospital would be told we were coming and to be ready for us. “The wee boy was awake and he was asking where his parents were and I think he was confused. He’d have been traumatised about being rushed to hospital but it was important to get him there as soon as possible.” While the youngster was being rushed to hospital, Alex ed to the scene to watch his parents and brother being taken out of the remains of their home.  He said: “I was still in a total state of shock and unable to take in what was happening but I was just hoping and hoping that they will all pull through this. “If you heard the sound of the explosion and saw the aftermath you would not believe that anyone could survive. We are just praying that there is good news.” The -year-old neighbour of the family was lucky to avoid injury. Betty Campbell and daughter Sandra, , were helped out of a window that had been blown out in the blast.  Betty and Sandra were taken to the home of family members to take refuge, wondering when they will be allowed back home.Her niece Allana Rennie posted on Facebook : “I’m so overwhelmed with everyone’s help I can hardly type for tears.“Thankfully Granny Betty and Aunty Sandra escaped with their lives and have nothing but the clothes on their back.” Allana appealed for friends to donate emergency clothes for the pair and was inundated with the response. Local people reported a strong smell of gas at Gorse Park prior to the blast. Gary Burgess, , said: “The smell of gas on Monday was so strong when I went for my morning paper. People were talking about it and you’re always thinking at the back of your mind there could be an explosion. “When the blast happened I was sure that a lorry had driven into the side of my house, which is  yards down the road from Gorse Park. He added: “All I can say right now is that I hope those involved in the blast get through it. But there needs to be an inquiry to get to the bottom of how it happened.” Comment MORE ON Rescue\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But after the events that happened after a women’s vigil, I know now I’ll never lose my fire to protect women from male violence. Reclaim These Streets Hull is a group that organises vigils in the centre of Hull City Centre. We led our second vigil last Saturday . We showed the names of around  women who had died at the hands of male violence collected from Counting Dead Women. We then held a two-minute silence to honour them and to shine a light on misogyny in our society. My mum and sister, once I had said my goodbyes, walked with me to Paragon Station so I could get my bus home safely. Once in the brightly lit station, crowded with people due to a local fair taking place, we sat down opposite my bus bay and waited.  It wasn’t before long that a man who was sitting on a seat next to us interjected. “Where do you live ” he asked me. I lied and said a village on my bus route. “Where ” I repeated myself. “No, where [in the village] ” It had been  minutes since I had left the vigil on women’s safety before I was being harassed by a man. A man who thought he was entitled to know where I lived… in great detail. I refused to tell him hoping that would be an end to it. However, for the next five minutes, he continued to ask me where I lived, specically where in my village. Seeing my sister was uncomfortable, I made our excuses to get a cuppa from the Greggs shop slightly further up. We stood in the store for a little while when one of the staff askedwe were okay. When I explained what was happening, they called security. My sister then said to me and my mum: “He’s just walked past the shop…” I looked but couldn’t see him. The man then walked into the Greggs store, glancing at us as we walked to the other end of the shop. He had not only looked for us but had found us. I pointed him out to the staff members discreetly and the supervisor walked us to the bus bay. Once security came over, they waited with me until I got my bus. So a happy ending right  Everyone was safe, nobody was harmed…  Except we were harmed psychologically. When one man decides to act on his entitlement, it starts off a chain reaction. Not only were my mum and sister anxious walking back to their car at .pm, but in their panic they had forgotten to pay their parking fees . My partner came to collect me from a bus station halfway home. He was anxious about my safety. We decided to stay at his instead of mine to put our mental state more at ease. And me  I was more shocked at finding out that my stalker wasn’t the only one in the station Greggs staff had helped a lady weeks before who had become distraught over someone following and harassing her in the station. A couple of days later I found out other vigil attendees had been sexually harassed and even assaulted just minutes after the vigil ended on their way home. A collective of women who fear victim-blaming by police, lack of evidence on CCTVand the potential of it happening again. Within half an hour, six women had been harassed by at least one man. How many were harassed in one night  In  hours  So for anyone who thinks misogyny or male entitlement isn’t present in our society, please remember this story. For those who try to put us off standing our ground, please know we’ll never stop protecting our freedom to be safe on our streets and in our homes.

Ahead of Daryll and Carey Leslie’s wedding in September of , the couple spent a day hand making each otheraposs rings. But the gold band, which Daryll, , had treasured, slipped off when he went for a dip with a pal on a beach at the Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, early last month. He only spent  minutes in the water but due to a condition, Raynaudaposs, which restricts blood flow in cold water, the ring slipped off. Carey, , who works as a le skills coordinator, was away on a spa weekend with friends when the ring went missing - so Daryll initially pretended nothing had happened. He eventually told her when he realised the likelihood of getting the band back was low, he said.  Daryll used social media to try to track down the ring - which was found by Stephen MacLeod, , who lives on the island. Stephen arranged for it to be delivered in person in Edinburgh to the couple, with the special parcel coincidentally arriving back in Daryll’s hands on their second wedding anniversary. Daryll, an interior designer, said he and his pal had been swimming in a “beautul” little cove on the island when the tragedy struck. As we were walking back to the car, I realised I didnapost have my wedding ring,” he recalled. My fingers shrink in the cold. I looked at my hand and I was gutted.”  While he said it was “kind of a material thing”, it was important to him because he and Carey had made the bands for one another. Itaposs not easily replaceable,” he said. Itaposs not like I could go into H. Samuel to pick another one out. Carey messaged me asking how are things and I said aposGreat, couldnapost be better. The search was aided by the relatively small area in which Daryll and his mate had been swimming - the dip had been limited to a part of the bay hemmed in by rocks at high tide. Daryll said the pair had “a rectangle” they knew they didn’t venture out of.  We knew we didnapost go past those rocks on either side so we could narrow it down slightly,” he said. If it had just been on the beach there would be no way we could have found it. Painter and decorator Stephen thought it was unlikely he would manage to find the lost ring when he went out with a friend. He typically stuck to fields when searching for treasure, he said, digging up items like old coins. Stephen said: We were looking for over an hour and there was nothing happening.I thought it was long gone, even while we were looking, we didnapost really expect to find it. Once I got the signal, it came up on my machine saying it had found gold and I knew straight away before I started digging that was it.” Stephen was shocked, as he said he’d thought the tide would have taken the band out to sea. Locating the treasured item was an “amazing feeling”, he said. Daryll now planned to send the ring to a jeweller, to be resized to avoid it slipping off again. Daryll said: It was a nice surprise and we hadnapost even planned it. Carey said she had “obviously” been disappointed upon hearing the wedding band had been lost, but said she “knew there was no point in me giving him a hard time”. I didnapost think there was any chance we would get it back,” she said. I was really over the moon when it was found because I knew Daryll would be so happy. What a lovely thing to do, to go out and look for someone you donapost know.

Pensioner Mr Frost, who has dementia, was taken to Scunthorpe General hospital after falling and fracturing his hip. His family were assured staff were qualied to manage his dementia when they called at around pm.But they said they were horried to learn he was still waiting for a bed on a trolley in the hallway the following morning- more than  hours later, Grimsby Live. His son, Andrew Frost, claims he was also told that staff had not offered him any food or drink because he appeared “aggressive” and agitated. By .am, his father was finally in a bed.  But when his family visited later that day, they claim they found him hungry, thirsty and in pain. He couldnapost reach water that was placed nearby because of his hip fractures. Andrew was told that records of his fatheraposs medical care in AE werenapost available, meaning that discharge nurses were unable to offer him any pain relief, it is claimed. His care home was also reluctant to accept him back without proper documentation, the family add. He eventually ed home around pm on Saturday, where he “ate like someone who hadn’t been fed for two days.” Andrew said he was disgusted by what his father went through. “I was furious at his treatment. It is very emotional to see a relative have that sort of treatment, especially someone who is now a frail elderly man,” he said.  “He was distressed the whole time he was there. “The fact there didn’t seem to be any documentation made his experience more infuriating than it needed to be. “The care home staff told us that when he got back, he ate the cupboards bare. “I would like the hospital to look at the way he was treated and make sure it isn’t repeated so that his suffering isn’t in vain.” Jo Loughborough, Lead Nurse for Patient Experience, apologised and said the trust aimed to provide better service even when AE was very busy. “I am sincerely sorry to hear about the experience Mr Frost and his family had. Our staff are working extremely hard under enormous pressure and whilst we are experiencing very high attendance numbers in our AE departments, as a Trust our expectation is that we ensure we continue to offer the best care possible to our patients and their families, she said.

Her comments came during a High Court hearing on TuesdayActivists from Insulate Britain blocked a junction near the Dartford Crossing in Thurrock on October  Image: Getty ImagesByTom PilgrimChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct National Highways should reduce motorway speed limits to mph during Insulate Britain protests, a member of the campaign group told the High Court. Dr Diana Warner, a member of the Extinction Rebellion offshoot, demanded that the roads agency works with protesters to ensure safety for everyone amid its efforts to block traffic on major roads. Her comments came during a High Court hearing in which a judge extended an injunction granted to Transport for London against Insulate Britain. Earlier this month, TFL, Londonaposs transport network, was granted a civil banning order aimed at preventing protesters from obstructing traffic on some of the capitalaposs busiest roads. Members of Insulate Britain have also been made subject to three other injunctions granted to National Highways, banning demonstrations on the M, around the Port of Dover, and on major roads around London.  In the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Lavender extended the TfL injunction and granted permission for the list of named iniduals it covers to be amended. The judge said the injunction was extended either until a trial is held in the case or a further court order or April  next year. He added: This doesnapost rule out the possibility that it could be extended again by a judge on a further occasion. Last week, the court heard that National Highways may ask for a default or summary judgment - legal steps which would mean the case against the protesters is resolved without a trial.  Mr Justice Lavender also granted a request by TfLaposs barrister, Andrew Fraser-Urquhart QC, for further disclosure of information by the politan Police relating to arrests. During Tuesdayaposs hearing, Insulate Britain members were given the chance to address the court. Dr Warner, a retired GP, told the court that Insulate Britain is intent on keeping the public safe and committed to non-violence. The -year-old added that there is a wide gulf between her understanding of what constitutes safety and National Highwaysapos stance. Dr Warner said National Highways should slow the traffic to  miles per hour or  miles per hour when there are people on the motorway.  She also warned that she expects to continue Insulate Britainaposs campaign for civil resistance until a meaningful statement from the Government that we can trust. She said: Iaposm willing to give up my freedom and my house. These are all the material things I have. The woman added that there is everything to losewe destroy the Earth that sustains us. Last month, climate protesters wrote to National Highways calling for the speed limit to be reduced on the M ahead of a wave of blockades on the motorway. Breaching a court order can result in a committal for contempt of court, which,proved, may be punished with up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine. At Tuesdayaposs hearing, Mr Justice Lavender emphasised to those in court which injunctions are in place and encouraged people who find themselves served with a committal application to seek legal advice. At a High Court hearing held last week, the same judge extended the three National Highways injunctions. According to court documents from the earlier hearing,  people have been served with court orders related to the Insulate Britain protests.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Essex PoliceTransport for Londonpolitan PoliceInjunctionsExtinction Rebellion\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The UK Health Security Agency announced on Tuesday that AY.. is being monitored and assessed. The next stage would be for it to be designated a ‘iant under investigation’there is a strong suggestion its mutations make it more contagious. If it is shown to avoid immune protection built up from previous infection or vaccination it becomes a ‘iant of concern’. Prof Balloux added: “The AY.. is being closely monitored in the UK and where and remains rare outside the UK. “There have been only three cases detected in the US so far. In Denmark, the other country that besides the UK has excellent genomic surveillance in place, it reached a % frequency but has gone down since.” Downing Street insisted there was no evidence the iant spreads more easily.

A further  Covid deaths were recorded in the UK today - a seven-month high. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said there were “no plans” to use the contingency measures set out in the autumn winter strategy. “There are a number of dferent factors that would play into that decision,” the spokesman said. “Largely it would be required when there was a signicant risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. “We are not at that point.

The £ test is considered to be a valuable tool in the fight against Covid especially in regions where there are fewer vaccines available and also to help identy those most at risk.Scientists made a report on the test in medRxiv, an internet site distributing unpublished emprints about health sciences, and is operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.It has now been published in the journal Epidemiology and Infection. Genes that raise people’s risks of getting severe Covid are considered as well as people suffering from medical conditions that could have an impact like respiratory disorders.  Experts believe that the test has an accuracy of % in determining whether a person will be badly affected by Covid. An advantage of the test is also that it is easy to carry out with a person only required to spit into a tube and then the sample is sent to a laboratory. The study stated that: An accurate test to predict risk of severe COVID- can inform prioritization of vaccine doses to those most at risk and will be useful in regions in which vaccination is not widespread enough to provide herd immunity - either through unavailability or vaccine hesitancy -available vaccines are not effective against iants of SARS-CoV-, oravailable vaccines are not indicated for some people. On an inidual level, knowledge of personal risk can empower people to make informed choices about their day-to-day activities, including targeted social distancing in the workplace or other crowded places. It stated that a future point of research will be in why some people have had only minor symptoms originally but have suffered chronic disease The tests are currently available to order in the US and are believed to be coming soon to the UK.

The Pack Horse, which is in the Peak District village of Hayfield, was visited by a group who didnapost complain when staff came and checked on them after they got their food. Staff say that the group chose to complain once theyaposd eaten most of the meal.The group allegedly tried to ask for a new dish, which was refused, and eventually left without paying the bill, Manchester Evening News reports. Owner and chef Luke Payne said that one member of the group then had the nerve to wink at him as they left. Were the diners right to leave  Have your say in the comments  The pub takes card details at the time of booking in case of no-shows or walk-outs, but the group reportedly said they would cancel their cards. Luke said the ordeal was immensely frustrating for him and his staff. He said: They were perfectly pleasant to begin with and then everything just changed. After theyaposd eaten about  per cent of the food, a lady brought her plate up to the bar and said it wasnapost to her liking, wasnapost what she expected, and could she swap to another meal for free   To which I said aposNoapos, because sheaposd eaten most of it and we canapost give food away for free when itaposs just personal preference. Thataposs not really how it works. Luke said his small team had already checked in with the group of customers and there were no complaints made about their food. When the group threatened to not pay their bill, Luke said he told them: aposThataposs not really acceptable, youaposve eaten most it, and you were given the opportunity to say there was something wrong with it.apos  He added: If theyaposd flagged it up in the check-back we could have done something to recty it. We donapost actively like making people unhappy, itaposs our job for people to have a really good night. We love people leaving with a buzz and knowing theyaposve had a great time with us, and  per cent of the people we have in are absolutely lovely and have a great time. We put in so much effort and passion and love, so every negative comment is taken personally. We will always do our utmost to fix a problemsomething is wrong -weaposve made a mistake weaposll hold our hands up and weaposll own it. So in an instance where absolutely nothing is wrong and people have kicked off, it hurts. The Pack Horse is one of the North Westaposs leading and most respected gastropubs, earning itself a place in the Estrella Dam Gastropubs list. Luke says that business has been great since they were able to reopen their doors after lockdown, but he says the post-pandemic kindness is fading. He said: I feel like there was a point in the pandemic where everyone was like aposBe kind, be nice. But Iaposve certainly noticed over the last couple of weeks that thereaposs been more stressed-out people with shorter tempers, and I know that thereaposs a lot of hard times for people at the moment, but it doesnapost take much to be nice to others. It was such a great opportunity to have that societal reset but I think some people have slipped back into their old ways. Business has been great, weaposve been so thankful for all the support weaposve had and weaposve been practically full every single weekend.

Little Issy, three, and Evie, two, were not looked after as well as they could have been, Hampshire Adopting Agency Adopt South said. The girls love being out and seeing the world, playing with their dolls and are keen learners. They are currently living with a qualied and experienced foster carer who is used to looking after children in need of additional needs - but the pair need a family to have permanent security and care. Adopt South said that as a result of her le experiences, the eldest sister Issy can react in a way that seems younger than her age due to a delay in her development in her early years. At times, she can feel scared or confused as she cannot always work out what is the best thing to do. Adopt South says that during these times she can become scared or confused, or even angry, but is calmed and comforted with care and cuddles. Issyaposs foster carer added: Issy can be an adorable little girl, who has made amazing progress in the last year. She will spend hours talking and playing with her dolls, and pushing her pram around the house. Her favourite film is Disneyaposs Frozen. She needs a lot of comfort from a loving parent, or parents, who will have the time to soothe and help develop her confidence so she can flourish. Evie meanwhile is just at the stage of wanting to explore everything and enjoys spending time outside, playing with her foster parentaposs dogs and spending lots of time with other people who can read to and listen to her.  Adopt South said she also has dficulties expressing herself due to her early le experiences. Rachel Reynolds, head of Adopt South, said: Issy and Evie are lovely little girls who have been through experiences that most children their age would not have been exposed to, which makes them feel very vulnerable at times. The girls need a family le where their adoptive parent s will have an understanding or experience working or caring for children with additional needs - or within a community or faith where they are fully supported with family and friendship groups around them. Issy and Evie need the time, commitment and love to develop into happy and confident girls. Adopt South is committed to supporting the girls and their adoptive parent s throughout their childhood journey whenever they need it.

Rose said sheaposs “into Buddhism” and has been reflecting on the religion’s teachings that one should try to live le without regret, and is keen to find a job. The Oakwood woman hasn’t been following current affairs, instead using the lockdowns to serve as time of introspection to figure out what she really wants to do in le and how to achieve it.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  She said: “I guess I haven’t been paying attention to current affairs. I haven’t noticed. I’ve just been looking online and seeing how much money I have, ‘okay, I can work with that’. “This is the most financially secure I have ever been. I’ve never had a stable income of any kind. [In the past] I’ve just been doing odd jobs here and there, living with family.” Rose had been living in Israel prior to the pandemic “searching for like the meaning of le”. Not only did she work on a kibbutz, she spent her time doing lots of dferent odd-jobs like cleaning and factory work.  Rose was visiting the Aspire  Work centre in Leeds, next door to the jobcentre. She arrived “dressed for the job I want, not for what I have,” in a faux fur coat, scarlet head scarf, a choker necklace and polka-dot shirt. Rose says she was “excited” and determined to be making the next step in to finding a career. She has ambitions to become a psychologist but would be “happy to take a job at Tesco” at this point having struggled with her mental health for the past few years. “This is tax payer’s money, they don’t want to be paying for someone to have a free ride,” she admitted. “Le is just hard, that’s just a fact. It’s been hard in general, I never wanted to do this [receive benefits].” Reflecting on how she got to this point, she explained: “So many people have just complained about work and how work is so horrible. My whole le, I’ve heard that narrative and I think that’s really given me this belief that ‘work’s horrible and I really don’t want to do it’ - like why would you want to do something horrible   “At this point it’s about reprogramming my mind that work is an opportunity to meet my own needs – which is a strength – and so you can contribute something to the world, that’s also beneficial.” Universal Credit claimant Graham De’Ville, , has been receiving benefits for three months. He was previously a carer for his we but suffered a mental breakdown after they had a messy breakup.During his time on benefits, he’s volunteered with housing support service Engage Leeds. Asked about how he feels about the cut to Universal Credit, Graham said: “It’s the wrong time to do it, considering that food prices are going up for one, it’s going to send a lot of people in to poverty. “I’m in a lucky situation at the moment as I’m still with my mother but what would worry me is the gas and electric bills, food – all that would matter. Some people are living on £ or £ a week and it doesn’t cover it.” He added that he doesn’t trust the Government or even the Labour opposition party to manage the benefits system.

She wasn’t able to visit her doctor during the pandemic to identy the issue of her “stomach problems” and had to spend an extended period off work.Dawn says being out-of-work is “a bit boring”, especially since she had been consistently working for near  years. She said: “It’s been fairly straight-forward. The staff here are really nice, helpful. They’re helping me with my CV today.” Asked how she felt about families affected by the Universal Credit cut, she said: “It won’t be great for them, it’s sad. £ a week is a lot to lose.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the cut, insisting the taxpayer should not subsidise low wages through the benefits system and set out a vision for “high skill, high wage” economy.He told LBC Radio earlier this month: “What we won’t do is take more money in tax to subsidise low pay through the welfare system.”He added: “This Government is doing the dficult, long-term things.

TikTok star @my.data.not.yours uploaded a clip for her fans documenting all the information that the tech giant had collected about her. She said she put in a request but didnapost expect them to have too much, but was aposnot totally comfortableapos with what she discovered. It turned out that Amazon had her location, all her phone contacts, and thousands and thousands of recordings of her voice - collected from products that she gladly bought and placed in her home.  What do you think about the information Amazon collects  Let us know in the commentsIn the video, she said: I requested all the data that Amazon has on me, and hereaposs what I found. For reference, I have two dots and one echo, plus a few smart bulbs. She then opens a zip filed that had previously been downloaded and it contains many folders, which are titled aposAlertsapos, aposAnswersapos, aposAudio and Transitionapos, aposListsapos, aposRoutinesapos, aposShoppingapos, aposSkillsapos, and aposVideoapos, amongst others. She continued: I decided to click on the audio one and this is what they have. These are all short voice clips which is so scary and this is one of me turning on the light. There are  short audio clips in this folder alone. I then clicked on contacts and it turns out they have a full list of contacts from my phone and I never remember syncing that.

The very last thing that I didnapost know that they had, I could have assumed that they had, but I donapost love that they have, is my location. If you open up thishere it will show you where you are located, right down to the latitude and longitude. I am not totally comfortable with everything they have. The video soon had over . million views alongside , likes and over , comments - many of which were from concerned Amazon customers. One user said: The fact that you didnapost know all this is more of reflection on you than Amazon. And a second said: Itaposs scary that people with Echo Dots and Alexaaposs etc donapost know that Amazon records you and keeps the recordings. While a third joked: Can someone explain to me why this is aposscaryapos  Iaposm not interesting enough to carethey have my contacts or audio. A spokesperson for Amazon said: We give customers transparency and control over their Alexa experience. Customers can easily review and delete their voice recordings, or choose not to have them saved at all, at any time.Customers can import their mobile phone contacts to the Alexa app so they can use features like hands-free calling and messaging this optional feature, which customers need to set up, can be disabled at any time.Finally, you can grant permissions for the Alexa app to use certain data, such as your mobile device’s geolocation, to provide relevant results weather, traffic, restaurant recommendations, and you can manage these permissions in the app. Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Addison Cassel, @addisoncassel, posted a video on TikTok in which she explained she was laying on her bed in an unnamed motel when she noticed a cut in the carpet just under the bed.She said she got on the floor with her grandmother and lted up the piece of fabric to find a wooden board, and when they lted that up as well, they were shocked by what they saw. Underneath the bed seemed to be a hidden room, which was completely dark and empty except for several cobwebs. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Addison wrote in her clip: “I was on my motel bed and I noticed a cut out in the floor. “Me and my grandma got it open – there was two layers covering it. “There’s a room under our room! It’s a one story motel.” The woman then posted a part two in which she stuck her phone down the gap into the room – which is actually just a crawl space. The second clip shows there’s nothing to be frightened of inside the empty space, and the dust and cobwebs building up inside prove the space hasn’t been used by anybody in a long time. And in another video, Addison answered several questions she’d received since her clips were posted. The woman said she phoned the motel after she’d left to ask themthey had any more information about the space – but they were weirdly secretive about it. She explained: “I called today and the lady that picked up was really rude to me. “I asked her, I was like, ‘Hey I stayed in this room number and there was a crawl space underneath the bed. I’m pretty sure it was a crawl space – could you tell me anything about it ’ “And she just kept asking me why I wanted to know. She asked me  times before she said anything, and then she was like, ‘It’s just for pipes. Have a good day.’ “Why was she being so secretive about it  All I did was ask.” Addison’s videos have over  million views, and viewers couldnapost help but think up scary scenarios for what might be lurking in the space under the bed.  One person wrote: “I watched a movie once about a psycho motel owner that had underground tunnels to each room, and he’d butcher them in their sleep.” While another said: “I watched an episode of Criminal Minds once where a stalker did that and stayed under her bed for months to video tape everything that went on in her bed.” And a third added: “Okay well you know what’s in crawl spaces  Bodies. Bodies are in crawl spaces. I watch too many movies.” But others were unimpressed by the videos, insisting there was nothing to fear.

Typically filled with cured meats, cheese, fruit, bread, crackers and dips, theyaposre the perfect centrepiece for any get-together. But one womanaposs unique take on the trend has left people baffled. Home cook Karima thought it was a brilliant idea to serve huge portions of pasta on her kitchen side to skip out on the washing up. After covering her table with foil, a hefty amount of pasta is poured on top. She then loads on three dferent sauces - one of which appears to be a mushroom sauce, the next being a tomato sauce with slices of chicken, and finally a bolognese sauce, all of which end up merging together in a gloopy mess.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Karima shared the video on her TikTok, @karimaskollec, where she said: Yesterday’s dinner with the girlies!, and it quickly went viral. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , views, , likes and hundreds of comments from people who couldnapost decide it was genius or horrendous. One person said: Unnecessary. Another asked: Why not just put it in three big serving bowls, something classy   But theyaposre touching, complained someone . While a fourth wrote: My OCD is triggered. But some people were quick to defend the interesting method as one person put: Uhh the comment section ainapost it, they ainapost watching the nacho  loaded fry TikToks and it shows. Another tagged their friend and said: Now this is something that we need to do, as one person admitted: My mouth is watering. Previously, a man came under fire for his spaghetti and hot dog pasta dish.The man posted the recipe on the Rate My Plate group on Facebook where users quickly gave their opinion - and some went as far as to say that Bear Grylls wouldnapost eat that.In the picture was a bowl filled with plain spaghetti pasta that had been threaded through cut up pieces of hot dog.Click here to take a look for yourself.

Within seconds the gaping cavity almost takes over the entire width of the road. Panic-stricken locals can be heard desperately trying to stop an oncoming car from getting too close. They also attempt to prevent passersby from going too close to the growing crater. On either side of the bridge, waves can be heard crashing as the furious current rushes underneath. The horric conditions have been caused by more than  hours of relentless rainfall, which has resulted in the water levels of nearby Nainital Lake now overflowing. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Many streets and houses have been flooded in the district. It comes after a week after two cars were dramatically swallowed up into a crater full of piping hot water when a sinkhole opened up on the crossroads of two streets in Russia.  A Toyota Corolla Spacio and a Nissan Juke became stuck in the crater after it opened up in Novosibirsk. An eyewitness told local news outlet NGS how the cars had completely sunk into the hole. “One is just about afloat, the other is sinking. It’s awful,” one bystander said at the time.  A Lexus which had been waiting at a red light was towed away from danger after coming to a halt on the edge of the precipice “as it was about fall into the boiling pit”, another local report said. The Toyota and Nissan were believed to be parked outside a business centre when the huge hole appeared on the road. Luckily there were no serious casualties in the incident.

The cash will fund the build of the new vessels to service the Dogger Bank contract. Recently North Star has struck an initial deal to build two world-first hybrid-powered daughter craft in Great Yarmouth with shipbuilder, Alicat.Matthew Gordon, chief executive at North Star, said moving into the offshore wind sector has opened it up to a #much broader pool” of investors that don’t tend to invest in oil and gas.He said: “A lot of people are looking to put money to work in the renewable energy sector and that is what you see with us with that £m project finance facility with Allianz.“Allianz haven#t really put much money maritime service investment in the past,” he added.Recent accounts for the vessel operator show the challenges the offshore sector has faced under both the pandemic and lower oil and gas prices.In the eight months to the end of December , the company recorded a loss of £.m which included vessel depreciation impairment of £.m.Nevertheless, the company was able to affirm that as of the new year it was trading profitably with a number of its vessels having secured long term contracts, also backed by a new £m lending facility with Lloyds Bank-owned Bank of Scotland.Offshore wind doesn’t have the bags of cash that oil and gas used to have and Mr Gordon admits margins aren’t as generous – albeit s for shareholders add up.“In terms of shareholderrequirements, they are slightly lower in the offshore wind market versus in oil and gas,” he said.“But that is because what you are getting is a lower risk product over the longer term.“The wind industry understands one of the main drivers to improving the economic performance of the wind farm in total is actually by allowing the supply chain to access low-cost capital.#What it does, in order to enable that, is to give strong contracts for long periods of time.“What that allows you to do is go to the bank and borrow more money at more attractive rates, which means you can still offer a shareholder a strongwithout necessarily the exact same margin as what you would in oil and gas but you can still generate the same shareholder s.”Mr Gordon is contemplating the growth prospects of the offshore wind sector which is now focused on deeper water much further from the shore from current wind farms.Owner Basalt has doubled down on the need for larger vessels to service deeper waters, such as the SOVs North Star operates. It also acquired Boston Putford in Lowestoft, a firm with a similar family-owned history and culture to North Star. Together the companies are part of the North Star Group and are in a strong position to make a stronghold in the UK offshore wind operations and maintenance market.“In terms of the speed of growth in that market, you are talking between  to  opportunities to bid for in the UK within the next five years,” said Mr Gordon.“Everything up and down the entire east and northern coast of the UK there is going to be wind farms everywhere.“What you#re seeing just now is the wind farms are moving farther from shore. The near shore stuff has been done. The further you go the more you need an SOV.“That is exactly what North Star has been doing for  years.“It is all about staying on location, it is all about being reliable and that is why we have been able to make this transition.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

Link’s head of financial inclusion, stressed many still relied on cash every day – despite the nationwide decline.He said: “People are choosing new ways to pay for things, and Covid has turbocharged the switch to digital.“When we conducted similar analysis this time last year, we had an incomplete picture because before the vaccine rollout people generally were staying local, working from home and many leisure locations were still temporarily closed.“ATM use in some city centres had declined by as much as % overnight. Now that le is ing to normal, people are still visiting ATMs much less often and taking out more each time.“Crucially, even though we’re withdrawing almost £m less per day, millions still rely on cash, especially in the most deprived areas of the country.

will repeat itself when Formartine United face Forfar Athletic in the Scottish Cup.The Loons are the visitors to North Lodge Park in Saturday’s second round tie four years on from being beaten by the Pitmedden outfit in the competition.On that occasion defender Crawford was the unlikely hero for Formartine, popping up with the only goal of the third round tie.The -year-old said: “Liam Burnett had a shot from the edge of the box and it stopped about a yard out and I managed to poke it home.“It wasn’t a special goal, it was a one-yard screamer, as most of my goals are.“But it was good to score the winner in the Scottish Cup and get the club a very good result.“That was a good day for the club, we had nothing to fear playing League One or Two sides and we always fancied our chances.“We’re definitely hoping history can repeat itself – everyone wants a run in the Scottish Cup.”Formartine are also defending a proud Scottish Cup record against sides from a higher level when they meet Forfar this weekend.Since making their debut in the tournament in  United have never been beaten at home by a League One or League Two team.Crawford arrived at North Lodge Park in  and has been part of sides that have taken the scalps of Clydeand Annan Athleticat home as well as Forfar in .The former Montrose, Peterhead and Aberdeen man added: “In my time at Formartine we haven’t been beaten by a League One or Two side in the Scottish Cup.“That’s quite a good record and we’ve had a few good runs in the Scottish Cup.“This season we’ve been a bit inconsistent at times in the league so hopefully we perform on the day against Forfar.”The dream for Breedon Highland League clubs in the Scottish Cup is to progress through the rounds and secure a tie with one of the country’s top clubs.Formartine managed it last season when they played Motherwell.The only disappointment for Crawford was that the game had to be played behind closed doors because of Covid- restrictions.He said: “It’s good for the fans and good for the club.“You want to get to get to the fourth round and then you’ve got the chance of getting a Celtic, Rangers or Aberdeen.“Last season we managed to get Motherwell, it was just a shame we couldn’t have fans there.“That was the first time the club has played a Premiership team at home and it was a shame the fans weren’t there.“Hopefully this season we can do something similar and the fans can be there.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader october 1

We are exceptionally grateful for their continued support and determined to repay that commitment on the pitch whist working closely with them in the wider Borders community.ldquoDuring lockdown we were able to continue to offer rugby activities for the younger children, and during April we were able to support a new Try It Out campaign aimed at children that wouldnrsquot typically have access to rugby or sporting activities because of social or economic barriers. We feel very strongly that the ability to pay shouldnrsquot prevent access to sport.ldquoParents and carers were offered the option to pay what they could, or in some cases nothing at all. Over  boys and girls joined in the fun sessions at the Melrose pitches, and the majority registered to stay on until the end of the summer season. The lting of restrictions has allowed the Southern Knights to launch their buddy scheme aligning some of their semi-professional players to the younger players to help encourage and develop their skills and to inspire children to play to the best of their ability.ldquoThis inclusive ethos is shared by CGI and the award winning Inspire Learning Programme developed in partnership with Scottish Borders Council for pupils from primary four to sixth year in high school throughout the area.ldquoThis uses iPads and an array of other tools to support learning and aims to benefit all children and teachers by raising attainment, support equity and inclusion, and to work towards preparing young people for a digital future. We are keen to continue to support these initiatives in conjunction with CGI over the coming months and years.Dominic Taddei, Chair of Southern Knights Super Board said: ldquoWe are delighted to continue to work a further term with our headline sponsor CGI. Their support through very dficult times has been phenomenal and we look forward to working with them as we get ready to approach the finals day, and to now have the ability to offer a wider audience for FOSROC Super with the fantastic news that was released by Scottish Rugby on rd June  that every Super Sunday fixture has been televised live on free-to-air television by new broadcast partner, FreeSports. The FOSROC Super finals weekend will take place on the weekend of    October, and we look forward to showcasing CGI as our headline sponsor at the finals event.The continuing partnership between CGI and the Southern Knights is not only a relationship supporting sport in the Scottish Borders but also Southern Knights players and coaches are working closely with CGI on community-based initiatives in Borders schools, delivering motivational and inspirational videos for the pupils. CGI employees will also benefit from the relationship with the option to join in fitness sessions at the Greenyards and receiving motivational and leadership messages from the coaches."},{"url":null,"title":"jedburgh-man-admitted-shoplifting-offence-given-unpaid-work","story":"A BORDERS man who admitted theft by shoplting has been ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work at Selkirk Sherf Court.Forty-six-year-old Paul Crowe, of Jedburgh, pleaded guilty to stealing pound worth of items.The items were fully recovered."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-man-drove-almost-four-times-legal-alcohol-limit","story":"A BORDERS man who drove while almost four times the legal alcohol limit has been banned from the road for two years.Fty-six-year-old Allan Knox, of Hawicks Twirlees Terrace, pleaded guilty to the offence which happened in Mart Street, Hawick, on March .Joanne Waller, prosecuting, told Jedburgh Sherf Court that two witnesses saw the accused in Morrisons car park walking towards them in possession of a bottle of wine.They thought he appeared unsteady on his feet and askedhe was drunk or unwell but he replied he was depressed and was slurring his words.He then drove off in towards Linden Crescent and was followed by the witnesses.Ms Waller said Knox ed to the car park and was found by the police asleep in his vehicle with the keys in the ignition.He was arrested and taken to Hawick Police Station where he was cautioned and charged .Knox initially told officers he had not been driven but had earlier gone to Morrisons for a bottle of wine.He pleaded guilty to a charge of driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes ndash the legal limit being .Defence lawyer Ross Dow said his client had been struggling with depression following the end of his -year marriage.Sherf Valerie Johnston noted a previous conviction for drink driving and said as a result the minimumof ban was two years.In addition he was fined pound, reduced from pound due to the guilty plea, and a pound Victim Surcharge was imposed."},{"url":null,"title":"first-class-stamp-honours-first-class-player","story":"BORDERS rugby legend Roy Laidlaw is to feature in a new set of stamps issued by the Royal Mail.The eight stamps in the set mark the th anniversary of the first international rugby match, staged between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh in .Scrum-half Laidlaw, whose two first-half tries against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in Dublin, in , were instrumental in Scotland winning their first Triple Crown since , will feature.The former Jed-Forest star, who was capped -times for his country, recounted: ldquoI remember Ireland won the toss and decided to play against the wind in the first-half.

songs in exchange for sweeties and food.The Collins dictionary defines guising as \"the practice orcustomofdisguisingoneself infancydress, often with amask, andvisitingpeoples houses, especially atHalloween\".According to folklore, children dressed up so they could venture out safely without wicked ghouls detecting them.Homeowners may leave pumpkins or decorations outside their houses to indicate they are welcoming guisers.Is guising dferent to trick or treating Yes, guising is dferent to trick or treating.Traditionally, guising requires you to tell a story or a joke or sing a song, while trick or treating simply requires going up to doors and calling \"trick or treat\".Treat usually refers to a sweetie or food item, while trick refers to thethreat ofa trick being played on homeownersthey dont offer a treat.What other Scottish Halloween traditions take place There are a few moreScottish Halloween traditions aside form guising.Before pumpkin carving became the done thing, Scots traditionally carved turnips instead and filled them with candles.Apple dookin is also a Scottish tradition people have to get apples out of a basin of water using just their mouths.Alternatively, people hold forks in their mouths and drop them from a distance in an attempt to stab an apple.Another tradition was especially for newly engaged couples the couple would each burn a nut on the fire andthe nuts burned quietly a happy union lay ahead, whilethey crackled and hissed there was more likely a turbulent future.A game that has been modernised is treacle scones - back in the day, people used to try to eat scones suspended with strings without using their hands.Nowadays, this game tends to be played using

transmissible that the original Covid iants discovered in .However, with tests currently underway, there is so far no indication that it is signicantly more transmissible, and experts are keen to acknowledge that virus mutation is very common and not necessarily reason for concern.With this in mind, heres what we know about the so-called Delta plus iant...What is Delta plus AY.., or Delta plus, has been described as a \"descendant of Delta\" and was discovered by scientists in July , shortly after Delta became the predominant iant in the UK.While the new iants presence is increasing in the UK, it is not rising as fast as the original Delta earlier this year.Experts are monitoring the iant, however ithas notbeen deemed a\"iant under investigation\" or a \"iant of concern\".Delta plus has mutations which impact the spike protein, which viruses use to attack the bodys cells.If examination finds that this iant is likely to be more infectious than the original Delta, it will be promoted to a \"iant under investigation\".More tests will then be done to determine whether it should become a \"iant of concern\".The good newsis that currently experts do not believe that Delta plus will take hold, meaning it could drop off the watch list soon.What do experts say about Delta plus Professor Francois Balloux, director of University College Londons Genetics Institute, said \"dont panic\" regarding the new iant, which is \"nothing\" like the situation with Alpha or Delta.\"Its nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like  to  percent more transmissible.

Its excellent that we have the facilities and infrastructure in place to see anything that might be a bit suspicious.\"At this stageI would say wait and see, dont panic. It might be slightly, subtly more transmissible but it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously.\"What have Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson said about Delta plus In a tweet posted on Tuesday afternoon, Nicola Sturgeon said: \"The need to monitor this was discussed #at Scottish Government# Cabinet earlier.\"More generally, cases here - though lower than few weeks ago - remain higher than wersquod like.\"So pls take care: wear masks, wash hands, ventilate indoor spaces  get vaccinated.\"Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said:\"Its something were keeping a very close eye on.\"As you would expect were monitoring it closely and wont hesitate to take actionnecessary.\""},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"gas-works-see-road-closures-prestonpans-13-weeks","story":"SGN announced that it would begin work to upgrade its gas network in the Prestonpans area on Monday.The work involves replacing ,m of old metal gas mains and service pipes with new plastic pipe, ensuring a continued safe and reliable gas supply to the local community.SGN has planned its work in close consultation with local authorities to reduce disruption as much as possible.The project will be carried out by SGN contractor George Ritchie  Son.During the works, parking restrictions will be in operation allowing safe access to the pipe ndash some road closures will also be required.Temporary traffic signals will be in operation at certain times, which may cause delays during peak periods.Emergency vehicle access will be maintained throughout the work.The gas work will be suspended during the Christmas holidays, with operatives ing early in the new year.Road closures include Prestongrange Terracersquos junction with Prestongrange Road, and Polwarth Terracersquos junction with Gardiner Terrace.To minimise disruption, SGN work will be carried out on a phased basis and not all streets will be affected at the same time.Access to driveways and garages will be maintained unless previously agreed with the occupier.An SGN spokesperson said: ldquoWersquoll be working as quickly as possible to complete our work and will be making every effort to minimise inconvenience to the local community.Suspension of parking is as follows:Prestonpans Community Council is calling for greater clarity on road works in and around the town, ideally in the form of an interactive map showing all the restrictions over time.A spokesperson for the community council said: ldquoInidual roadworks are obviously necessary for the maintenance of our public utilities.ldquoHowever, there is a balance to be struck between maintenance and what can quickly become a public nuisance.ldquoIf roadworks are all planned to minimise distribution, there is currently no way of telling.

Ireland Heres everything you need to know about the Scots term guising, how it dfers from trick or treating and other Scottish Halloween traditions.Guising derives from the word disguise, and is based on the notion that people dress up at Halloween.Children dress up and go from house to house, telling jokes and stories or singing songs in exchange for sweeties and food.The Collins dictionary defines guising as \"the practice orcustomofdisguisingoneself infancydress, often with amask, andvisitingpeoples houses, especially atHalloween\".According to folklore, children dressed up so they could venture out safely without wicked ghouls detecting them.Homeowners may leave pumpkins or decorations outside their houses to indicate they are welcoming guisers.Yes, guising is dferent to trick or treating.Traditionally, guising requires you to tell a story or a joke or sing a song, while trick or treating simply requires going up to doors and calling \"trick or treat\".Treat usually refers to a sweetie or food item, while trick refers to thethreat ofa trick being played on homeownersthey dont offer a treat.There are a few moreScottish Halloween traditions aside form guising.Before pumpkin carving became the done thing, Scots traditionally carved turnips instead and filled them with candles.Apple dookin is also a Scottish tradition people have to get apples out of a basin of water using just their mouths.Alternatively, people hold forks in their mouths and drop them from a distance in an attempt to stab an apple.Another tradition was especially for newly engaged couples the couple would each burn a nut on the fire andthe nuts burned quietly a happy union lay ahead, whilethey crackled and hissed there was more likely a turbulent future.A game that has been modernised is treacle scones - back in the day, people used to try to eat scones suspended with strings without using their hands.Nowadays, this game tends to be played using donuts."},{"url":null,"title":"black-friday-2021-black-friday-year-uk---date-time","story":"Originally an American tradition which sees huge discounts the day after Thanksgiving, it has now become a

It would also reduce the Nationalistsrsquo representation to the minority which its votes justy in Scotland.In these circumstances, it is laudable that the SNP supports PR when it will cut them down to size. All other parties ought to join them in fighting for its introduction, which will open a new chapter in British politics.Indeed, the need for coalitions and compromise might be just what we need to end the culture of antagonism and hostility which so blights Scotland and the wider UK.Peter A. Russell, Jordanhill, Glasgow.REMEMBERING SIR DAVID AMESSWHEN Sir David Amess was a young MP in the s with, I think, four young children, my brother, John Francis Sheridan, moved from Glasgow with his we and three children to live in Davidrsquos constituency in Basildon.Tragically, in , while visiting family in Glasgow, John Francis died very suddenly of a brain haemorrhage.Our family has always found it a source of comfort that David Amess, for no political capital, took the time to travel away from his very busy le in Basildon to attend, in an act of private kindness, my brotherrsquos funeral in Glasgow.Now, the hope has been expressed that the tragic death of Sir David Amess will encourage greater kindness in public le also.Michael Sheridan, Scotstoun, Glasgow.CHANGING GPSrsquo WORKING MODELLESLEY Riddoch raises many questions with regard to pressing issues associated with the NHS .I would refer, in particular, to her comment concerning the next generation of GPs being prepared to agree, as part of future changes, the end of the old independent contractor model.The problems in originally establishing the NHS ndash the National Health Act was passed in  ndash were fundamental, complicated and challenging. Not least was the task of securing the agreement of the British Medical Association, representing GPs, which had objected to the legislation.Eventually Aneurin Bevan, the Health Secretary, after much dficult and detailed negotiation, made concessions such as allowing greater control to GPs over their incomes, rather than flat salaries, and the right to work wherever they chose to do so, rather than under direction .Eventually, a deal was done and the new arrangements were able to commence on July , .There are those today who maintain that all that was  years or so ago and that the operation of general practice has not changed much since then. Accordingly, a new arrangement is overdue and much needed.With all that background, one wonders about how willing GPs would be to become effectively employees of the state as a result of the introduction of such changes.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.INDEPENDENCE AND NHS BUDGETSRICHARD Richardsonargues that responsibility for poor performance of Scotlandrsquos NHS lies in the assertion that ldquohealth spending in Scotland was ldquo% higher in - and just % higher in - than in England.However, the Institute for Fiscal Studiesreport he relies on makes clear a few lines later that this is due to ldquoa growing share of the health portfoliorsquos budget going to early years and adult social care services, consistent with a  decision by the Scottish Government at that time to focus on preventive medicine and keeping people out of hospital.In any event, the report concludes that the evidence, ldquodoes not, overall, suggest the apparent lsquosqueezersquo in relative health spending levels has led to a relative decline in service performance, at least over the last decade.However, is there a reason why Mr Richardsonrsquos base year is   for comparison to  years later  If we examine the two health budgets, capital investment in the former is pound. million, but by   only pound million.Perhaps the reason for the decline in health funding can be explained not only by the transfer of resources into health and social care, but also that Glasgowrsquos Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary had been completed, thus increasing the health budget in the earlier period ndash but for reasons of capital expenditure.GERS is also quoted with apparent authority, but one thing those who use it to condemn independence routinely forget is that on page  the report says it ldquoaddresses three questions about Scotlandrsquos public sector finances under the current constitutional arrangements.How legitimate is using a report written about Scotland as part of the UK to make exact predictions about Scotland when independent Mr Richardsonrsquos conclusion that ldquoersion of funding away from our NHS by the SNP government has been shown to be questionable, and certainly does not rebut David Crawfordrsquos conclusionthat ldquoScotland needs to educate and train more medical staff in all grades and positions, and it needs to fund the NHS properly.The decision whether to do so, taken within the UK, will almost entirely be determined by a Westminster government ldquointent on privatising health care.Only under independence can the decision on how much to spend on the NHS in Scotland be taken in Scotland.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.OVERHAULING HUMAN RIGHTSAT the Conservative Party Conference, the Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab, announced plans to lsquooverhaulrsquo the Human Rights Act.Last weekend he explained what this improvement in legislation would involve. ldquoWhere there have been judgements that ndash albeit properly and duly delivered by the courts ndash we think are wrong, the right thing is for parliament to legislate to correct them.This raises the question of who the lsquowersquo are.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

No one wants ato the draconian measures that have been in place for so long.The Executive has identied a robust and dynamic communication strategy as key in achieving this. Time will tellit can stay on message.Most ReadPSNI confirm ex-RUC officer Brian Coulter is Magherafelt murder victimNI petrol station halts unleaded sales after ‘contamination’ reportsMurder investigation launched after Jake Bailey-Sloandies following incident outside Portadown pubJohn LavertyOpinionDrug dealer Noel Johnston was the hardest of hard men in a dangerous town... and he was only a teenager at the timeMark BainOpinionBrian Coulter’s death…the murder next door: I received a message from a relative enquiring what was going on outside my houseTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ddda .ece AUTOCROP wh bbaafcafcfcbed.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ddda .ece AUTOCROP wh bbaafcafcfcbed.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police protect Army convoy after breakdown in BelfastPlayVideo: Fire Fighters battle major blaze in Antrim PlayVideo: Man arrested as murder investigation is launched in MagherafeltLatest Northern IrelandIreland’s last maypole in Co Down is replaced after storm damageExecutive’s winter plan to protect health service could lead to new restrictions tenants wait over a month for action to tackle verminHockey player’s project aims to train  young lesaversMilestone: Over half of Sinn Fein MLAs now women, says Michelle O’NeillLatestAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobCiarán DunbarOpinionWhy being back in the office and chatting at the water cooler will pose a problemKFC Foundation: Empowering young people of NI in their communitiesCaoimhin’s proud to represent NI... even though people from here tried to kill himIreland’s last maypole in Co Down is replaced after storm damage,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Claudy para-triathletes Chloe and Judith MacCombe have put themselves in pole position for a place in the Northern Ireland team for the Commonwealth Games after claiming first and second place at the national championships in Limerick. Chloe’s gold medal finish and her twin sister Judith’s runner up spot was a reverse of the result at the same competition in Drogheda pre lockdown in . googletag.cmd.push It leaves them in eighth and tenth place respectively in the Commonwealth Games rankings where the top ten will qualy for the games in Birmingham next summer. They have been working daily towards their goal at the Foyle Arena where Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Athlete Support Membership Scheme gives them free access to Council leisure facilities. The -year-olds are former students at Limavady Grammar and were diagnosed at birth with a form of albinism that means their sight is around one third of what someone with   vision would experience. They have barely spent a day apart in those  years and both studied geography at Ulster University in Coleraine during which time a chance meeting with Irish triathlon high performance coach Eamon Tilley guided them towards the gruelling discipline.     “We weren’t overly sporty growing up,” Chloe recalled. “We got involved in rugby and rowing at Coleraine and were talent spotted by the Irish para rowing team and while we were there Eamon Tilley suggested we try the triathlon. “We started going to training days in  and we took part in our first race in , we didn’t perform that well but enjoyed the challenge of pushing ourselves so we did a few more events and started to improve.” The big breakthrough for the girls came in  when Judith claimed first and Chloe second place at the National Paratriathlon Championships at Pulse Port Beach in Drogheda, it looked to be the start of an exciting period but the Covid  pandemic led to an end to all competition in . “It was a big challenge to keep the momentum of our training going during lockdown,” said Judith. “We had been coming to the Foyle Arena  or  times a week so to lose access was a big blow. “We have an intimate knowledge of the back roads of Claudy from all the cycling and running we did while the centre was closed, it has been great to get access back, particularly in the pool which has now been ided up for dferent swimming speeds.” “Limerick was our first major event after lockdown so we weren’t sure how it would go,” Chloe added. “I am stronger on the bike but I knew Judith would make up ground on me on the run so I had to make sure I had a lead. “The membership scheme has had a massive impact on our success, training for a triathlon is very expensive and we don’t get any funding so it has been a real leline. “The facilities at the Foyle Arena are world class and the staff and coaches here have been very accommodating and taken a genuine interest in our journey. “To compete at the Commonwealth Games alongside my sister would be a dream come true and that goal drives us each day to train harder and get faster.” Opportunities The Athlete Support Membership Scheme aims to provide talented local athletes involved in an amateur sport with the best possible opportunities to develop and prepare for competition. Applicants must be currently part of a recognised gover​ning body, talent pathway or be officially representing their sport at county level or higher. Applicants who fulfil the criteria will be entitled to six months free access to gym, health suite and swimming pool facilities, they must be involved in an amateur sport which is recognised by either Sport Northern Ireland or the Irish Sports Council. Sports coordinator at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Keith Thompson, said: “World level athletes need world class facilities to compete at the highest level and we are delighted to be able to support a number of elite athletes at the Foyle Arena through free membership. “The team at the Foyle Arena are delighted for them and we are pleased to have played a role in their success.” To apply for the Athlete Support Membership scheme e mail Keith at keith.thompson@ derrystrabane.

But there are problems with access to local properly facilitated play areas across much of the city and district. Over the past two years we have all experienced how important it is to get outside and connect with nature so now more than ever we need to continue to support this positive mind set for our children.

As part of a wider campaign of thanksgiving, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, has called on everyone to show their appreciation through a gesture of thanks directed at someone who played a role in helping others over the past  months. googletag.cmd.push From today until Sunday next, October , buildings in the council area will be illuminated in purple to shine a light on the outstanding efforts made by those not just on the frontline in the NHS, but in our shops, our pharmacies, our care homes, our schools, and in the wider community. Mayor Warke is also asking local people to personally recognise those who made a dference to them by saying thank you, or making a small gesture with a gt or a card. He said: These have been unprecedented times of great hardship and fear for many people and we have come through this thanks to the wide network of dedicated workers and volunteers who have sustained our communities when we most needed help. I would like to ask people to think about someone who made a dference to their lives during lockdown, whether through their day-to-day work or volunteering in the community.     “It could be someone who delivered food parcels, who worked in a shop throughout the pandemic despite the risk, who reached out to an elderly neighbour, or checked in on a loved one. Everyone has been through an incredibly dficult experience, and I think we have all been touched by acts of kindness that have lted our spirits in the darkest of times. “Now, as we gradually emerge from lockdown, its a great time to say thank you for the small things that have sustained us, and the people who made a dference when we most needed it. The Week of Thanksgiving stems from a council motion passed in February this year calling for recognition of the local effort in response to Covid-. The motion called on the local authority to formally acknowledge the good work of the community and voluntary sector by considering all opportunities to recognise workers and volunteers in the sector. pound, was set aside for a number of recognition initiatives taking place throughout the year.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey was laid to rest on Saturday Derry NewsKatrinaRainey: “alady of gold” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  You havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MP on Irish historyNational NewsYou havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MP on Irish history overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings. He continued: The efforts that have been made by so many in recent months to drive up vaccination rates and step-up compliance with mitigations do seem to be working. It is vital that we dont let up.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey was laid to rest on Saturday Derry NewsKatrinaRainey: “alady of gold” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  You havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MP on Irish historyNational NewsYou havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MP on Irish history overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey was laid to rest on Saturday Derry NewsKatrinaRainey: “alady of gold” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  You havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MP on Irish historyNational NewsYou havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MP on Irish history overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

Rhonda McKean, , had a bout of painful sciatica that made it dficult to walk. Using a rollator frame, she took a fall and was told by her Doctors surgery, Oakleaf Medical Practice, to make her way to Altnagelvin. googletag.cmd.push However, a nine-hour wait in pain followed that didnt even result in Mrs McKean being seen that day. As a result, she had to make ajourney where she was eventually X-rayed. She said: “Six weeks ago, I had sciatica and during the night, it became so uncomfortable that it wouldnt let me walk. “I had a rollator in the house and I thought Id use that because theres no way that I would be able to get about. “Unfortunately, I managed to fall hard on to the ground and I knew that I hurt my back. “I rang the doctors surgery and was told Id get a call back from the doctor. Instead, I get a call back from the physiotherapist.     “He told me to come overso I struggled over and he told me I needed to go to Altnagelvin Hospital for an X-ray on my hip because he thought I had fractured that. “I told him that I definitely hadnt fractured my hip but had hurt my back. The X-ray showed that I hadnt broken my hip. “I went back to the surgery and the physio went to get the doctor who came back and told me that the physio wanted me to go to Altnagelvin because he thinks youve had a stroke. “I then get to Altnagelvin where I sat in the waiting area at casualty for nine hours. “I had been sent to get a brain scan but they wouldnt do one because they said I didnt have a stroke. “But during all that time, I was in pure agony as having been sitting in AE for nine hours. My back was broke but the doctors hadnt told me as they hadnt read the report in the bone scan. “I later had an X-ray and was told I had an L lumber fracture. I then had a further MRI scan.” Unfortunately, that scan would bring bad news for Mrs McKean which was compounded by it being given not by her GP at Oakfield Medical Practice, but by the receptionist. Mrs McKean added: “Last Friday , I got a letter to go to X-ray for an ultrasound on my thyroid. “I phoned up the surgery to speak to my GP to ask why I have been requested to go for an ultrasound to my thyroid. “The girl on reception put me on hold and then came back to tell me, the MRI scan showed a growth on your thyroid. “The receptionist told me that and the doctor himself couldnt even let me know. He didnt even have the decency to phone me and tell me this was happening. Yet its left to a receptionist to tell me point-blankely because theywont let me speak to a doctor.” Regarding Mrs McKeans nine-hour wait at Altnagelvin, a spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said: “Due to patient client confidentiality we would not be responding to inidual cases. “If a patient client or their relative has any issue in relation to their treatment or the service they have received, we would encourage them to raise these issues through the Trusts comments and complaints system - the Patients Advocate Office. “The Patients Advocate Office can be contacted on . All complaints received are investigated promptly and a response issued to the person.” And in relation to how Oakfield Medical Practice broke the news to Mrs McKean of her thyroid growth diagnosis, a spokesperson for the Health and Social Care Board added: “It would not be appropriate to discuss issues in relation to inidual patients. “The patient should raise her concerns with the practice in the first instance andnot satisfied following that can approach the Health and Social Care Board through the complaints process. “If the complaint cannot be resolved through the HSC Complaints Procedure the patient can approach the NI Public Services Ombudsman.”  Defendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told  Thomas Rainey was remanded in custody until November .

An event held in Coleraine by Cuil Rathain Historical and Cultural Centre to mark the centenary of the establishment of Northern Ireland included a re-enactment of a B Specials checkpoint and drill demonstration as part of its itinerary. googletag.cmd.push Alongside music and dance demonstrations, involving bands and Lambeg drums, and childrens arts and crafts activities, a group held a historical re-enactment, complete with unorms and props.  The B Specials, known as the Ulster Special Constabulary, was formed just before partition, and was almost exclusively Protestant. They were involved in a number of controversial incidents, including the attack on civil rights marchers at Burntollet in , before being disbanded in . East Derry MLA Cara Hunter said the staging of the re-enactment was not appropriate. I am shocked that the organisers of this event thought that this was in any way appropriate, said the SDLP representative.     Contrary to the public comments from the festival organisers, there is no positivity associated with this sectarian force that maimed and murdered Catholics at Civil Rights protests. Cara Hunter MLA “The inclusion of this event in this centenary programme is isive, crass and alienating. It sends a clear message that the organisers have no interest in promoting cross community cohesion. More to the point, it suggests that the B Specials represent the tradition of unionism here. That could not be further from the truth. The event was advertised as being funded by the Ulster Scots Agency and Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, with the organisations providing pound, and pound, respectively. However, the Cuil Rathain Historical and Cultural Centre said the re-enactment had been entirely self-funded. We feel it is important that we, as the lead partner of the organising committee, clary the situation in relation to funding arrangements in respect of the B Specials Historical Re-enactment group, they said. We wish to confirm that this element of the programme is being self-funded entirely by the organisers. No funding awarded by either Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council or the Ulster Scots Agency will be used in respect of this element of the event programme. We hope that this statement claries the situation and allays any concerns anyone may have. On the day after the event, the group also shared what they described as an informative presentation on the B Specials to their Facebook page.

Sinn Feacuteins Cllr Sean Bateson used a discussion on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Grant Funding Policy Review to raise a question on the funding of a NI centenary event held at the weekend. googletag.cmd.push The event, part-funded by the Council, featured a historical re-enactment of a B-Specials drill demonstration and checkpoint, described by a local SDLP MLA as isive and crass. The organising committee of the event issued a statement to say no Council funding had been used to fund the demonstration. Cllr Sean Bateson Cllr Bateson asked officials at the Leisure and Development Committee to clary no public money had been spent on it. “I would like to speak on . on item  and specically, the NI small grants fund,” said the representative for Bann. “Can I ask the director for clarity on the awarding of this grant and in relation to the grossly inappropriate and deeply insensitive event at Coleraine Town Hall at the weekend      “My community was disgusted at this event and the re-enactment featuring a military display of the B-Specials. “The history of the B-Specials speaks for itself. It was effectively established as the paramilitary wing of the Orange state and was designed to subjugate nationalists and republicans. “For nationalists and republicans, such an event yet again clearly illustrates that the centenary of partition is being used by certain quarters as a show of triumphalism. “Can the director clary and put on recordthis grant went towards the funding and display of this event and the group that was involved in it  “Can the director give me a breakdown of the total Council funding and what it went towards ” Cllr John McAuley Committee Chair, Cllr John McAuley, told Cllr Bateson his question was not related to the agenda item the Grant Funding Policy Review. “You are quite aware that this isnt even part of the agenda,” said the DUP representative. “You did attempt to put in an AORBwhich you were too late for, and now you have decided to try and slip it in to make a few headlines with your republican agenda. “I try not to rise to these sort of things, but its a case of offended by everything and ashamed of nothing. Cllr Bateson began to protest that it was in fact part of the agenda, but Cllr McAuley told him he would chair the meeting as I choose to chair it. “Im the Chair, so Ill speakI want to speak. As a proud son of a B-man, I will not be letting you try and take over this Committee tonight to whitewash history. “Ill chair the meeting as I choose to chair it,” he added. Cllr George Duddy Cllr George Duddy then called a point of order, stating thatCllr Bateson continually interrupted the Chair, the Committee could vote on point of order . that the member not be heard on this item. “When the Chair speaks during the debate, any member speaking at the time must stop and the meeting must be silent,” said the DUP councillor. “Im not sure that Cllr Bateson understands standing orders, but you have asked him on more than one occasion, which is your perogative, to cease speaking, and he has continued to interrupt. “If Cllr Bateson continues, I will call point of order . for a member not to be heard any longer.” “Go ahead Cllr Duddy, I think it shows your agenda,” replied Cllr Bateson. The Committee then voted in favour of the point of order intervention, with nine voting for, two against and three abstentions. It marks the second time in four weeks that a Sinn Feacutein councillor has been subject to point of order . and no longer permitted to speak on an item. Cllr Duddy also called the point of order on Glens councillor Cara McShane at a previous meeting of the Leisure and Development Committee. The incident arose after a fellow DUP councillor claimed Cllr McShane insinuated he was a fool.  MLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry  The demonstration took place on Saturday.

Sinn Feacuteins Cllr Sean Bateson used a discussion on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Grant Funding Policy Review to raise a question on the funding of a NI centenary event held at the weekend. googletag.cmd.push The event, part-funded by the Council, featured a historical re-enactment of a B-Specials drill demonstration and checkpoint, described by a local SDLP MLA as isive and crass. The organising committee of the event issued a statement to say no Council funding had been used to fund the demonstration. Cllr Sean Bateson Cllr Bateson asked officials at the Leisure and Development Committee to clary no public money had been spent on it. “I would like to speak on . on item  and specically, the NI small grants fund,” said the representative for Bann. “Can I ask the director for clarity on the awarding of this grant and in relation to the grossly inappropriate and deeply insensitive event at Coleraine Town Hall at the weekend      “My community was disgusted at this event and the re-enactment featuring a military display of the B-Specials. “The history of the B-Specials speaks for itself. It was effectively established as the paramilitary wing of the Orange state and was designed to subjugate nationalists and republicans. “For nationalists and republicans, such an event yet again clearly illustrates that the centenary of partition is being used by certain quarters as a show of triumphalism. “Can the director clary and put on recordthis grant went towards the funding and display of this event and the group that was involved in it  “Can the director give me a breakdown of the total Council funding and what it went towards ” Cllr John McAuley Committee Chair, Cllr John McAuley, told Cllr Bateson his question was not related to the agenda item the Grant Funding Policy Review. “You are quite aware that this isnt even part of the agenda,” said the DUP representative. “You did attempt to put in an AORBwhich you were too late for, and now you have decided to try and slip it in to make a few headlines with your republican agenda. “I try not to rise to these sort of things, but its a case of offended by everything and ashamed of nothing. Cllr Bateson began to protest that it was in fact part of the agenda, but Cllr McAuley told him he would chair the meeting as I choose to chair it. “Im the Chair, so Ill speakI want to speak. As a proud son of a B-man, I will not be letting you try and take over this Committee tonight to whitewash history. “Ill chair the meeting as I choose to chair it,” he added. Cllr George Duddy Cllr George Duddy then called a point of order, stating thatCllr Bateson continually interrupted the Chair, the Committee could vote on point of order . that the member not be heard on this item. “When the Chair speaks during the debate, any member speaking at the time must stop and the meeting must be silent,” said the DUP councillor. “Im not sure that Cllr Bateson understands standing orders, but you have asked him on more than one occasion, which is your perogative, to cease speaking, and he has continued to interrupt. “If Cllr Bateson continues, I will call point of order . for a member not to be heard any longer.” “Go ahead Cllr Duddy, I think it shows your agenda,” replied Cllr Bateson. The Committee then voted in favour of the point of order intervention, with nine voting for, two against and three abstentions. It marks the second time in four weeks that a Sinn Feacutein councillor has been subject to point of order . and no longer permitted to speak on an item. Cllr Duddy also called the point of order on Glens councillor Cara McShane at a previous meeting of the Leisure and Development Committee. The incident arose after a fellow DUP councillor claimed Cllr McShane insinuated he was a fool.

Sinn Feacutein councillor denied permission to speak after fool comment  A point of order was called by DUP councillors Adrian McQuillan and William Duddy.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

She made the comments during a segment on her late night show, Claire Byrne Live, with former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage. The pro-Brexiteer questioned Irelands membership of the European Union and said, Why dont you ask yourselves in Dublin a question  Why did you fight the British for five hundred years - five hundred often very bloody, dficult years - until the s, what was the point of ityoure now governed by [sic]  googletag.cmd.push Mr Farage recently went viral for saying the Irish Republican phrase Up the Ra in a birthday greeting video, the meaning of which he stated he had no knowledge of. This was then raised by Ms Byrne, who played the clip and said, I want people to see just how much you know about the history and culture on this island. She continued: I know you said sorry, I know you get eighty seven quid and its entirely within your rights to do that, but come on, dont try to lecture the Irish people on the culture and history and precarious nature of peace on this island. You havent got a clue.     Mr Farage concluded by saying, Do you want to be an Independent democratic nature or governed by foreign bureaucrats  Thats the question that Ireland will ask itself. Those of you in the national media and national policies in Dublin will fight that as hard as you can because you will benefit financially. Do the Irish people wish to be independent or not  That is a debate that will happen in your country in the next few years, believe you [sic].

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Oct   addthis, Eoin Toal insists that he and his team mates will give everything between now and the end of the season as Derry City close in on third place and European football. The City captain played a massive role in the - win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell on Friday night, a victory which takes the Candystripes to within one point of third-placed Sligo Rovers. googletag.cmd.push Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe scored the only goal of the game to give City a signicant victory at an important stage of the season. “St. Pat’s are a great side and they are not second in the table for no reason,” Toal said afterwards. “We knew it was going to be a tough game. In the first half we weren’t our best and they probably had a few chances in the first half to go one or two up the main thing for us was to just dig in until half time and come in with a level head. “We knew we would get a few chances and we knew we would have to take them. Jack Malone came on and was brilliant, he gave the ball to Jamie who put in a brilliant cross for Junior to finish and that’s what he’s good at. We dug in really well after that and that’s a sign of a really structured team. We held out at the end there which was really good.”     City have come a long way in a short time under Ruaidhri Higgins, with European football now a real possibility. The team spirit is better than ever for a team that began the season with four successive defeats. “Ruaidhri has been brilliant since he came in,” Toal reiterated. “There’s a really good team spirit at the moment. We know how good a manager is and he definitely wants to bring good football to the Brandywell. “ It will be interesting but we have a big task ourselves and, hopefully, we can push on and try and get into that third spot. That’s our aim, and it’s going to be hard but we’re going to have to dig in and, hopefully, try to get it. “Everyone has to play each other so it’s going to be really tough but hopefully we can take each game as it comes and get the points we need.” Unavoidable The question of Europe is now unavoidable for Higgins, whose team have suffered just one defeat in the last nine league games. With home games against Bohemians and Sligo Rovers still to come, there is no doubt that Derry’s destiny is in their own hands. “Theres no point in playing the question down now with six games to go, he admitted. This was signicant. I think and it puts us right in the hunt for that place. The players deserve huge credit for getting themselves in this position. Its set up for us and well give it a real crack and see where it takes us. If we dont get into Europe it wont be for the want of trying because the players are giving absolutely everything. The staff are giving everything and have been brilliant to work with and theres a real good feel factor around the place at the minute and long may that continue. Friday also saw the biggest attendance at the Brandywell this season, with close to , fans cheering the team on to victory. Those rising numbers could well prove pivotal to City in the remaining games. “The crowd were absolutely brilliant tonight especially when Pats were dominating and had large periods in the game,” Higgins agreed. “They got right behind us and the dference when theres supporters in is mind blowing compared to when theyre not here. “Our supporters I think can identy with this team and appreciate what the players are giving and the players appreciate what the supporters are giving as well so hopefully it remains that way for a long, long time.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

Photo: Tom Heaney Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, has described Jason Smyth as inspirational as he hosted a civic reception for the fastest Paralympian on the planet. Eglinton runner Smyth won his sixth Paralympic gold medal in a thrilling final of the T m race at this years Paralympic Games, which took place in Tokyo at the end of August. googletag.cmd.push It extended the world record holders medal tally at major eventsto . Mayor Warke invited Jason and his family to the Guildhall for a special civic reception to mark the continued success of the man nicknamed the GoldSmyth. Speaking after the event, Mayor Warke said: It was an honour to have Jason in the Mayors Parlour and to be able to congratulate him personally on the remarkable success that he has had. To win a sixth Paralympic gold medal and to remain unbeaten in ​years of Paralympics is something most sports people couldnt even dream of. It takes a serious amount of commitment, hard work and sacrice behind the scenes to reach that level of greatness and to perform on the biggest stage, and Jason has managed to do that year in, year out. He has represented our city and district on the world stage, and I felt it was only right that I show our appreciation on behalf of all the people of this Council area.     I want to wish Jason and his family all the very best and, hopefully, we are celebrating even more medals in the future. Jason is an inspiration to so many of us locally and to so many globally as well. His story is one that already has its rightful place in the history books and Im sure there are a few more chapters still to be written. Jason said overcoming injuries, dealing with the Covid- delay to the Games, and winning the final by just . seconds made his latest Paralympic gold one of the sweetest yet. I think, on reflection, because the race was so close and the lead up was so dficult, when I think back on all of the Games, its definitely been the most satisfying win. When Ive needed to get things right, Ive been able to do it - by the finest of margins - but when it counted. When I sit back and look at it, I can say that really went as well as it could have, so its very satisfying, but now Im thinking whats next and Im ready to move forward. He added it was great to be able to attend a Mayors reception and spend time with family members who had supported his journey. Sometimes, were away in the likes of Tokyo and were in our bubble and unaware of whats going on at home or whos watching, but when we do come home its great to see the recognition, the support, and the awareness. Its great to come into the Guildhall with the Mayor and have a reception with family because they are often the people who make the most sacrices.

He creates dark ambient as An Trinse, lo-fi Techno as TFT and has the monthly show ‘First Trans- mission’ on Threads radio. He also works as a designer and animator who has created multi-disciplinary work for clients including Nike and Adidas.  What influences you  googletag.cmd.push “With the An Trinse project I’ve always thought of it as being indebted musically to the surrealism of Nurse with Wound and later Coil with a heavy dose of Irish history in there. “My techno records as TFT are much more straightforward and fit into the classic Dutch Clone Viewlex template or L.I.E.S. I’ve enjoyed handing over the visual side to Ben Lee who is an incredible designer. The current visual work with Maxwell Sterling stems from getting obsessed with Peter Greenway a long time ago and suddenly having an outlet for this baroque sensibility. “Max’s work is so rich and cinematic I was instantly inspired to find a way to create a version of the layered theatrical world of Prosperos Books mixed with images generated via AI with painterly elements and I think we have arrived at a pretty inidual visual soup.”     Any Irish stuff out there  “Some of my favourite Irish music of the last few years has come from the label Fort Evil Fruit, they have built up a formidable discography over the last decade across the spectrum of experimental sound. “Also, a big fan of From the Bogs of Aughuska as we share a love of the crossover of Irish History, drone, and black metal who I always thought deserved more attention, but I guess it’s a bit of a niche interest. “Recently been loving the unpronounceable Lighght from Cork who makes really eclectic danceable electronica”. How was your lockdown  “I can’t pretend I didn’t think it was the end of the world at the start but once we settled into the long-drawn-out boring apocalypse it has shaken up my work a bit. I was in great form, had just completed an An Trinse audio-visual show which premiered at one of CTM festival in Berlin’s associated events in January and was hoping to tour the projects throughout the year plus was in the process of setting up a celebratory gig for my split album with Il Santo Bevitore. “I had also just worked on the visual direction of the NME awards which was one of the biggest projects I had overseen. “That all went in the bin along with my main revenue source working as an editor and animator in the creative industry, so it was a very scary few months till everything stabilised a bit. I tried to use the time to collaborate with artists on music videos which crazily ended up helping on Kylie Minogue’s online show and directing a piece for Yousef and Gorgon City. “I also ended up exhibiting work in some online exhibitions which has led to my current work with the Most Dismal Swamp collective but there was a lot of staring at the wall wondering where it was all going. “Later in the year, I did some online gigs including a collaboration with Bratislavan artists Monika Subrtova which felt gooda little weird staring in a camera in an empty room. The project with Maxwell came out of lockdown as well, we were both working on a video project with architecture collective The Decorators who were similarly trying to find ways to show work when everyone is stuck in the house. “That project has just been shown at the V  A museum at the London Design Festival which was a bit of a dream come true.” New normal  “I’m hoping that the show me and Maxwell are doing at MIRA festival in Barcelona is the start of something positive for the new year. We were slightly shocked to get booked so early as we had so far only presented an embryonic version of the show once and was a bit of a disaster technically. “We have done one more show since and its light years ahead now and very excited about presenting it on m screens.”  Any music over there you’d recommend  “Well i would definitely say check out Max’s new album ‘Turn of Phrase’, I’m extremely excited about working on the live presentation and its without doubt one of the best albums of the year. “My pal Yaws is also putting out some wild bendy tempo electronics that you will struggle to pin down. “Also,anyone is interested in the world of digital art and experimental music, I would check out Clot magazine ran by my wonderful other half.” www.clotmag news performance-maxwell-sterling-stephen-mclaughlin-a-v-at-space--london  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast. Most of the children in that school live very close to the mast site and the consequences will be disastrousthey have to live and study under it, he said.DARRAGH CROSS ndash A Planning Service decision to refuse permission for a new filling station and shop in Darragh Cross has been strongly criticised by a local councillor.Miss Margaret Ritchie said the decision not to grant planning permission to Mr J C Flanagan for the development near the junction of the Darragh and Manse roads, showed a ldquocomplete lack of common sense.Planners gave four reasons for refusing the development which would have been the villagersquos first purpose-built shop.It was ruled that the site was in a countryside area and on a minor road and because no special circumstances were demonstrated, a relaxation of the planning controls would not be allowed.Planners also pointed out the development site is within the Belfast green belt area and is outside the development limits for Darragh Cross.DUNDRUM ndash Pupils at Sacred Heart Primary School in Dundrum are enjoying the benefits of an exciting environmental project thanks to the efforts of the Mourne Heritage Trust and the Princersquos Trust.Volunteers from both organisations were at the school recently to build a wildle pond and insect garden and also plant shrubs.Mr Gerry Carey, Princersquos Trust team leader, thanked the Mourne Heritage Trust for assisting and supervising the volunteers and for providing equipment to carry out the project.He also thanked Mr Patrick McParland, school principal, for his hospitality during the week.Mr McParland expressed his delight at the work carried out by the Princersquos Trust and also thanked the ranger and countryside team from the Mourne Heritage Trust for their help throughout the project.BALLYNAHINCH ndash A colourful ballon launch in Ballynahinch yesterday marked a vital step forward for children with speech and language dficulties.Education charity, I-CAN, officially threw open the doors of its first pioneering centre in Northern Ireland, at Ballynahinch Primary School, to provide the best start in le for children who have problems communicating.Laughter rang out from the bright classroom where three and four year-olds, who would otherwise start primary school unable to communicate, read or write, were having fun and learning together in the colourful new suite.The children who would normally feel frustrated, isolated or unconfident because they cannot communicate, are helped by a speech and language therapist, nursery teacher and classroom assistant, who work together to assess, plan and work with the children.STRANGFORD ndash Crew members on the Strangford ferry have reacted angrily to news that the Roads Service may privatise the servicersquos workforce.The government is interested in the idea of public private partnership and is studying the market to see how effective it would bethe crew was transferred to the private sector.However, the ferryrsquos employees are adamant that this would be the wrong move saying their interests would be overlooked in a private ownerrsquos quest for profit.They are also worried that there may be job losses and other cutbacks which could lead to an inadequate service for passengers.A spokesman for the crew said all employees object to the idea of privatisation adding they have all been kept in the dark about what the government is proposing to do.Around  people work on the ferry on a daily basis and he said that everyone is worried that the rights they have fought for over the years will be eroded by a private owner.Some of the staff have worked on the ferry for over  years and all are concerned that a private owner will only be interested in money and will not be able to retain the current conditionsldquoWe have all been kept in the dark about what is happening. There had been some talk a few months ago abut the privatising the crew but we thought it had all fallen through..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Delight.jpg","title":"Delight Shimna Road work scheme begins  ","story":"THE start of work this week on the poundm Shimna Road flood alleviation scheme in Newcastle has been welcomed by local politicians.The contract for the eagerly anticipated scheme was awarded to specialist engineering company Dawson WAM based in Carryduff, with the scheme designed to reduce the flood risk to over  homes and businesses.In August last year, a signicant number of homes in the Bryansford Road, Bryansford Avenue, Larchfield, Shimna Road, Shimna Vale and Bryansford Gardens areas in the resort were affected by flood water.Heavy rain from Storm Francis mdash in tandem with a high tide mdash led to severe flooding with many residents forced out of their homes after the ground floors in their respective properties were submerged.Work on the flood alleviation scheme, which is expected to take around one year to complete, and will involve the construction of new flood walls emanating from the Bryansford Road bridge with the anticipatedof new flood defences in the region of , metres.The project has also slightly been remodelled following Storm Francis in order to mitigate the danger of fallen trees and other debris finding their way into the Shimna River which contributed to the flooding of homes further downstream last year.In addition, creative solutions such as totem poles in the river bed have been included in the design.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin are pleased that work on the multi-million pound scheme started on Monday.ldquoNews that work has started is welcome and people are well acquainted with the importance of the delivery of this scheme and the speed with which things have moved is a real testament to the leadership shown by the Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon and her officials, said Mr McGrath.ldquoWhen out and about in Newcastle, I get stopped by constituents eager to know how things are progressing and when they could expect the works to begin.Mr McGrath said the SDLP made a promise to those who were flooded that the party would deliver this flood alleviation scheme and has delivered on it.Cllr Devlin said communication has been crucial in the development and delivery of the scheme, starting with Mrs Mallonrsquos visit to the resort last August. She also highlighted the key role of the local resilience group which was established.She added: ldquoThe most important thing now is once this scheme is complete, some  homes in Newcastle will be protected against future flooding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe must play key role  ","story":"HEALTH chiefs have this week been urged to signicantly enhance the role of the Downe Hospital.They are being asked to build a new extension to allow the building to play an increasingly important role in the delivery of healthcare.The Down Community Health Committee has also appealed to the South Eastern Trust to accelerate theprocess of restoring all pre-Covid services to the Downpatrick hospital and ensure that this is one of theorganisationrsquos top priorities.The call comes after it was confirmed that a number of planned operations at the Downe have been cancelled over recent weeks to allow staff to be redeployed to the intensive care unit at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.Nineteen months after the local hospitalrsquos emergency department was closed temporarily as partof the health trustrsquos Covid emergency response, campaigners say it is now time for the key service to .They say that while the creation of a daytime only urgent care centre as an interim measure on the road to the restoration of the full emergency department services was welcome, the needs of the community have been clearly demonstrated and that the Downersquos previous ED must be restored.Community Health Committee chairman, Mr Eamonn McGrady, said the health trustrsquos position on emergency care for the entire East Down area, from Strangford to Newcastle and beyond, ldquois not appropriate.He declared: ldquoThe dire situation fails to meet the needs of the local community and the model of care was changed in an emergency, without the opportunity for due scrutiny and consultation with the local community. That was understandable in March , but needs to be addressed now.ldquoThe simple inadequacy of the emergency ambulance response times in this area is also a matter of grave concern. We recognise that a major element in that service failure is the y ambulance handover times that can occur at the hospitals with the centralised services.ldquoThat was to be dealt with under the Department of Healthrsquos ldquoNo More Silos document, published a full year ago. Why has that still not been addressed  he asked.Veteran hospital campaigner, Ann Trainor, has welcomed news in a letter from health officials that they are ldquoactively working on improving so-called point of care testingcapability at the Downe Hospital, which should signicantly increase service delivery in the urgent care centre.ldquoThis is good news, she continued. ldquoWe hope that progress on this will be very swt and perhaps the South Eastern Trust could explain why we are still waiting on an MRI scanner at the Downe too ldquoHoneyed words wonrsquot increase the diagnostic capability of our local hospital, one which has so much to offer on a regional basis too, but swt action will. The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision. That work must be done now and urgently and hand-in-hand with the creation of new medical workforce capacity.ldquoIt is time to build for the future and it is time for all the political parties to vigorously pursue this new investment for the Downe, the peoplersquos hospital. The people expect politicians to deliver and deliver now.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed that due to the pressures of Covid-, a small number of theatre lists at the Downe Hospital had to be cancelled in the past two weeks in order to provide staff support in the Intensive Care Unit at the Ulster Hospital.ldquoPatients who unfortunately had their procedures postponed have been rescheduled or have already had their procedures at another site in the South Eastern Trust area, she confirmed.The spokeswoman said a normal theatre schedule will resume as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Arts.jpg","title":"Downpatrick Arts Society event in St Patrick Centre  ","story":"LADY Margaret Ritchie joined members of Downpatrick Art Society as the grouprsquos st exhibition got underway at the St Patrickrsquos Centre.Over  paintings are on show encompassing a range of styles and themes, with many of the works inspired by local landscapes, while other paintings have stories to tell.Other paintings depict faraway shores to dream about and there are a few abstract works too ndash so therersquos something for everyone.The exhibition allows the artists to share their joy of painting with the public and indeed many of the paintings can be purchased to be enjoyed at home or as a gt for someone.The Society began over  years ago with four founding members and has continued to flourish as this yearrsquos exhibition proves.Prior to the Covid- lockdown, the Society enjoyed demonstrations and critiques by professional artists as well as outings and social activities and it is hoped toto these activities as the restrictions ease.Those who love painting or drawing and would like to join the Art Society should call    or leave their contact details at the reception desk in the St Patrickrsquos Centre.The new exhibition runs until the end of October between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Park.jpg","title":"East Down runners enjoy Castlewellan parkrun fun  ","story":"AFTER the huge efforts at the ious marathons last weekend, many runners were justiably taking their ease this weekend so it made for a quiet weekend on the racing front.Some East Down AC members saw this as a good opportunity to stay close to home by taking part in the Castlewellan parkrun.This is a free weekly K timed run and anyone can take part whether they belong to a club or not.If you want to appear in the results you must first obtain a bar code online at https:www.parkrun.org.uk register  and then turn up in good time for the .am start.There are around  dferent parkrun locations in Northern Ireland with new events being set up all the time.Castlewellan can claim to be one of the most scenic and it attracted  plus participants on Saturday past and whether the EDAC runners enjoyed their morning exercise or the post run refreshments more is up for debate.Ollie Robinson was first EDAC runner home possibly to ensure he had the pick of the goodies, while others were happy to run easy while taking in the beauty of the lake and trail.As promised there was ample coffee and homemade cake at the finish for our club runners and we were more than happy to share with other passers by.We may even have acquired the odd new member or two so all in all it was a successful day out. The idea is to visit a iety of locations in the months ahead.At the same time as some were having a leisurely lsquocupparsquo, three EDAC members had donned their red and yellow vests ready to take on the Cooley Coast K in Carlingford.Patrick Smith reported back that the weather was kind, the first eight kilometres was gentle and almost flat, but the last two gave them their moneyrsquos worth with a steady climb back to the finish line at the Cooley Kickhamrsquos GAC grounds.He managed to complete it in a time of .which put him in well inside the top half of the field of .Kelly Smith was ahead of him up the road as she stormed to a . which took a full minute off her previous best time.She was fth female overall which should really boost her confidence to no end.

Well done Kelly.Aine Grant who has settled in well to the club was doing her first K since Jimmyrsquos Ten in June and was well pleased to finish in  minutes. They all said that they would recommend this as a race to others in the club.Aaron McGrady had another good day on the hills on Saturday. He seems to flourish when there is hardship.He was out wearing his EDAC vest with pride at the Bradwell Fell Race in the centre of the Peak District.Not an easy one as it comprises eight kilometres and m of climbing with a profile of three steep climbs early in the race, a rolling circuit for a few km on the fell top and then a final steepdescent to the village.The conditions on Saturday were misty and cool on the tops but good for running and helped by a well marked course.The race set off fast into the first climb and Aaron settled back in and around tenth, hoping to work his way forward on the climbs.Over the top of the first climb, there were three main contenders with Aaron one of them.He took the lead on the way over the second climb and managed to put in a hard burst over the top and down the second descent.When he couldnrsquot hear the sound of the others breathing, he knew he had created a good gap so he relaxed a little on the third climb to gather some energy for the loop on the top.He was reasonably confident that he had built about a  second lead when he reached the final descent, but he gave it a good rattle anyway crossing the finish line with well over a minute to spare.Great pacing and a pleasing result.This weekend sees the Cross Country season taking the headlines with the NI Mastersrsquo Trials at Queenrsquos Playing Fields.Entries for this are now closed but those who are taking part will be vying for selection for the upcoming Home Countries event in November.Plenty of others will also be planning some off road training in order to prepare for the Bobby Rea XC which is the week after.It is great to see some recent recruits adding their name to the team entry and hopefully they will enjoy their first experience of lsquothe muckrsquo.

Concerns came not just from across the political spectrum but from groups including the Rural Community Network.”He added: “I am glad Nichola Mallon has taken this action, eventhe problem should never have arisen in the first place.”Sinn Fein MLA Cathal Boylan, meanwhile, have also welcomed the u-turn.“This was the right decision as the Minister’s plan was clearly out of step with the needs for rural communities,” he said.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Partition was the inevitable outcome of the irreconcilable aspirations of the two major groups on the island – the more than three million who saw themselves as Irish, not British, and who demanded independence, and the almost one million unionists concentrated in the north east who saw themselves as British and resolutely refused either to leave the United Kingdom or become part of an independent Irish state. In other words, Ireland was partitioned in  for the same reasons Yugoslavia was partitioned in  – that is there was no basis for unity. In Belfast in May , Parnell delivered a speech in which he declared: “It is undoubtedly true … that until the prejudices of the minority, whether reasonable or unreasonable, are conciliated … Ireland can never enjoy perfect freedom, Ireland can never be united.”One may baulk at the word “prejudices” but the important point is that nationalists have never sought to put forward a prospectus that was remotely attractive to unionists.

I have a particular problem with butter balls. They are horrible, liable to crack your jaw and I remember a now long dearly departed aunt repeatedly sucking on them at church, and offering me one to sweeten a tedium I knew could only be endured with stony faced compliance.There is no amount of sexy or stylish or slick advertising, not even a nationwide campaign with Kate Moss sporting one between her teeth, that could bring back the butter ball in any way that would ever make it fashionable or appealing again to those beneath octogenarian status.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak..

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why. What did I want from le  What was important to me  I had no idea.Ms Hall, who has three daughters ndash aged , , and one ndash began to lose interest in herself and others and stopped taking care of herself she isolated herself and drank too much alcohol, trying to hide from le.She was getting ill but thought it would pass. Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book. I hope it helps one or more people ndash I had to hit a wall to get help, but you donrsquot have to do that!Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work is available at Grfin Books in Penarth and online via Amazon.Itrsquos had positive feedback which you can read at https:amzn.to vqNVbuGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
