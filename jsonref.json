But I did, and this moment we’re in – there’s something magical about it.‘So yes, my heart is probably always going to long, and my mind is always going to look forward, but I’m also going to give it my all to not overlook these moments we’re living.‘And tonight, I think I’ll stay here with you for just a while longer.’Casey’s Facebook post sums up how a lot of parents feel, and it’s been flooded with comments from other parents struggling to balance appreciating the moment, missing the past, and looking forward to the future.‘Never wish for time to go by,’ wrote one commenter. ‘I remember it like yesterday when the last of my three children closed that door I would have given anything to have them safe in their beds every night to tuck them in.‘So yes hold them tighter and enjoy having them under your wing because time goes by like a whisper in the wind.’‘When they left my nest, it was hard letting them go, but I had to trust that I did a good job raising them, and so I gave them my blessings to begin life on their own but to always know there’s no place like home, and mom’s door and arms will always greet them with love and open hearted.’MORE: Taking inspiration from Ikea products is the next big baby-naming trendMORE: How I found my identity as a mixed race womanMORE: Mum wakes up to find two-year-old has completely destroyed her makeup"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/06/13/4AE0F3CD00000578-0-image-a-268_1523016536402.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles friend Gina Nelthorpe Cowne reveals Harry romance","story":"    In two years working together, Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne (right), 52, and Meghan Markle (left), 36, travelled the world for corporate and charity events, enjoying the best restaurants, taking selfies and exchanging intimate anecdotesShe was right, which is not surprising because Gina was the colleague, companion and confidante of the woman who will shortly become the newest and most glamorous member of the Royal Family.In two years working together, Gina, 52, and Meghan Markle travelled the world for corporate and charity events, enjoying the best restaurants, taking selfies and exchanging intimate anecdotes.Today, just weeks before the May 19 wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, Gina pays tribute to 36-year-old Meghan, who she describes as unique in her determination to succeed.Gina is one of only a handful of people who know the inside story of the whirlwind courtship between Meghan and Harry and her account of their romance, by turns candid and affectionate, is compelling.Meghan\u0027s dress-down Friday!

Speaking in her London office – a converted warehouse on the Chelsea embankment overlooking the Thames – Gina is clearly fond of Meghan, and it is easy to see why the two women had such a strong connection.A self-made entrepreneur and businesswoman with an easy charm and piercing green eyes, she worked as a model before moving from her native South Africa to Britain, where she had connections, including her brother-in-law, BBC journalist John Simpson.Gina and her husband Mark established Kruger Cowne Talent Management and today, more than 20 years on, their clients include Sir Richard Branson, Cher and Elle Macpherson. She has spent decades rubbing shoulders with celebrities, yet Meghan has made a lasting impression.It started with the first time they met in October 2014, when Gina and Kruger Cowne were working with the One Young World conference, a youth summit to inspire 18 to 30-year-olds – and Meghan, who was starring in US legal drama Suits, expressed a keen interest in becoming involved.\u0027When I arrived at Meghan\u0027s hotel room, her then boyfriend, Toronto chef Cory Vitiello, opened the door.

We were both extremely excited. \u0027I jokingly asked if she knew what she was letting herself in for and she said: \u0027Well, it\u0027s going to be an experience and at least it will be a fun night.\u0027\u0027After the date, she was telling me what a great guy he was, a real gentleman, genuinely nice, and when I asked if she would see him again she said: \u0027Well, it looks like it.\u0027 \u0027In fact, Harry asked her out again the next day and after just a few dates, invited Meghan to join him at a secret hideaway in Botswana. There, he escorted her on her first wildlife safari. For Harry, the location held a special significance: Prince Charles took him and his brother William to Africa shortly after the death of Princess Diana.On their return, Meghan told Gina how they had stayed in a tent with spectacular views and had bonded over a shared love of wildlife and conservation.\u0027I\u0027m sure that the Botswana trip is what clinched the deal,\u0027 says Gina.\u0027I knew that would do it for them – Africa has that effect.

The terrorists claimed to have destroyed four Syrian military aircraft. In February this year,  Israel\u0027s Air Force launched an attack on the airbase, destroying the main observation tower, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.In came after, Israel accused Iranian forces at the T-4 base of sending a drone into Israeli territory. Israel has previously accused Damascus of allowing Iran to set up a complex at the base to supply arms to its ally, Lebanon\u0027s Shi\u0027ite Hezbollah. The base was used by the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s for the occasional deployment of naval aircraft.

It initially reported the strike as a \u0027suspected US attack\u0027 but later withdrew all references to the United States. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the country\u0027s conflict, said 14 fighters had been killed, including Iranian forces allied to the country\u0027s regime.Forces from Russia and Iran, as well as fighters from the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, are known to have a presence at the base, said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman.No Russian specialists present in Syria were injured in the attack, Moscow\u0027s defence ministry said. Israel has previously accused Damascus of allowing Iran to set up a complex at the base to supply arms to its ally, Lebanon\u0027s Shi\u0027ite Hezbollah.Monday\u0027s statements were unusual for Russia, which has generally been reticent about Israeli strikes in Syria even as it tries to shore up President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s rule.Russia and Israel set up a hotline in 2015 to prevent accidental clashes between their forces in Syria, and diplomatic sources on both sides say Moscow is willing to turn a blind eye to Israeli actions as long as they do not destabilise Damascus.Israel rarely acknowledges strikes in Syria but has said that, as a matter of policy, they aim to thwart the entrenchment of Iranian forces or arms transfers to Hezbollah.The Pentagon said this morning that it was not carrying out strikes in Syria \u0027at this time\u0027 while French military officials told AFP: \u0027It was not us\u0027.Last year, the U.S. launched several dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base after a chemical attack in the northern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun killed dozens of people.

Another activist, Bilal Abou Salah, said a large, yellow cylinder smashed through the roof of an apartment building and came to rest on the third floor and started to discharge gas.The Syrian Civil Defense group documented 42 fatalities but was impeded from searching further by strong odors that gave rescuers difficulties breathing, said Siraj Mahmoud, a spokesman for the group.A joint statement by the civil defense group and the medical society said that more than 500 people, mostly women and children, were brought to medical centers complaining of difficulty breathing, foaming at the mouth and burning sensations in the eyes. Some had bluish skin, a sign of oxygen deprivation.The symptoms were consistent with chemical exposure. One patient, a woman, had convulsions and pinpoint pupils, suggesting exposure to a nerve agent, the statement said.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights issued a higher death toll, saying at least 80 people were killed in Douma, including around 40 who died from suffocation. But it said the suffocations were the result of shelters collapsing on people inside them.

The OPCW has destroyed 100 percent of all the country\u0027s declared toxic stockpiles, but Uzumcu has repeatedly said there were gaps in the declaration by the Syrian regime.The convention bans the use, development, production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons.          Dozens were killed and others left gasping for air in the alleged attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus on SaturdayBut amid \u0027persistent allegations\u0027 of their use in Syria, the OPCW set up its own independent fact-finding mission in 2014. It has investigated more than 70 cases of alleged toxic gas attacks in Syria since 2014.In 2015 the OPCW joined with the UN to form a joint investigative panel, known as the JIM, tasked with identifying those behind the chemical attacks in Syria.In October, the panel released a damning report that found the Syrian air force had dropped sarin on the rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhun in April 2017, killing scores of people.Yet another recent OPCW report concluded that sarin was used in another incident on March 30 in the village of Latamneh.The Syrian regime has also been blamed for using chlorine gas on three villages in 2014 and 2015. The Islamic State jihadist group was found to have unleashed mustard gas.Russia used its veto power twice in November to block the renewal of the panel, maintaining it was biased and unprofessional.Meanwhile, the European Union is squarely laying the blame for the latest suspected poison gas attack with Syrian President Bashar Assad\u0027s government.EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said that over the weekend and early Monday as the reports came in of another atrocity in Syria, the EU \u0027learned from several sources\u0027 to shape its conviction \u0027that it is the Syrian regime which is responsible\u0027 when it comes to the suspected chemical attack.          President Hassan Rouhani (centre) this morning told the U.S. president that the Iranian response would be stronger than he thinks - and would be acted out \u0027within a week\u0027\u0027Iran will not violate the nuclear deal, but if the United States withdraws from the deal, they will surely regret it. Our response will be stronger than what they imagine and they would see that within a week.\u0027Iran has warned that it would ramp up its nuclear programme if the JCOPA collapses, to achieve a more advanced level than before the deal.Rouhani was speaking as Tehran marked National Nuclear Technology Day and unveiled what it said were its latest nuclear achievements including a nuclear battery and centrifuges for the oil industry.France, Britain and Germany are seeking to persuade their EU partners to back new sanctions on Iran, mainly on its missile programme, as a way to persuade Trump to stick with the nuclear deal that put curbs on Iran\u0027s nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.                                                      Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait have also condemned the alleged chemical attack.In separate statements issued Sunday night the Gulf countries did not assign blame for the suspected attack, which the United States and France have pinned on the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\u0027Saudi Arabia is deeply concerned and condemns the horrific chemical attack,\u0027 the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, quoting a foreign ministry official.Bahrain denounced the alleged attack as \u0027ugly\u0027 and stressed \u0027the need to speed up efforts to protect civilians in every part of Syria\u0027.In Doha, Qatar\u0027s foreign ministry said it was \u0027deeply shocked by this crime\u0027.\u0027The impunity of war criminals in Syria has led to further atrocities and undermined efforts to achieve justice for the victims,\u0027 it added.An official at Kuwait\u0027s foreign ministry said the number of casualties in Douma was \u0027painful\u0027 and he called for \u0027rapid action by the international community\u0027.   By AFP and MailOnline reporterIsrael blamed for airstrike in Syria after suspected Ghouta chemical weapon attack"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/04/4AF792E700000578-5593043-image-a-54_1523243959804.jpg","title":"Ronda Rousey wins debut WWE match","story":"    Ronda Rousey has found her groove in the world of professional wrestling, winning her WWE debut on Sunday night in front of a roaring crowd           Rousey was matched up with Kurt Angle in a mixed tag team match against Triple H and Stephanie McMahon at WrestleMania 34          Rousey and Angle held up their arms in victory after winning the 20-minute match \u0027I feel absolutely ecstatic,\u0027 Rousey said after the match. \u0027After my wedding day, this is my favorite day of my life I think.\u0027 Rousey, 31, first hinted she would attend the New Orleans event with a surprise appearance at Royal Rumble in January. It was then that Rousey revealed she was committing to the WWE full-time.  \u0027This is my life now,\u0027 she said at the time. \u0027This is not a smash and grab, this is not a publicity stunt.\u0027 And that decision was clearly working well for Rousey as she took on McMahon on Sunday night, nabbing the win after using her signature armbar move.           Rousey  took on McMahon on Sunday night, nabbing the win at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans after using her signature armbar move          Rousey spent most of the night on the offensive, delivering numerous punches and several throws - including the \u0027exploder suplex\u0027Rousey spent most of the night on the offensive, delivering numerous punches and several throws - including the \u0027exploder suplex\u0027, according to Yahoo!

But I personally have always felt that liberal values are more important than which particular vehicle is carrying them at any particular time.\u0027 \u0027I think other people - whether it\u0027s liberals or liberal Conservatives should always be open to doing what they think is right and consistent with their values rather than being high bound by whatever political tribe they are in.\u0027          Simon Franks is said to be frustrated with political ision in light of the Brexit vote and the lurch left of the Labour partySir Nick denied claims he is being lined up as a possible leader.    Other  mooted as a figurehead have included David Miliband.His brother Ed is close to Mr Franks, who acted as his business adviser when he was Labour leader. Simon Franks was not at home today to discuss plans for a new centrist political party. He is yet to give any interviews and has not used social media to discuss the plans. At their £3.8million mansion in Hampstead, north London, his wife Carolyn refused to talk about her husband\u0027s new venture.She said: \u0027Simon is not here, I know nothing about it and I am not prepared to comment sorry.\u0027 Mr Franks and his wife live in a huge property behind black gates. The mansion is set back from the road by a long driveway.The former banker, who worked for JP Morgan and Paribas, quit and set up the Redbus film distribution business in his bedroom.In 2005 he sold the company, which distributed Bend it Like Beckham, to US distributor Lions Gate for £19.9million.He also helped set up a DVD rental company called Video Island, which would later become LoveFilm. This would then be sold on to Amazon for £200million before being shut down last year.Describing his journey Mr Franks said previously: \u0027I got a job in banking which was fascinating and terrible and I saw lots of great people get trapped in the system of just being addicted to the money.\u0027When David Bowie ran out of money and securitised his music rights I thought wow what a great idea, I\u0027m going to do that for film rights\u0027.          Mr Franks was not at his North London home today and is yet to speak out about the \u0027centrist\u0027 party claims in the ObserverUp to £50million has been pumped into the project with a former Labour benefactor at the helm hoping to \u0027break the Westminster mould\u0027.He has had full-time staff on the project for about year after starting initial discussion in 2016. His company - Project One Movement for the UK - is said to be a probable vehicle for the scheme.But there is reportedly consensus that candidates will run in the 2022 General Election if the movement decides the current system is defunct. The identities of those involved remain secret, other than Franks, but a source said they are ready to challenge \u0027our current crop or professional politicians\u0027.  But another person familiar with the scheme said: \u0027They have the resources, but I\u0027m not sure they have a viable plan.\u0027Others named online as possible backers include Richard Reed, founder of Innocent Smoothies.Mr Reed, who was one of three Cambridge University graduates who founded Innocent at the age of 26 in 1999 before selling it to Coca-Cola for £320million, donated to the Lib Dems in 2015. He is also a friend of Nick Clegg\u0027s.  The movement is aiming to take back the centre ground as Jeremy Corbyn, pictured, takes the party in a left-wing direction and Theresa May, right, leads the Tory government           David Owen (pictured) and the Social Democratic Party of the 1980s took just 23 seats despite winning 2.8million votes in the 1983 General Election Politicians who have made successful centrist snatches include French president Emmanuel Macron, whose En Marche! movement delivered a majority in the national assembly last year.Critics of Franks\u0027 project point to the Social Democratic Party of the 1980s, when four senior Labour politicians formed a liberal alliance that took only 23 seats despite netting 7.8million votes in 1983\u0027s General Election. However the plans for a centrist challenger party were dismissed by the shadow chancellor and two of his frontbench colleagues.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: \u0027That\u0027s a novel idea. A party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. A party for the few not the many.\u0027Shadow health and social care secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \u0027For goodness sake, what a daft waste of time. Anyone putting money into this nonsense would be better off investing in our campaign to restore and rebuild our NHS.\u0027Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, tweeted: \u0027A new political party with £50m in the kitty, no members, no rule book, no ideology.

However, polling of almost 800 company directors by the IoD found the EU has provided stronger growth for British firms selling goods overseas than Asia or North America over the past two years. Business leaders see potential in these regions in the next five years, according to the poll, but the EU remains the area with the highest expectations for growth.Allie Renison of the IoD warned ministers to “get real about trade, and fast” as the statistics showed how important the EU was for British firms. “Going global is as much about opportunities in Europe as it is further afield, and this should be reflected in how the government shapes post-Brexit Britain,” she said.Amanda Murphy, the head of commercial banking for HSBC UK, said: “Undeterred by future post-EU uncertainty, businesses clearly aim to capitalise on the cheaper pound and rising demand in key markets to boost their overseas sales.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79bd64c2e5f28bd2fcc42585e9a7499eb14e7985/0_374_5217_3131/master/5217.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=244838e590a1e2e6fd2297afba61538a 2600w","title":"the struggle for melbourne has the worlds most liveable city lost its way","story":"Plonking an Apple store in Melbourne’s biggest civic square has caused a long-simmering debate about the future of Australia’s most progressive city to boil overIn Melbourne’s Federation Square, people are sitting on the steps, eating lunch among the pigeons under a sky that threatens drizzle. The cascading crazy paving and interlocking sandstone facades supposedly, in the architects’ vision at least, represent the desert heart of Australia. Across the road, a banner hangs from the walls of St Paul’s Cathedral: “Let’s fully welcome refugees.” Melissa, an academic, walks out of the Koorie Heritage Trust, housed in the Yarra building on the square’s south side. It is due to be demolished to make room for a “flagship” Apple store, under plans announced by the state government a few months ago out of the blue and without public consultation.The proposal for the jarring two-storey pagoda, dubbed “the Pizza Hut” by critics, was met with a fury that is hard to over-estimate. Petitions were started. Public debates were held.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Melissa is “very, very upset” about Apple intruding in this public place. “This is a nice spot for people to be.”When Federation Square opened in 2002, it was a shock: uneven surfaces, all angles and scant greenery. Oh so modern, and so out of place alongside the elegant, establishment Melbourne of the 1910 Flinders Street railway station and St Paul’s Cathedral across the road.But like everything about Melbourne – a bar you stumble upon, your favourite barista, exuberant street art in tiny laneways – Fed Square grows on you. Film star and Melburnian Chris Hemsworth has said it is a “mellower Times Square, where all paths seem to lead”.It attracts 10 million visitors a year, two million more than the Sydney Opera House. Locals and tourists have embraced it as a place to both protest and celebrate. It is a civic place: an old-fashioned term that somehow captures something indefinable about the city.It was here that more than 150,000 people protested the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the biggest anti-war gathering in the country since the Vietnam war. We come together to share events on the big screen – World Cup soccer, the Australian Tennis grand slam, and especially Australian Rules Football, the free-flowing game we follow obsessively. We take free dancing lessons and meet friends, or swarm to catch a glimpse of Oprah.If Melbourne is going through a wobbly moment – and it surely is – you can sense it here. For a city weighed down by its gong as the “world’s most liveable city” for seven years straight, it’s uneasy about where it’s going, uncertain whether it wants to be a global megacity doubling its population to eight million by midcentury, or hang on to its charms. The city has been through many booms and busts since its European foundation in 1835 but, as urban historian Graeme Davison puts it, one of the threads through its history has been a quaint sense of civic values an idea of a shared purpose beyond commerce and getting ahead.Davison is the author of The Rise and Fall of Marvellous Melbourne, chronicling the heady days after the Gold Rush in the 1850s. This was a time when Melbourne swaggered – it was reputedly the richest city in the world and the fastest growing. Davison says the city has always been a pragmatic, commercial place – it was settled by land speculators, after all – but from its earliest days Melbourne had a strong streak of public benevolence. A site for the city’s glorious English-style botanic gardens was picked barely a decade after it was founded. A few years on, its early leaders thought to establish what would become the National Gallery of Victoria, the first major art gallery in the country.“On the whole Melbourne has been that kind of city, but I sense a danger to it now,” says Davison.There are many strands to that danger: astonishing population growth – the fastest of any capital in the country – and rising inequality, epitomised by housing prices beyond the reach of ordinary wage earners (houses have a median price tag of more than $AU 900,000 – though Melbourne remains cheaper than Sydney, which tops $1m).It has become a two-tiered city, with cosmopolitan Melburnians living near transport and cultural facilities, and the neglected fringe dwellers sitting in traffic for hours to get to work. Then there is the fury over Federation Square, and the idea that the public’s sense of ownership of it may be lost.Davison was so dismayed about the Apple announcement he wrote an article for The Conversation website. “It would not occur to the average Briton to ask whether Trafalgar Square is paying for itself, much less to install an Apple store beside Nelson’s Column,” he wrote. “Isn’t it time we grew up and recognised that not everything that is important to our collective life has a price? That commercial values do not trump civic ideals?”It was a “plea from the heart” to recognise that the idea of “civic good” is threaded through Melbourne’s history and is central to the city’s character, says Davison.Unlike New South Wales (NSW), Queensland and Tasmania, the state of Victoria was never a penal colony and Melbourne was never a convict town. The Gold Rush made it a boomtown: optimistic, modern, and seductive to so many people dreaming of gold that its population soared from 29,000 to 169,000 in a decade. Then in the 1890s came the crash and the depression a slump in wealth and confidence from which it only gradually recovered. Melbourne’s leaders were often different to those in other places in Australia, says Davison: progressive, looking to the long-term. This was the city of Alfred Deakin, a progressive liberal crucial to Australian federation, and later prime minister of H B Higgins, the judge who brought down the famous Harvester decision, which guaranteed wages high enough for “a human being in a civilised community”.“All those people articulated common values in Melbourne,” says Davison. “Melbourne had a character that tended to draw people to the middle politically.”For much of last century, Melbourne was the most establishment of places, known as the jewel of the Australian conservative party’s crown. It was censorious. Pubs shut at six, because that was good for all of us, leading to the famous “six o’clock swill”, where boozers would down as many as they could before closing time. It was – and remains – the private school capital of Australia.But a few decades ago, Melbourne threw off its staid image. Mass immigration after the second world war shook it up, and clever planning brought the central business district to life. The Postcode 3000 campaign that began in the 1990s is considered an international lesson in how to revitalise city centres that hollow out after the work day ends. About 150,000 people now live in central Melbourne, and high-rise apartments house people, as well as offices. More people brought more nightlife and cafes, and old laneways – once a dumping ground for trash – were transformed into hidden gems.Along the way Melbourne has become the most politically progressive city in Australia. If it were up to Melburnians, Australia would already be a republic and have negotiated a treaty with Indigenous Australians.Even Melbourne’s conservatives tend to be small “l” liberals at heart. The radio shock-jocks of Sydney are disdained by Melburnians, who would rather debate than shout.The city was transformed in large part by the astonishing influx of immigrants after the second world war – many from the UK, but tens of thousands from Italy and Greece, as well as displaced East European Jews. Then in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese immigrants came.Melbourne is in now in another people boom, with around 120,000 new residents settling in the city each year, and record immigration from China and India.Population growth is the conversation Melburnians are having – or want to have, if political parties would engage. The political editor of the Age newspaper, Josh Gordon, articulated the unease last year when he wrote that the pace was unsustainable: “It’s time to accept that Melbourne has, over the past decade, lost much of its coveted liveability and no longer deserves the title.” Melbourne is headed towards a population of five million and is predicted to overtake Sydney as Australia’s most populous metropolis by the 2030s. Its growth is dizzying, and the city is groaning with it.The state government is trying hard now to provide the infrastructure needed. Cars crawl through city streets dug up for the biggest public transport project Victoria has ever undertaken: the $11bn Metro underground railway project that will add stations and ease bottlenecks. The problem is that it won’t open until 2025, by which time the city will have added another million people.High demand for housing is one reason prices are out of reach for many. “If we keep going with city rents and prices the way we are, we’ll end up in a city where only the very rich will be able to live,” says Independent mayoral candidate Sally Warhaft. “The people who make the city tick will be forced further and further away.”Davison says he worries about the pervading political message that there is no alternative to rapid growth. “There is a legitimate argument about how big the city can be, and how big is should be. Just to take it for granted that this is irresistible is a mistake.”We meet for lunch in Box Hill, a suburb about 20km east of the city centre that is a designated “activity centre” – which means it is slated for growth. Once a conservative, white middle class house-and-garden suburb, it remains one of the few quaint spots in Melbourne that is “dry”. There are no pubs or clubs, and restaurants cannot serve alcohol – although that is slowly and quietly changing.Davison has no problem with areas being earmarked for fast growth, but fears that what is being lost is Melbourne’s character: its sense of connectedness, of civic good. More prosaically, Melbourne is one of the lowest-density cities in the world – a great sprawling place. Davison says that it might seem an outdated, 20th-century notion now, but putting space between people made city living less irritating and more comfortable.”People move here because it gives them a chance to own a house – you can buy a three-bedroom place for $450,000. Among the incomers are thousands of immigrants, especially from India. Ninety babies are born a week – its mayor, Peter Maynard, knows the statistics by heart. Wyndham is a terrific place to live, he says – “people say g’day in the street” – but it has its strains. For the first time, the council has put up temporary, demountable buildings to house kindergarten children because demand is too high to wait for permanent structures.“We’ve got about 26 kindergartens now, and we still need another 26 in the next 17 years,” says Maynard. “We need 20 primary schools and five secondary schools. Build us five primary schools yesterday and we’d fill them already.”One of Wyndham’s claims to fame is that it has the highest proportion of people in the country spending two or more hours a day in traffic travelling to and from work. #nightmarecommute was the hashtag used to document the area’s transport woes on the inaugural western suburbs’ “National Nightmare Commute Day” last year. Across Melbourne there is angst about infrastructure, and governments are scrambling to catch up. Even with all the road and public transport work going on, it is estimated that half of all car trips in peak hour will be congested in two decades, up from a third now. There are murmurings in Australia’s most successful multicultural city that perhaps immigration should slow for a while to allow everyone to take a breath for a few more schools to be built, for public transport to improve, for housing costs to settle a little. Former New South Wales premier Bob Carr has called Australia’s rate of population growth – far higher than in comparable countries – a “weird experiment”. Sydney is also struggling to cope, but nowhere is that struggle so obvious as it is in Melbourne. Does Melbourne want to be a city of eight million people? If so, will it lose its connectedness, its civic values, of common purpose? Does it have a choice?Davison’s phrase “Marvellous Melbourne” has often been cited with pride, but just as often with irony. How marvellous that young people can barely afford a house. How marvellous that people living in outer suburbs spend weeks of their lives stationary in traffic. How marvellous that homelessness is on the rise.The “world’s most liveable city” is used ironically too, at least among many locals. The Economist Intelligence Unit has declared Melbourne to be so for seven years, a record, taking into account safety, health care, education, infrastructure and the environment.The Economist’s index is a corporate thing – a guide for companies sending their executive staff overseas. Politicians boast about it. “This world record is an amazing feat that all Melburnians should be extremely proud of today,” the-then mayor said last year, but those here roll their eyes. Travelling corporate executives will not live in Melbourne’s outer suburbs, or struggle to afford the rent, or spend weeks of their lives stuck on freeways.It’s telling that the Economist notes that cities that score best tend to be mid-sized, in wealthy countries with low population density. The city that came second last year was Vienna, with 1.8 million people, then Vancouver with 2.5 million. “These can foster a range of recreational activities without leading to high crime levels or overburdened infrastructure,” the Economist says.Any bigger and people pay the price in crime, strained transport and inequality. Perhaps they lose touch with each other, too.Back at Federation Square, it’s worth visiting the gallery of Australian art. It contains one of the most famous paintings of Melbourne: John Brack’s Collins St, 5pm. It’s Melbourne in the 1950s, and portrays dull workers leaving their offices and heading home to the suburbs. Every person faces the same way, their countenances drawn and unsmiling, a picture of dreary conformity.Melbourne is nothing like that now. It’s lively and feisty, comfortable with its ersity and confident in its creativity. It’s just that it’s changing – again – very fast. It might turn out to be marvellous, of course. Or what makes it special might may swept away, without us noticing until it’s too late.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

But will it work?Poet Kenneth Slessor called it a “dispersed and vaguer Venice” journalist John Birmingham, a “Leviathan”. From its earliest days, Sydney has wrestled with its history as an “unplanned” but naturally blessed city, where unchecked development competes with liveability and beauty.It was only in the late 1980s, when the tourist industry poured millions of dollars into “brand Sydney”, that the balance tipped towards the beautiful and it began its current life as a place of lifestyle and spectacle, where the annual New Year’s Eve fireworks, stretching along its once-industrial harbour past the Opera House, attract 1.6 million people each year. Over these last decades, Sydney has projected an image to the world of a brash, relaxed and confidently lovely city, where locals are just as likely as tourists to embrace its restaurants-with-a-view or paid climbs over the Harbour Bridge. But that self-image that Sydney has held on to so fiercely since then is teetering in the face of accelerated growth. Parks and streetscapes are being destroyed for major highway extensions, and new apartment complexes tower over old low-rise housing. Suburbs that have been left to sprawl for decades, especially at the city’s edges, are coming up hard against a lack of infrastructure. The result is a metropolis as car-centred as Los Angeles for the majority of its residents, with one of the 10 highest costs of living in the world where unaffordable house prices dominate conversation, schools are overcrowded, workers commute long distances, and public transport breaks down when it rains. In the last year testimonials by disenchanted residents fleeing for more liveable cities have become a new micro-genre in its newspapers: “Sydney, I love you, but you’re meaner than ever” “Why I’m leaving Sydney: the city that actively punishes people for living in it.”This inequality between centre and periphery is not peculiar to Sydney. It is also part of a global trend, in which populations are deserting leafier areas for the attractions of a denser inner city. At the same time, local history compounds the challenges Sydney faces: its notorious battle between chaos and control dates back to tensions between the convicts who built their own higgledy-piggledly houses on the cliffs to the west of the city’s early water source, and the colonial administrators to the east. “A city without a plan, save whatever planning was due to an errant goat,” was how town planning advocate J D Fitzgerald described Sydney in 1917. That is the context into which the Greater Sydney Commission (GSC) has just released its strategic regional plan, a vision for how the city can smooth those lines out over the next 40 years of growth and deliver the benefits more equally. It presents the region’s rapid expansion as an opportunity for “transformative urban renewal” that, if proactively harnessed, starting now, could ensure the Sydney of the not-too-distant future remains a global city which is both culturally erse and an economic powerhouse.  The language is positive, but what it proposes is radical. It will ide Sydney from one city, into three. Under the ambitious plan for “A Metropolis of Three Cities”, Sydney is to be reshaped into three separate but linked urban centres: an Eastern Harbour City focused on the existing central business district (CBD), a Central River City at its geographical centre to the west and, further west still, the Western Parkland City. The GSC’s proposal aims to rebalance the city from its historic orientation around its original CBD and into three connected but independently flourishing cities. Ideally, most residents will live within 30 minutes of their jobs, schools, healthcare and essential services. Affordable housing and improved mass transit will stimulate investment and jobs in new economic corridors.  “I think it’s a really brave plan,” says architect and urban designer Craig Allchin, who worked on the 2005 and 2010 metropolitan strategies that preceded it. “Everyone in the urban planning world is following its development because it’s such a fundamental rethinking. “It’s trying to solve all the things we’re worried about in the city: housing affordability, liveability, demographic change, population growth, climate change.” However, while the three-city metropolis may look like an about-turn in Sydney’s traditional orientation, it has roots that predate colonisation, according to the GSC’s chief commissioner. In her introduction, Lucy Turnbull writes that the city’s redrawn boundaries reflect Indigenous people’s relationships to the land as “saltwater country” (Eastern Harbour City), “muddy river country” (Central River City), and “running water country” (Western Parkland City).  The three-city metropolis is a shared vision, writes Turnbull, “bringing the depth of Aboriginal culture and custodianship to the fore in the future planning of Greater Sydney”. But guiding such a major rethinking into reality will require unprecedented collaboration and investment from all tiers of government. The GSC plan is unusual in the level of administrative reform that has already been put in place. Most significant is the Western Sydney City Deal agreed upon by federal, state and local governments. The single largest planning, investment and delivery partnership in Australia’s history, and aimed at delivering the new airport and connecting infrastructure in the Western Parkland City, it has genuine potential to counterbalance the pull of the eastern city.  It is this third, westernmost city that is the real game-changer. With three urban centres circling a planned second airport and “aerotropolis”, its mission is to be the most connected place in Australia. The GSC claims the Western Sydney airport will act as a catalyst for a new “Western Economic Corridor”, providing 28,000 direct and indirect jobs within five years of its 2026 opening. State and federal government have committed to at least the first phase of new mass transport routes. In particular, a new rail link running through the extended airport to its north and south will act, says architect Allchin, as “a kind of spine” for the new Western Parkland City. The whole endeavour is a huge proposition, he says, because by making the west a more affordable, erse and attractive place to live, Sydney has the potential to be unique among global cities, by breaking the pull of a primary city centre. Judith Ridge is already experiencing the benefits of the “30-minute city” lifestyle envisaged by the GSC. Nearly eight years ago she moved to Windsor, an early colonial settlement on the edge of the proposed Western Parkland City, to escape the gridlock of the inner west. Working as a teacher, she is saving the $80 a week she used to spend on tolls driving to work. She says the area is changing: its older, white and working-class population has been joined by inner-city renters, a handful of queer couples, and residents originally from China and Vietnam. Here on the semi-rural Sydney outskirts, they can afford to buy “an actual house”, says Ridge. While Windsor is economically depressed compared to the gentrifying suburbs nearby, it’s also escaped the encroachment of “cheek-by-jowl, shake-hands-with-your neighbour” housing estates, she notes – and she can see the stars at night. It may not last. In a city still strongly commited to growth, the population of Western Parkland City is projected to increase from 740,000 in 2016 to well over 1.5m by 2056, transformed into a “thriving, productive and sustainable area”, starting with the 24-hour, seven-day international airport. Yet, notes Prof Robert Freestone from the department of planning at the University of New South Wales, it remains unclear if the airport will be the vaunted catalyst for an economic boom – or even if it will attract domestic or international commercial airlines or freight. He has questioned how it can be expected to compete with the established Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the big earners along the Eastern Economic Corridor Sydney Airport Group has already turned down the first option to operate it. Details of the surrounding “aerotropolis” remain sketchy. Demand for new housing will also come at the expense of the space western Sydney currently offers. With the western district due to bear the brunt of the population growth, the plan has identified a need for 184,500 new homes there by 2036, and proposes releasing large tracts of land to form new walkable neighbourhoods close to public transport. These would be made up of “a range of housing types, tenures and price points” to provide for the different needs of the community, it specifies, with view to bringing prices down. But the enormous number of new houses needed to meet demand – 725,000 across the region by 2036, a minimum of 36,250 every year – will inevitably mean knocking down huge swathes of detached buildings to make room for more apartments. This is also the case for the Eastern Harbour City, where there are just 31 people per hectare by contrast, New York City’s five boroughs have an average density of 109 people per hectare. Building more apartments “can be perfectly valid, if people are given time to think about it and be part of the process”, says Allchin, but the plan does not spell it out explicitly and so misses the opportunity to lead from the front. The GSC envisages compact and innovative forms of housing on smaller lots than the traditional suburban quarter-acre block, but Allchin worries that the overall footprints of these new buildings tend to be bigger, meaning a sacrifice of green garden space. He would like to see bolder, more imaginative planning. “Really dense housing with lots of landscape around it”, for example, could become a world-leading new Sydney model. But convincing Sydneysiders to embrace apartments will be fraught, when there is already intense local resistance to galloping high-density housing, especially in the city’s much-loved inner enclaves and leafy garden suburbs. “Marrickville, not Mirvacville” runs one local campaign, playing on the name of a major developer, and nodding to the anxiety that Sydney’s very sense of place is at stake from a perceived long history of governments’ favouring developers over residents.Few locals, reading the GSC’s plans, will be able to put aside the stories of overdevelopment and graft that are a powerful thread in the city’s mythology: the dark side of its self-image. But there are other stories the plan omits. First, there is the question of whether its population boom is in fact inevitable. And the plan largely ignores sea-rise – a failure of imagination shared by most of the world’s coastal cities, but an incongruous one, given the breezy emphasis on other measures to increase resilience and adapting to climate change threats such as extreme heat. Last year the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association predicted global sea levels could rise by two metres by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions remain at their current levels. With 500 gigalitres of harbour stretching through its centre, this is potentially enough to make catastrophically literal the Australian poet Kenneth Slessor’s charming comparison of 1950s Sydney to Venice. Yet sea-rise rates just one mention on a single page of the plan, while the state government’s draft “coastal management plan” places a soothing emphasis on “adapting” to “pressures”. While the GSC at least commits to increasing the tree canopy of western Sydney, and preserving Indigenous heritage, farmland and natural landscapes, a fully imagined future plan for Sydney might have looked backwards to before the last glacier melt 21,000 years ago, when its coast stretched 26km further to the east, and the harbour was a steep river valley.  That last inundation is still remembered in Indigenous oral history, says Dennis Foley, a professor at Canberra University and Gai-mariagal author of Repossession of Our Spirit, a personal history of the clans of Sydney’s northern beaches. Once there were eight clans, he says, but when the water rose two “never came in – so we don’t talk about them”. These days most public events in Australia begin with a “Welcome to Country” from an Indigenous person, or an “Acknowledgement of Country” as part of a growing respect for traditional ownership. “Country” is a complex term, denoting Indigenous Australians’ land, sea, sky, rivers, seasons, plants, animals, belonging, and spirituality: to speak of one’s country is to speak of place, but also a spiritual connection. “Always was, always will be Aboriginal land” has become a rallying cry for recognition of land rights. Turnbull’s attempt to root the GSC’s plan in Indigenous knowledge may appear an attempt to make the huge changes being foisted on the city by the plan sound inevitable because they are historic. But when asked if the GSC’s three city isions map onto Indigenous knowledge, Foley says they “absolutely” do, in the sense that they reflect the fact that “the Sydney basin is a mixture of fresh and saltwater law, based in matrilineal law”.Unlike the central and western Aboriginal nations across the continent, which are mostly based on a patrilineal belief system, the eastern coastal Aboriginal Nations are matrilineal. “A complicated system of traditions exists within a small geographic area that includes the Georges, Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers, where ecological convergence occurs between fresh water and salt water by natural occurring rock weirs,” says Foley. “The ecological convergence brings together two differing Aboriginal belief systems.” At the same time, he cautions against assuming a direct equivalence between Indigenous borders and the western concept of land boundaries. “For Aboriginal people, the concept of a border or ision is a moving, fluid site that can alter with natural phenomena, and the merger of Aboriginal groups due to marriage, drought, and more recently the violence and extirpation of culture by colonisation.” Prof Jakelin Troy, director of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research at the University of Sydney, says Turnbull’s three terms for country – saltwater, muddy river and running water country – are “news to her”. Aboriginal people, she says, usually talk about themselves as being from “salt”, “freshwater”, or “desert” country – or even “ice”, as her Ngarigu family’s country around the Snowy River is referred to. Nor, as far as she can remember, do these terms appear in the extinct local Sydney language, which she has revived from notebooks from the colony’s first years. Even if, Troy says cautiously, some Indigenous Sydneysiders are identifying through these terms, it would only be one of the great range of ways Aboriginal people talk about themselves after being forced to adjust territorial groupings by the violence of European invasion. The emphasis placed by both Foley and Troy on resilience in the face of great change suggests that Indigenous knowledge has a lot more to offer in guiding discussions of Sydney’s future than as an “original vision”, which, Turnbull claims, the GSC’s plan will fulfil.  A more genuine attempt to mirror the Indigenous relationship with Sydney, Troy says, would be to ask, “What is Sydney for Aboriginal people now – to ask them about caring for country and loving country, and still having sovereignty.” It may be that the greater ambition of the three-city plan is to model detachment in fast-paced and uncertain times, softening us up to change itself through abstraction. In the language of the GSC, bush becomes “open space”, suburbs are “metropolitan clusters”, and creeks “green corridors”. Even the clinical poetry of the three new city names suggests its architects are envisaging a level of change more appropriate to the world’s masterplanned new insta-cities – Tbilisi Sea New City, Abdullah Economic City in Saudi Arabia, or Singapore’s Forest City – and a future Sydney that, for all the talk of preserving its “Great Places”, will have to bid goodbye to its old self-image. Sydney has long ided itself into territories that are as much psychological as geographical, with the Eastern Suburbs standing as shorthand for “wealthy and self-involved” and the Inner West for “gentrified and left-wing” while the western suburbs – at least to outsiders – have been seen as Sydney’s disadvantaged, ethnically ided, crime ridden id. The GSC plans to drastically alter these old isions.  And yet, thanks partly to bigger changes sweeping the world, they are already giving way to new isions, especially a wider ide between rich and poor. Twenty-three kilometres west of downtown Sydney, Parramatta has been busy for some time transforming from Australia’s oldest inland city into a second metropolitan centre that will anchor the Central River City. High-rise around its large metro railway station, its long, bright streets also incorporate a convict prison, old fibro cottages and some of the colony’s earliest farms. Author Felicity Castagna lives here with her husband and two children. Once, she said, you would have been able to get the best feel for this vibrant, well-established suburb of old and new immigrants by sitting at the top of the pedestrianised main street. But now it is a hole, slated for a $2bn high-rise development of the City Square, as the city rebuilds itself around a “reactivated” river. “Even with all the new building, most work is being done by big corporations that have their own suite of people,” says Castagna, which cuts out local tradespeople. The development is not all bad – as a writer, it brings her in touch with more audiences, she says, which has been wonderful – but she mourns the working-class suburb of old. “Some of the families who live here used to have backyards – now they’re living seven to eight in apartment blocks, while apartments on the river are going for $3m.” One decked out in Versace furniture rents out for $500 a night. “You can pay extra money for people to come and serve you champagne,” she notes.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live. Castagna has set two acclaimed novels in Parramatta, and has been a member of writing groups with a mission to reclaim the western suburbs from outside perceptions of it as a cultural wasteland. Castagna says western Sydney authors wrote first from a defensive desire to shine a positive light on the region, but more recently, have “started to work towards showing western Sydney in its massive socioeconomic and religious ersity, as very modern and contemporary”. And yet, interviewers sometimes still ask her: “How will readers relate to the west?” It remains to be seen how much the Sydney of 40 years’ time resembles the one set out by the GSC. But by proposing a plan that does not focus on its postcard harbour and CBD, and investing in areas it has previously left casually to spread, A Metropolis of Three Cities may see the old imaginative boundaries of Sydney disappear forever.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Reinstating the Irish border would be an enormous setbackTwenty years ago, the Good FridayBelfast agreement helped bring an end to decades of conflict and violence in Northern Ireland. It was a watershed moment – the result of diplomatic efforts within the halls of government and extraordinary actions of ordinary women and men who reached across longstanding and bitter ides.Today, the agreement stands not only as a local framework for shared understanding, but as a shining example of what’s possible when citizens come together to demand peace, and preserve it across generations. As the world celebrates this significant anniversary, we must also remain vigilant in protecting the agreement in the face of our current challenges – from the uncertainties heralded by Brexit to the hurdles posed by the impasse in devolved government in Northern Ireland – and do all we can to deliver on the unrealised aspirations of human rights and equality that were espoused that day in April 1998.Even now, I can picture clearly my husband’s first trip to Northern Ireland as president. On a cold winter night in 1995, Bill and I joined thousands of people at Belfast city hall for the lighting of the Christmas tree. As Catholics and Protestants alike came to that spot from their deeply ided neighbourhoods, there was no guarantee that violence wouldn’t break out yet they came with a sense of hope, after so many seasons of darkness.It was on that same trip that I first met some of the women whose names are too often forgotten, despite their vital role in the agreement. One of those women was Joyce McCartan, a Catholic mother whose 17-year-old son had been shot dead by a Protestant gunman. Joyce invited me to join women from both traditions at the safe house she had set up in a local fish and chip shop. We sat around a small table, drinking tea out of an old aluminium teapot, while the women told me how they had first reached across their ides to band together to stop the price of their children’s milk from going up. Along the way, they discovered that the deep-rooted causes of the violence – the terrors of sectarianism, the burdens of poverty, the despair of unemployment – touched all of their lives. In the end, for them and for so many women across Northern Ireland, love of family ran deeper than calls to hatred.Though they may not have made the headlines or the history books, those kitchen-table conversations were essential to the peace process. So were all the women who came together to form a coalition and claim a formal seat at the table – women like Avila Kilmurray, Monica McWilliams, Pearl Sagar, May Blood and so many more who moved mountains to help negotiate the Good Friday agreement years ago at Stormont.There are some who argue that the agreement has outlived its usefulness. They are wrong. Countless people in Northern Ireland are alive today, rather than in early graves, because of it. The last thing we can afford to do is become complacent, or delude ourselves into thinking our work is finished. In fact, 20 years later, crucial components of the agreement still have yet to be implemented. An integrated education system and support for community development, the promotion of the representation of women, and a bill of rights for Northern Ireland are all promises that have yet to be realised. The fact that the Civic Forum has fallen by the wayside is especially tragic, since it would offer a venue to discuss many of the urgent issues facing Northern Ireland today, including the possible outcomes of Brexit negotiations.These are difficult times for Northern Ireland, and for our world. As the Brexit debate rages on, I continue to believe in the value of the European Union, and of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace. But no matter the outcome of these discussions, we cannot allow Brexit to undermine the peace that people voted, fought and even died for. Reinstating the border would be an enormous setback, returning to the “bad old days” when communities would once again be set apart.Two decades ago, it was acknowledged that just as the Troubles didn’t start overnight, peace was never going to come overnight. Now, as the world celebrates this significant anniversary, the principles the agreement represented in the first place are more important than ever: a commitment to peace, prosperity and healing as the people of Northern Ireland build a shared future. As Avila and Monica recently wrote, if short-term interests take precedence over solving the long-term challenges that still exist in Northern Ireland, “then it is clear that the hand of history will be both heavy and unforgiving”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dbf2cf9b331afb91155a0bd666d2a9be500afb5/0_38_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2f03814b8a26e1aa32e03f486b4175b1 1720w","title":"tech companies data online transactions friction","story":"In the pursuit of ever-faster online transactions, we have facilitated surveillance capitalism – it’s time to create some frictionWe live in an e-commerce utopia. I can call out orders and my demands are satisfied through an automated, seamless transaction. I just have to ask Alexa, or Siri, or one of the other digital assistants developed by Silicon Valley firms, who await the commands and manage the affairs of their human bosses.We’re building a world of frictionless consumerism. To see the problems with it requires you to stop and think, which itself runs against the grain of this technology. Utopia is in the eye of the beholder. One person’s utopia is another’s dystopia. Take the obese humans in Pixar’s Wall-E: never having to move from their mobile chairs with screens they use to get their food delivered to them. The point is not that Alexa will make us obese. Rather, it’s that intelligent technology can manage much more than isolated purchase orders of books, or the devices and systems in our homes. It can manage our lives, who we are and are capable of being, for better or worse.Yet there is much more to being human than the pursuit of such shallow forms of happiness. Flourishing human beings need some friction in their decision-making. Friction is resistance it slows things down. And in our hyper-rich, fast-paced, attention-deprived world, we need opportunities to stop and think, to deliberate and even second-guess ourselves and others. This is how we develop the capacity for self-reflection how we experiment, learn and develop our own beliefs, tastes and preferences how we exercise self-determination. This is our free will in action.We don’t want too much friction, either: it is, after all, costly. Paralysis by analysis is a frightening prospect. It’s easier to abandon such deliberations and accept defaults, often set by others. The insights from behavioural economics tell us we choose not to choose. This convenient “choice” is only made easier in our modern data-rich economy.Consider, for example, Facebook users’ relationship with Facebook. The relationship begins when users click through to Facebook’s sign-up page, which forms a binding legal contract and authorises Facebook’s extensive data collection and sharing practices. The transaction costs are minimal. Trust is essential. Yet it is and has been unwarranted. As the recent Cambridge Analytica debacle highlights, Facebook has enabled third parties – and there are many – to use Facebook users’ data to develop sophisticated psychological profiling and personalisation algorithms, to influence their beliefs and votes. In the end, the debacle is merely a symptom of a diseased digital networked environment optimised for frictionless data flows, advertising and e-commerce.Some digital tech cheerleaders like to describe data as “the new oil”, the raw material that will drive economic growth. But data is oil-like in more than one way: it eliminates friction and has the potential to re-engineer the environments within which we live – our workplaces, schools, hospitals and homes – so we risk becoming increasingly predictable and programmable.Consider a simple example. Modern electronic contracting often depends on a seamlessly designed human-computer interface that creates a binding contract through the simple act of clicking or tapping a virtual button. Some economists celebrate this mechanism for minimising transaction costs and eliminating friction in the formation of a contract.This view is dangerously myopic. It focuses on efficiency gains and ignores subtle but powerful impacts on human autonomy. It makes it rational for a user to blindly accept terms of use. To read the terms would be a waste of time, an irrational and futile exercise. Even if you’re a glutton for punishment, how would you choose which e-contract is worth the time and effort? After all, you enter into so many of them, and they’re spreading like wildfire, from apps and smart TVs to all the devices in your workplace, car and home that are destined – according to e-commerce gurus – to be integrated into the Internet of Things. So people just default to clicking “I agree”. This is not only a predictable response, it is arguably a programmed one.Frictionless e-contracting makes a mockery of contracting, which is premised on parties genuinely exercising their autonomy when deciding to enter into a binding legal relationship. At best, it generates the illusion of consent through automatic and even programmed behaviour. Repeat interactions with this and other similar mechanisms risk habituation to mindless clicking.One response to this social dilemma is to deliberately engineer friction into modern consumer choices – to design transaction costs into technology. How should we do this? Too much would probably cause the digital economy to grind to a halt. It needs to be more a case of introducing some digital speed bumps that prompt consumers to slow down and think about the transaction they’re about to undertake in a way that preserves their autonomy. Ways of doing this include courts refusing to enforce automatic contracts and requiring evidence of actual deliberation by consumers about the most important substantive terms of a contract. Software could require a user to scroll over the most important terms and conditions before clicking the “I agree”, or it could even require consumers to answer substantive questions about the contract.Technology enthusiasts celebrate the idea of frictionless commerce in the home with no trace of second thoughts. Consumers like instant gratification and convenience. And, of course, it’s super-exciting for the marketing folks just waiting to nudge people to make purchases.But how will such seemingly perfect transactional efficiency affect how we behave in our own homes? How might it impact our willpower? Psychologists have shown that if we anticipate feelings of regret, that can moderate our behaviour in the face of temptation. But to what degree does anticipated regret depend upon the opportunity to reflect upon one’s preferences? As convenient as it may be, we should worry about technology creating a consumer world without friction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7abc6988d4c28113b193207c20e31b488b205f75/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b1a34c71310306ce84d5e27893e59bc0 1240w","title":"aussie humour abroad comedy language lost in translation","story":"Standup stars Jordan Raskopoulos, Zoë Coombs Marr, Charlie Pickering, Nazeem Hussain and Candy Bowers on the fraught art of adapting their jokes for different cultures and languagesOn their first international tour as a young comedy band, Australia’s Axis of Awesome found themselves in the UK at the world’s biggest fringe festival. It was there they learned an important lesson for any comedian venturing abroad: comedy is contextual.“There used to be a cocktail shot called the ‘cocksucking cowboy’,” frontwoman Jordan Raskopoulos remembers. “We had a song about it, which we performed in Edinburgh.”It turned out, however, that the popularity of the drink was largely confined to Australia. Without the background knowledge, she says, “it just turned out to be a reasonably homophobic song about cowboys, with no punchline”.It was a quick learning curve for Raskopolous and her band: comedy requires a delicate process of translation and not everyone has heard of our terrible cocktails. Australia loves the story of local comedians making it big overseas – the awards in Edinburgh, the rave reviews in New York. And for the comedians themselves, it’s part of the trajectory. This month at the Melbourne International Comedy festival (MICF), hundreds of Australian comedians will be trying out new material, hoping the festival will be a springboard for international opportunities like it has been for Adam Hills and Josh Thomas, and more recently Zoë Coombs Marr and Hannah Gadsby. But will their work translate overseas?In his current show at MICF, for instance, in a country where standup culture allows for more leisurely sets and long-form jokes, Pickering has a story that goes for 15 minutes.But in New York, where he splits his time, “the audience doesn’t really like a joke to go longer than two minutes inside a set”.In order to appeal to these international audiences you need to understand how comedy translates across borders, across cultures, across languages. “Comedy, unlike music, it’s kind of a conversation,” says Nazeem Hussain, a standup best known for SBS’s Legally Brown and his collaboration with Aamer Rahman in Fear of a Brown Planet. If you’re relying on a call-and-response between performer and audience, he says, the audience “need to be with you the whole way.”For many of the Australian comics who spoke to Guardian Australia, American audiences are the hardest.“They just really want to know what your schtick is,” Hussein says, laughing. Similar to Pickering, he finds a demand for brevity. “They’re almost impatient, and they want to know what you are and what you’re about before they start laughing.”Raskopoulos agrees that for Australian comedians the US is “the most foreign place”. In her experience, though – performing musical comedy instead of standup – it’s foreign in a different way: “The audiences there are so strange. So enthusiastic. So enthusiastic over nothing. Our shows ran, like, 20 minutes longer than they did anywhere else in the world.”The style of comedy we see most frequently in Australia – and the form that dominates at MICF – is the one-hour standup show. The format has origins at Edinburgh, making that festival an easier fit for Australian comics, but subtle considerations still need to be taken. Change “Woolworths” to “Sainsbury’s”, and change “pants” to “trousers”. Don’t bring cocksucking cowboys anywhere near your set.But for Zoë Coombs Marr, who won the prestigious Barry award for best show at MICF in 2016 and followed it up with a nomination for best comedy in Edinburgh, it’s not just about the literal word choices, but also the translation of intent: communicating both the meaning of the joke and “that you know you know what you’re doing, and you know how they’re going to take it”. The audience, she says, needs to feel comfortable laughing at your jokes.“That’s another part of the translation: it is about trust, really,” she says. “In order to be able to laugh at what you’re saying, they need to be able to trust that you know what the fuck you’re doing.”For Coombs Marr, the first show, whether it’s in her home town or overseas, “is always really weird because you’re working out the rhythms of an audience, and which bits they find funnier”.While Coombs Marr is mostly known in comedy circles for her character Dave, her new show Bossy Bottom is Zoë performing as Zoë, investigating a comedian’s relationship with her audience. It’s the longest relationship she has ever had, she tells the audience, but with a changing cast of characters each night.Sometimes, Coombs Marr finds herself with radically different audiences. Last year, with her company Post, she performed Oedipus Schmoedipus in Chile. The work, about the great stage deaths of history, is performed by two members of Post and a chorus of volunteers in Chile, it was performed in English with Spanish subtitles and a chorus of locals speaking Spanish.This trilingual presentation (two spoken and one written language) meant Post “didn’t know where our jokes were going to land at all”. Now translating the work to Cantonese for performances in Hong Kong, Post is discovering a whole new form of comedy: puns that exist in the similarities between written characters.Some Australian comedians only find their voice abroad. When Candy Bowers first performed in Edinburgh in 2008, she found an international, multicultural performance scene far more erse than she had enjoyed back home. “There still wasn’t as many women as I dreamt about, or as international as I hoped for … But there were pockets,” she says. “We were able to feel a bit more aligned.“What I realised was all this time I’d been probably making comedy and theatre for a South African audience, for a South African canon, which was really crazy, because I’m like ‘how?!’” Although Bowers had grown up on Australian comedy, there was a kinship between her comedy and this audience: “It was for them. And that really blew me away.”Hussain says he found performing in his parents’ home country of Sri Lanka “almost like a homecoming”. There, he was treated like a celebrity, with a press conference before the show and an excited, enthusiastic audience. And while Hussain adapted his work for the new country (and the children in the audience people attended with their whole families), “they were up for anything”, he says. “It was kind of nice.”And, he jokes, “I didn’t realise the shared lack of enthusiasm for British colonialism – so those jokes also went down pretty well.”For the comics that come out of Melbourne comedy festival, part of the thrill in touring their work will be finding their way into the translation and finding where the commonalities lie. It’s a discovery that, largely, can only take place in the room. “It’s sort of like a laugh is like a Rosetta Stone,” says Coombs Marr. “You can go: ‘OK, you find that funny, so we’ll use that as a jumping-off point in order to communicate.’”“The job is about finding a way to communicate to an audience,” says Coombs Marr.“People are looking for that nugget of truth. And so for some people that might be represented by a Coles joke or a Woolworths joke, and for some people it might be represented by a Sainsbury’s joke. But, essentially, at its heart, it’s the same thing.”• Zoe Coombs Marr and Charlie Pickering are performing at Melbourne International Comedy festival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f0db7694aea59ac3d3ba01d7e57d7fa0758792/145_85_5304_3183/master/5304.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cc79cd14c1f99125044a62c42eb2a80d 1240w","title":"how we made a taste of honey rita tushingham","story":"‘I don’t know how I landed the lead role. My only acting experience had been as the back legs of a horse at the Liverpool Playhouse’Tony Richardson, the director, made it fun for everybody on set. I remember the props man was so thrilled to be working there that on the first day he went out and got drunk. My character Jo, with her innocence, toughness and cheek, was richly written by Shelagh Delaney. You can spot her in an early scene – she’s the tall lady watching the girls play basketball. My only acting experience had been as the back legs of a horse for the Liverpool Playhouse. I honestly don’t know what landed me the lead part. I think they were after an unknown, someone you wouldn’t associate with other roles. But it says much about Tony that he brought in people like me who wouldn’t usually have been considered for a movie.I was given freedom to express myself. In the classroom scene where I’m misbehaving, Tony just said: “Do what you want.” It helped that I was near Jo’s age. There’s this sort of jump-cut to my eyes when I realise the teacher has caught me. It’s one of those moments where, thanks to brilliant editing, there’s no need to say anything. I was happy with the un-made-up look. I suppose it was shocking, coming after the chocolate box 1950s, to have a female lead presented in such a raw way, but audiences identified with Jo. It was also controversial to depict a relationship between a white girl and a black guy, played by Paul Danquah, who I became great friends with. You can see it in the way we improvise that scene on the steps, where he pretends to play the bongo and I do a little dance. I’d never been in front of a camera before but didn’t feel inhibited at all. Murray Melvin had already played Geoffrey, the gentle homosexual, on the stage. He taught me so much about preparation and relaxing. His is the character your heart bleeds for, whereas Jo and her mother, unusually for the time, are presented as two females with a certain power. Whenever there is a problem, they go in with all guns blazing.I’d been working in a stuffy, studio-bound atmosphere making films by numbers for Pinewood. Tony was such a refreshing contrast: a follower of the French new wave who gave us artistic freedom. The decision to shoot the film entirely out of the studio was radical for the time, but Tony loved being different. And I was his right-hand man. Because of its realistic style, A Taste of Honey was sneeringly called a kitchen-sink drama. Yet the film has great lyricism, making beautiful use of locations in Salford found by our art director, Ralph Brinton. There’s one scene where a heavily pregnant Jo walks with Geoffrey along the canal. Tony had this idea of having a singing, wandering band of children passing them. It’s a moment of pure cinema and typically Tony. We used Arriflex handheld cameras a lot. I had form on that as I’d been in the Army film unit for three years during the second world war, shooting in near battlefield conditions. Their use is especially noticeable in the scenes on Blackpool Pier, where heavy camera tracks weren’t feasible. Shooting in black and white was a financial decision: colour was expensive. And the Eastman colour stock was slow and needed heavy lighting units, unlike black-and-white high-speed film, which was ideal for the poor lighting conditions we were often filming in.Rita was an incredible actress with very expressive eyes – just a bit of emotion would flicker over her face and convey so much. My heart turns over a little when I watch the film now: so many of the crew and cast have gone. But the film was way ahead of its time and still looks modern today. • A Taste of Honey is part of the Woodfall Films season at BFI Southbank, London, this month.

Customers who belong to the myWaitrose loyalty scheme will still be able to get free tea or coffee from the stores’ self-service machines but will be instead be asked to use a refillable cup, the company said. The removal of disposable cups will initially take place in nine stores from 30 April as a trial for managing the changeover before the scheme is rolled out nationwide in a phased programme.The grocery chain said the move would save more than 52 million cups a year across the UK. According to a recent report from the parliamentary environmental audit committee, the UK throws away 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year. They cannot be recycled by normal systems because they are made from cardboard with a tightly bonded polyethylene liner, which is difficult to remove. As a result, just one in 400 cups are recycled.“We realise this is a major change, but we believe removing all takeaway disposable cups is the right thing to do for our business and are confident the majority of customers will support the environmental benefits,” said Tor Harris, head of sustainability and responsible sourcing at Waitrose. “It underlines our commitment to plastic and packaging reduction, and our aim is to deliver this as quickly as possible.”Trewin Restorick of the environmental charity Hubbub said: “This is a bold move by Waitrose that should be applauded. It is great to see a major retailer taking decisive action to cut waste in such a high profile part of their business.” The changes mean myWaitrose members will not be able to claim their free hot drink in the chain’s 180 in-store cafes, to avoid customers without a reusable cup who cannot use the self-service machines putting increased pressure on the catering areas. Instead, myWaitrose members who purchase a tea or coffee in a cafe will get a choice of food options free or with a significant discount.

Clubs in English football’s top two tiers have, however, been forced by law to be all-seat ever since Lord Justice Taylor’s report into the tragedy at Hillsborough which left 96 Liverpool fans dead.The anger, grief and shock caused by Hillsborough meant any debate about the rights and wrongs of standing to watch football was a non-starter for years but that has changed in the last decade. This is a result of large numbers of fans making it clear they want the choice and many safety experts pointing out that standing itself is not dangerous but standing in seated areas is. It was this last point that prompted West Brom’s director of operations, Mark Miles, to make the application.“I find the decision from the minister of sport both surprising and disappointing,” Miles said. “It will be disappointing for many supporters I have spoken to who were in favour of what we were proposing.

With the Champions League second legs on the horizon, we wonder whether Manchester City have a chance against Liverpool, and have a think about Sam Allardyce’s conflicting statements to the press about how he motivates his players after a goalless Merseyside derby. We rattle through the rest of the Premier League fixtures, stopping to gawp at Ayoze Pérez’s finish against Leicester, the two red cards at the end of Arsenal vs Southampton and West Brom’s fans. While there weren’t huge shifts in the Championship table, there was the amusing spectacle of Cardiff manager Neil Warnock telling his Wolves counterpart to ‘eff off’ after Warnock judged him to be lacking in class - we round up the rest of the Football League too.

There are three that I make on rotation at home. One: a banana buttermilk loaf from my friend and soon-to-be royal-wedding-cake-maker, Claire Ptak. And then there are these two: a dense, gooey (and incidentally vegan) chocolate cakemade with coconut oil (as much of a hit with my two year old as it is my vegan brother) and a loaf cake peppered with flecks of rosemary and chunks of chocolate and which uses olive oil instead of butter. The rosemary and chocolate are an unexpectedly subtle pairing, which I adore. This is a less sweet cake, almost fudgy, dotted with chunks of chocolate with a delicate herbal back-note. It’s so good that, if I got married again, I’d have it as a layer in my wedding cake.This is such an easy cake to make: no creaming, no sifting. Be sure to use a tight-fitting cake tin as the batter is quite wet and will run out if there are any gaps.For the cake225g plain or light spelt flour1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda1 good pinch salt75g cocoa250g dark muscovado sugar75g coconut oil1½ tsp vinegar (I use cider)Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Grease an 18cm round springform cake tin with oil and line the base with baking parchment.Put all of the icing ingredients except the chopped chocolate into a heavy-based saucepan with 60ml cold water. Heat until the coconut oil is melted, making sure the mixture doesn’t boil, then turn off the heat, add the chocolate and leave it to sit. After about a minute, whisk until you have a dark glossy icing and set aside. It should be cool and thick by the time the cake has baked and cooled.For the cake, whisk the flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt and cocoa together in a bowl. Make sure there are no lumps of bicarbonate of soda.In a separate bowl, mix the sugar, 375ml of just-boiled water, the coconut oil and vinegar. When the coconut oil has melted, stir into the dry ingredients, then pour into the prepared tin.Bake for 35-40 minutes. When it is ready, the cake should come away from the edges of the tin and a skewer inserted into the centre will come out clean. Cool for 30 minutes in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Pour over the icing and decorate as you wish – I have used a few flowers here, but chopped nuts and grated chocolate are also favourites.You can use a standard olive oil here it doesn’t need to be extra virgin. It pairs wonderfully with rosemary, but I have also made this by nestling a few bay leaves in the top of the batter instead. You could also replace the rosemary with orange zest or the seeds from a vanilla pod.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Oil and line a 1kg loaf tin. Put the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a large bowl and use a whisk to mix together, making sure there are no lumps of baking powder.In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the olive oil, milk and rosemary and mix. Now fold the olive oil mixture into the dry ingredients, gently mixing until just combined, but no more: for a light cake, don’t overmix.Stir in most of the chocolate, saving a little for the top. Pour the mixture into the tin and smooth the top. Scatter the rest of the chocolate on top, pushing the pieces down into the mixture a little so they are half covered, then scatter over the demerara sugar for a crunchy top.Bake for about 40 minutes, or until it is golden brown and a skewer comes out clean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d19f32869ede86e5171d57039ac7034fd7dc09/631_101_3451_3450/master/3451.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5168a37441f846306e8e2dc13a3bc112 2600w","title":"ruby tandoh recipe for orange blossom ricotta cheesecake","story":"A sunny dessert – layered with apricots and amaretti – to make you feel warm insideWith the final throes of the arctic winter behind us, it’s time to eat our way into a sunnier mindset.

And when it comes to children’s magazines, the problem is even worse Women’s magazine editors have always understood the importance of a good cover. An illustration of Queen Victoria’s bust, surrounded by stylish women behaving as domestic role models, was credited with propelling Mrs Beeton’s The Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine to bestseller status in 1857, earning it “more patrons than any other magazine in the Empire”, one newspaper said. As a mixed-race girl growing up in Britain in the 1990s, I might have still been in the era of empire, as far as my relationship with popular magazines was concerned. Yes, I bought Just Seventeen, More, Marie Claire, Elle and Vogue, but the fact that I – and thousands of other women and girls of colour like me – spent our money on glossies did not mean they catered for us. Through ignorance and indifference, they frequently featured no one of black, Asian, mixed or any other ethnic minority heritage from cover to cover, while advice on makeup, skin care, hair styles and products was unfailingly irrelevant to us.New research by the Guardian’s data team shows how little has changed. The covers of some the UK’s most popular monthlies remain overwhelmingly white.For our study, we looked only at publications whose covers mostly featured people and based our calculations on covers that show only one person. The picture is similar if “multi-person” covers are included. The representation problem is not confined to women’s magazines. While GQ featured two black cover models over the year, the other men’s magazine in our study, Men’s Health, had just one. Neither publication featured men from any other minority background.The inclusion of children’s and men’s titles in the Guardian’s research shines a greater light on the state of ersity in magazines, a debate that usually centres on a smaller number of women’s glossy magazines and especially British Vogue. During its former editor Alexandra Shulman’s 25 years at the helm, only two black women were given solo covers. Shulman said in 2012 that, “in a society where the mass of the consumers are white and where, on the whole, mainstream ideas sell, it’s unlikely there will be a huge rise in the number of leading black models”.When Shulman stepped down in 2017, making way for UK Vogue’s first black editor, Edward Enninful, her leaving photo depicted an all-white editorial staff at the magazine.Enninful rebooted interest in the magazine, with a much-celebrated first cover featuring British Ghanaian model Adwoa Aboah – a confident decision that may have stemmed from Enninful’s time at Italian Vogue, where the first ever “black issue” sold so well that an extra 60,000 copies had to be printed. The magazine’s most recent cover headlined “New Frontiers”, was also praised for featuring a erse range of models including Halima Aden, the first woman to wear a hijab on the magazine’s cover.Vanity Fair in the US, meanwhile, has repeatedly come in for criticism for its Hollywood covers – Annie Leibowitz photo shoots depicting an array of A-list actors in a spread that is intended to depict the state of the movie industry. “Young Hollywood is thin, white,” ran one critical headline in response to the magazine’s 2010 cover, which did not feature a single person of colour. Recent years have seen a push for ersity, with the 2017 cover featuring mixed-heritage Irish actor Ruth Negga, Lupita Nyong’o and Janelle Monáe. The magazine’s new editor, Radhika Jones, signalled a further change of intent by putting Lena Waithe, the black (and gay) actor and writer, on the April edition.But the Guardian’s data suggests focus on changes at Vogue and Vanity Fair has obscured failings elsewhere. “The industry is still overwhelmingly homogenous,” says a senior figure from an ethnic minority background working at another UK magazine, who did not want to be named. “Obviously, the appointment of Edward at Vogue is amazing, but that doesn’t change the fact that magazines are still incredibly white and middle class.”One obvious indicator of the historic failure of the biggest glossy titles to cater for black and Asian women has been the mushrooming of magazines aimed directly at them. From long-established magazines such as Pride and Black Beauty and Hair to new black platforms such as Black Ballad, Gal-Dem, Glam Africa, and Skin Deep, and Asian titles such as Asian Woman, DesiMag and Burnt Roti, women of colour have been reaching for magazines that normalise their look and the issues facing their communities.“Growing up, I would pick up magazines, and I never saw anybody who looked like me,” says Afua Adom, former editor of Pride. “I was really into music, so I used to read Smash Hits and magazines like that I never saw a person who looked like me. And where I lived in Scotland there was no one who looked like me anywhere. My mum subscribed to Pride, and that’s why I wanted to work there all those years ago – because it was the only magazine I saw full of women who looked like me.”The mainstream magazines are little better than they used to be. “You flick through any title and there’s a page that’s got shampoos and stuff and there’s nothing for afro hair, or there are no beauty solutions for darker skins, or there’s no skincare for darker skin,” Adom says. “It’s like that all the time. And you just think: ‘The way that you’ve alienated so many women who pick up this magazine so quickly, there’s no thought process there at all.’”One of the magazines I read while growing up was Marie Claire, which remains one of the UK’s bestselling women’s monthlies. Although its content is more erse than it was, its covers did not feature a single non-white model in 2017.I tell Trish Halpin, Marie Claire’s editor in chief, of my surprise that the magazine is still failing to speak to women like me on its covers.Halpin agrees that the magazine’s record is problematic, but she says editors lack control over the timing of their cover stars. “We changed from model covers about 15, 20 years ago,” she says. “It’s now very much about that A-list star on the cover that’s going to sell the magazine on the newsstand. We start with a wishlist of essentially very recognisable stars, within a particular demographic of the age of women we are speaking to – early 20s, to late 30s, early 40s. Within that wishlist, there are definitely a good number of black women and women of colour. But it’s not that easy to get them. We are experiencing the trickle effect – there still isn’t a big enough pool. We had two black actresses lined up for 2017, but their publicist decided to go with other titles. We are hoping we are going to secure one of those for our summer covers next year.”I approached three other editors, who didn’t wish to go on the record. But other senior figures in the industry say the Guardian’s research reflects a relatively small pool of BAME A-list stars, linked to a wider inability in the film and fashion industries to recognise BAME talent. Yet over the decades magazine editors have proved their ability to shape perceptions as much as to reflect them. They are the ones who decide who is “cover-worthy”.All of the magazine industry figures I spoke to, while admitting shortcomings in cover ersity, pointed to significant change inside magazines. Halpin said that, in relation to Marie Claire, it was important to judge the magazine by its content as well.“You’ll see a very different story there,” she says. “At Marie Claire, we used 17 models of colour – which is probably about a third to a quarter of all of the models that we shoot.”The change inside magazines is one I have noticed, and one that would have gone a long way towards alleviating my own anxiety of otherness, had it been the case when I was a young magazine reader. Greater use of models of colour on inside pages reflects the progress being made across the fashion industry. The website Fashion Spot reported a rise in ersity in global fashion in 2017, with the big fashion capitals of New York, Milan, Paris and London all featuring more women of colour than in previous years.But covers matter. Those who appear on them are the ambassadors of beauty, success and commercial appeal. For those who scan magazine racks, the impression of whose faces are projected out on to a shop floor has a visceral impact – and the choices of whose faces those are reverberate, influencing others. There’s a danger, too, that ersifying the models inside magazines while the covers remain white sends a new message of hierarchical beauty standards – suggesting women of colour have their place, and it’s not on the cover.Internationally, according to the Fashion Spot, cover stars are becoming more racially erse. Six of the 10 most booked cover stars in 2017 were women of colour, such as Dutch-Egyptian-Moroccan model Imaan Hammam. Adwoa Aboah graced eight international covers Rihanna featured on seven.This makes the tendency of some editors – who have historically passed the buck elsewhere within the fashion industry – seem harder to sustain. “Black models don’t sell magazines,” Jourdan Dunn, one of the most recognisable fashion faces in the UK, was told when she inquired about the absence of other black women from a high-end fashion magazine in 2013. Yet their current popularity on the catwalk suggests that they could.The magazine industry’s reluctance to put BAME women on its covers is not the only way it is failing the public. The situation is even worse regarding larger, older and transgender models. But there are numerous firsthand accounts of the way in which representation of race has a particularly negative effect on black women.Nyong’o, for example, has spoken candidly about the impact black supermodel Alek Wek had on her shortly before she won her first Oscar. “She was dark as night, she was on all of the runways and in every magazine, and everyone was talking about how beautiful she was,” Nyong’o has said. “My complexion had always been an obstacle to overcome … When I saw Alek … I had a spring in my step because I felt more seen, more appreciated by the far away gatekeepers of beauty.” Nyong’o – and the other members of the tiny group of women of colour who do feature on magazine covers – are still overcoming these obstacles. In 2017, two magazines – the Evening Standard magazine and Grazia – infuriated black women in particular when they airbrushed out the more visible elements of black hairstyles from cover models’ looks. “I remember the Lupita Nyong’o cover where Grazia just airbrushed her afro out,” says Adom. “I was so disappointed, because I really love that title – I buy it all the time. And they took such a long a long time to apologise … I just thought: ‘You guys just don’t get it.’”As the country becomes increasingly erse – more than a quarter of schoolchildren in England are from ethnic minority groups – it is of special concern that this is not being reflected in magazine covers. Corinna Shaffer, editorial director of Immediate Media, which publishes 21 children’s magazine titles, including all but one of those featured in the Guardian study, acknowledges more needs to be done.It’s interesting that Shaffer mentions tokenism. Across the industry, there’s a concern that crude attempts to remedy a lack of ersity in magazine covers will do more harm than good.“I have sat in meetings at some publications where someone has said, ‘Oh, we haven’t got a black person in the May edition – we need to figure that out,’” says one source at a women’s magazine. “When I hear that, it tells me you are not getting it right – that is just tokenistic. We need to talk about the underlying reasons why black women are not finding themselves on the covers, as they undeniably should, through the normal process.”“You don’t have to have a erse team to have erse magazine covers, but when you do, ersity is a natural outflow of that. You have people who have different points of view and opinion – a more well-rounded mix,” the source adds. “We are not even getting people from a erse range of backgrounds applying for positions at a senior level.”The failure of magazines to recruit from a wide pool of journalists – particularly in erse cities such as London – creates a vicious cycle in which unreflective newsrooms continue to produce unreflective editorial and cover content, further alienating readers from different backgrounds.“The erasure of black and brown people from magazine covers is part of a much broader process of “othering” – it reinforces the idea that people of colour are not the norm,” says writer and critic Maya Goodfellow. “What should concern us all is the multifaceted impact this has on notions of race in the UK and the idea it creates that people of colour don’t belong.”It is also bad business. In these challenging economic times, neither publishers nor the advertisers on whom they rely can afford to turn away ethnic minority women who, figures show, spend a disproportionate amount on beauty and cosmetic products.If my teenage experience is anything to go by, the images magazines choose to place on their covers are incredibly influential, not just reflecting trends and celebrity in other industries, but setting them. When it comes to representation of people of colour, it is a responsibility, and an opportunity, that they could do much more to harness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dab00cc7019a6967cfeed7360660440b36dae6b/0_133_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=95d1ceb7b84226cf857b3d4111ed8b46 1240w","title":"lindsey buckingham fleetwood mac tour","story":"The longstanding member will be replaced by the Tom Petty guitarist Mike Campbell and Crowded House’s Neil FinnLindsey Buckingham has parted ways with Fleetwood Mac months before they are scheduled to embark on a live tour.In a statement, the band announced: “Lindsey Buckingham will not be performing with the band on this tour.

Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.“I hope if there’s willingness … we will close a deal which will be as close to what we know now as possible. But we have to be realistic and we have to realise that there will be changes. Leaving the single market comes with a price tag and unfortunately the price tag is also a Danish price tag. “That is the reality of life. There will be more bureaucracy in future, unfortunately.”The European council president, Donald Tusk, has already told the UK that it should not expect frictionless trade outside the single market. “Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit,” he said in March. Rasmussen, whose country is generally regarded as sympathetic toward the UK having also joined the EU in 1973, insisted Brussels was simply aiming to be “realistic and fair” in the negotiations. May also signalled that the government’s goal of cutting net annual immigration to below 100,000 would remain in place after Brexit. She said: “We recognise the concern that people in the UK have about this issue of net migration into the UK, which is why we set ourselves the target … and want to continue to work to ensure that we address that particular target.”Her position was in stark contrast to that of her home secretary, Amber Rudd, who repeatedly refused to confirm to the Commons home affairs committee last month that she was aiming to meet the target by the next election. The two leaders also discussed fishing rights, and May promised that Denmark, whose boats regularly fish in British waters, would get “fair and reciprocal access” after Brexit.Britain is braced for tough negotiations with Brussels after delaying the decision over who will control and have access to its territorial waters.

Any comments, hopes, dreams? Do send them through on email michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18.Right, that’s me done for the afternoon. I’ll hand you over now to my colleague Michael Butler who’ll take you through the evening session.Still a heap of action to look for tonight. Here’s a quick reminder:Thanks for hanging out. Enjoy your evening.Nigeria’s Esther Oyema has won gold and broken a world record in the para powerlifting women’s lightweight final. Oyema score of 141.6 was enough to beat out fellow Nigerian Lucy Ejike and England’s Zoe Newson who won silver and bronze respectively.Sad news this. The elbow injury that forced New Zealand transgender competitor Laurel Hubbard out of the weightlifting competition has ended her career, Reuters reports. The Australian women are doing in pretty easy in the beach volleyball against Rwanda. They’ve just won the first set 21-9. While the sides take a break the crowd are being led through a rendition of Sweet Caroline. Because I guess why not?Amid all the excitement of the cycling I almost missed a gold medal! India’s Heena Sidhu has taken out the women’s 25m pistol ahead of Australia’s Elena Galiabovitch. Quite a shot of England’s Hayley Simmonds after her bronze in the women’s inidual time trial. Simmonds came to the Games as England’s national champion, but this is her first time on the podium at the international level.In a moment I’ll take you to the women’s beach volleyball, where Australia’s women are about to take on Rwanda in the quarterfinals. First though, file this one under administrative disaster. English cyclist Melissa Lowthe was denied the chance to compete in the women’s time trial thanks to a Team England official’s failure to tick a box in her entry form.The oversight wasn’t spotted, despite “seven or eight” layers of checks. My colleague Martha Kelner reports from the Gold Coast.Still on cycling, my colleague Kate O’Halloran has this on today’s other gold winning cyclist from Australia, Cameron Meyer. Have a look. That’s it, Katrin Garfoot wins gold for Australia in the women’s road cycling time trial in emphatic fashion. When the rain started to fall before she started her race it could have thrown her but she was faster the whole way and never looked like losing. Heck, coming into the backend of the race and Garfoot’s really showing while she’s the favourite. With 5km to run she’s more than 40 seconds ahead of New Zealand’s Linda Villumsen in second. It really feels like the Australian has benefitted from having time riding this course in the lead-up. She’s hitting those tight corners so quick it’s frightening. We’re underway in the cycling with the women’s road time trial. The race is a 25.5km slog through the hills of Currumbin, a suburb of the Gold Coast. Currumbin’s actually best known for its birds. A couple of years ago an eagle attacked a woman’s at a wildlife sanctuary there! Let’s hope the cyclists aren’t distracted by the thought of crazed eagles attacking their faces, though, because it’s raining out there right now and they’ll need their wits about them. There’s a few steep climbs and tight corners in this course.Australia’s Katrin Garfoot is the red-hot favourite. The German-born Garfoot actually lives on the Gold Coast, so she’s had a chance to practice on this course. New Zealand’s Linda Villumsen won this event four years ago and will also be one to watch, as is Scotland’s Katie Archibald England’s Hayley Simmonds. As I write this we’re about 10km in and Simmonds is ahead of Archibald the Scot. South Africa’s Akani Simbine and Michelle-Lee Ahye of Trinidad and Tobago have been speaking to reporters the day after their impressive wins in the men’s and women’s 100m sprint final last night. Simbine was a shock winner over Yohan Blake, who’d been favourite to carry on Jamaica’s dominance in the event following Usain Bolt’s retirement. Instead Simbine became the first South African to win the 100m gold, finishing in 10.03 seconds ahead of compatriot Henricho Bruintjies who won silver and Blake in third. The 24-year-old has previously finished fifth at the 2016 Rio Olympics and last year’s world championships in London.“The guys back home have been going crazy - my phone, social media, my parents still can’t believe it, they’re so excited. My mum is smiling - like ‘next level’ smiling.“It’s an amazing feeling, it’s still sinking in, I haven’t slept much.“I thought it would’ve been a tighter race. I actually had a bit of a gap (Blake). I told myself I had to get out in front of Yohan. I knew if I could get to the 60m before him, I knew I would win.“Africa was a sprinting nation, there was Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia that used to run fast. But now we have South Africans and Nigerians running fast.“There were four Africans in the final last night, which shows Africa is doing something right.Ahye won in 11.14 ahead of Jamaican duo Christania Williams and Gayon Evans.“It feels amazing. This is my first gold medal in an inidual event, so it means a lot. It’s still sinking in, I’m still shocked.“Everybody’s going crazy my phone is still blurting out from last night. My mom is still screaming.”While we’re waiting for the women’s cycling to begin, let’s hear from Australia’s world champion track cyclist Cameron Meyer, who, as I mentioned earlier, won gold in the men’s inidual time trial this morning.The 30-year-old is a former Tour Down Under winner who’s also recorded stage wins in the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia. He finished the race in 48 minutes and 13.04 seconds. Meyer narrowly missed out on a podium finish in the 40km points race a few nights ago, and said after the race that he he was determined to make up for that disappointment.“There’s so much motivation going around after the first week with other athletes winning gold. I missed my target in the (track cycling men’s 40km) points race, so I did have fire in my belly going out there today, and it couldn’t have gone better.”He also revealed that he’d only decided to ride in the time trial a fortnight ago. “Only two weeks ago. My coach approached me because he knew I had good road-racing form. He sorted out a bike out for me and got all my measurements and I just thought I’d give it a crack.”“Recently I’ve been concentrating on my track cycling for Tokyo (2020 Olympic Games). I broke my collarbone in the last road race I did (two-and-a-half years ago), and that put me off, but I’m really happy I gave it a second shot.”Greetings, sports lovers of the Commonwealth. Welcome to another day of action from the sunny Gold Coast.If you’re catching up, Australia has streaked away in the medal count in the first five days, picking up a swag of gold in the pool. Last night’s big one was the women’s 100m freestyle final, where the Campbell sisters – Bronte and Cate – nabbed gold and silver for the hosts.England had success in the squash finals where James Willstrop picked up the gold, while the Jamaican Yohan Blake failed to produce in the men’s 100m sprint final, losing out to the South African duo of Akani Simbine and Henricho Bruintjies.The big news so far today is that Cameron Meyer has won gold for Australia in the cycling, winning the men’s inidual time trial. Earlier today in shooting England and Wales both picked up gold in the shooting Queen’s Prize Pair and men’s 50m rifle prone finals. Here’s what’s still to come on day five. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.The women’s cycling time trial is the first one to watch this afternoon, it’s due to start at 2.45pm. England and Australia’s men’s hockey teams both have big games today too, taking on Wales and Canada respectively. Later we’ve got the final day of action in the pool with a whopping nine more gold to be won, and in athletics the men’s 110m hurdles, the women’s 1500m and the men’s Decathlon 1500m are among the big ticket items.

Edwards said his office had not received any reports of social media being manipulated to influence the 2017 New Zealand general election, but said Facebook seemed to have “lost control” of its platform, and showed no sense of responsibility regarding the 2.5 million New Zealand accounts it administered, or respect for New Zealand’s privacy laws.In an interview with the Guardian last month New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she continued to operate a Facebook account, and had no additional security or protections than any other New Zealander.Ardern used Facebook messenger to inform her partner Clarke Gayford that she had been elected leader of the Labour party in August last year, and that she was pregnant. “Obviously social media in a political environment can be used for both further democratisation, but it can be used in the other direction as well,” Ardern said.“We haven’t set up any direct plans to do any investigations beyond what we are seeing in the international frame, certainly we will be keeping a close eye on that.” Edwards has no plans to independently investigate privacy breaches by Cambridge Analytica in New Zealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f85d19a28033ce52a778ce392ddc8541ab7d0db/0_222_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2145f5543a487ec126fa886a173ed129 1240w","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook testimony senate house questioning","story":"Mark Zuckerberg would like you to know one thing – Facebook messed up. During a rare press conference last week, Zuckerberg was grilled by journalists over Facebook’s privacy lapses. His message was consistent: mistakes were made, he takes responsibility and the company has made sweeping changes to better protect user data.“We didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake,” he said. While some of the questions were tough, it was merely a dress rehearsal for a much more consequential grilling in Washington DC this week. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg will testify before a joint hearing of the Senate commerce and judiciary committees over data misuse, following revelations that Cambridge Analytica acquired millions of profiles of US citizens and used it to build a software program to predict and influence voters. The next day, Zuckerberg will testify on the same topic before the House energy and commerce committee.Taking the stand will be a major test for Zuckerberg’s communication skills. Unlike when he deals with the media, his public relations team won’t be there to cherry-pick questions from friendly parties. And Congress wants its pound of flesh.Adam Hodge, a crisis communications veteran from SKDKnickerbocker, agrees. “I expect members of Congress are going to grill him intensely and if they feel like they aren’t getting straight answers they are going to lose their patience pretty quickly,” he said. Zuckerberg will want to come across as authentic and apologetic, and will, according to his testimony published on Monday, highlight the sweeping changes that the company has announced already to its privacy tools and to the way third parties can access data on the platform as well as a verification process for political advertisers and page administrators. He will probably also want to talk about Facebook’s global compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a broad set of privacy protections being introduced in the European Union in May.“He clearly has to deeply, personally apologise and hope he will satisfy and blunt any attempt at US regulation,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. “He does not want to see strong regulatory oversight.”Although Zuckerberg will likely continue to blame “bad actors” misusing the platform, it will be difficult to deflect questions about Facebook’s core business model of continually tracking and monetising iniduals and their relationships.“This is a long-standing problem, not a bug in the Facebook system. It’s a feature,” said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data \u0026amp Society, pointing out that Facebook lured third-party developers by offering them access to user data.“The main issue is not whether or not entities have inidual data but how that data is being used. How are advertisers or political campaigns using that data to come back onto the Facebook system and seed content to particular users,” she added. “We know very little about how this targeting works.”Chester agrees: “People have no idea what is operating behind the Facebook curtain. They don’t know about data mining, analytics and digital ad practices,” he said.The company is pouring money into its defence, hiring US law firm WilmerHale, led by Reginald Brown, previously a special adviser to President George W Bush, to coach Zuckerberg on the best strategies for handling the heat, according to the New York Times. At the same time Facebook is bolstering its lobbying capabilities. The company spent almost $12m on lobbying in 2017 and is currently on a “hiring spree” for policy communications specialists. In spite of this investment, Zuckerberg can’t expect an easy ride – as the bosses of other companies in industries facing public and political ire have found.One tactic policymakers might use is to fixate on tiny symbolic details that might tarnish Facebook rather than questions that go to the core of the problem. This happened in 2008 when the CEOs of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors took private jets to Washington to request taxpayer bailout money.“They came to discuss the fate of a major industry and Congress hit them on ‘why did you fly here?’” said Ratner. “He’s going to have to be prepared for that.”A few rounds of public humiliation might just be the price Zuckerberg has to pay to appease regulators, provided he is generous with his time and detailed and contrite in his responses. The only real imminent regulatory threat to his company is the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation, which could lead to huge fines.“Symbolically he’s going to be taken to the political woodshed, but will probably be let off without any serious consequences at a federal level,” said Chester."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac5885fad805ad4f66ed6bbe298558acb3b0a60/0_23_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4ce2dc9f3075119b4a2139f01e3963a0 1240w","title":"tuesdays best tv gotham this time next year class of mum and dad","story":"Season four of the Batman prequel opens with pure panto on E4, while Davina McCall presents more tear-jerking life-changers.

There’s still profiling when it comes to Polynesians. It’s not even a colour thing – like, ‘Oh, there’s a black person.’ It’s, ‘If you’re Poly then you’re getting profiled.’”On Tuesday, Ardern was asked if she agreed with Waititi’s assertion that New Zealand was a racist society, and that Polynesian and Maori people continue to be negatively stereotyped. Waititi was named New Zealander of the Year in 2017 and has also featured in campaign videos for the Human Rights Commission calling for an end to racism.“I don’t know where F sits on the quantum,” said Ardern when asked how serious Waititi’s comments were by The AM Show. “I think probably you’d be hard-pressed to find a country that didn’t have racism in it, New Zealand is one of them.”“Is there racism in New Zealand? Undeniably. Is there racism in most countries? Undeniably. Can we do better? Yes.”Race relations commissioner Dame Susan Devoy applauded Waititi’s direct approach, and said the director painted an accurate portrait of the state of racial affairs in his country.“When someone like Taika Waititi comes out and speaks the truth and talks from experience, we as New Zealanders need to sit up and listen,” Devoy told TVNZ’s Breakfast show.“Good on Taika for having the courage to speak up ... we need to actually understand that racism is an issue in New Zealand – and what are we going to do about it?“I’ve seen criticism of him speaking out against things that aren’t favourable in New Zealand – I think he’s walking the talk – he’s showing humanity in action and highlighting an issue that he’s personally experienced and asking New Zealand to do better.Reaction to Waititi’s interview was mixed in New Zealand, with some people applauding the director’s frank comments, while others said he was actively “sabotaging” the country’s international reputation and overstating how bad the issue was.“Come home and reintroduce yourself to your country. It’s a great little country that’s not without its challenges but we’re not as racist as ‘F’.“Many countries use us as the model for how to deal with indigenous issues, actually.

The country’s former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has been grinning from thousands of posters and billboards recently, palms pressed together in gratitude.Voters delivered a shock repudiation of Rajapaksa’s government three years ago, as the UN investigated war crimes against Tamil civilians, dissidents disappeared in unmarked white vans and warnings were issued that Sri Lankan democracy was at risk.In February, however, they gave the Buddhist nationalist leader’s new party a surprise victory in local government elections.With polls for parliament and the presidency scheduled for two years’ time, the result has reaffirmed Rajapaksa as Sri Lanka’s most popular politician, and raised hopes among his supporters – and fears in others – that he may yet return to power.The Rajapaksa-led opposition forced a no-confidence motion in parliament against the prime minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe, last week. It failed, but Wickremasinghe was criticised by several of his own ministers during the debate, widening cracks in the already fragile coalition government that turfed Rajapsaksa from office in 2015.“We are heading towards a snap election,” said Namal Rajapaksa, an MP and the former president’s son and heir apparent. “The future of the coalition government is going to be very unstable. The president and the prime minister have no other option.”Campaign ads in the run-up to the February polls were stark. “Remember when winning a rugby match was punishable by death?” asked one United National party flyer, in reference to a murder allegedly linked to the Rajapaksa family. “Remember when white vans were a symbol of terror and repression?”The resurgence of a leader with such heavy baggage is less surprising to close observers of Sri Lankan politics. “Rajapaksa never went away,” said Alan Keenan, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. “His shadow has loomed over this government, literally from the first day.”It took an unlikely coalition to unseat Rajapaksa from the presidency in 2015. Appalled by a leader they regarded as breathtakingly corrupt and increasingly authoritarian, defectors from his own party forged an alliance with members of the opposition, campaigning on a unity platform of reviving civil society and tackling corruption.In power, however, longtime political enemies have struggled to work together, finding they are united by little more than antipathy toward the former president. “The relationship between the president and prime minister is as bad as it could be,” Keenan said.To win over minorities such as the Tamils, the current president, Maithripala Sirisena, promised to implement tough reforms, including to devolve power to regional governments, pursue the cases of those who disappeared during the Rajapaksa years, and reform the constitution to ensure no president could accrue the power of his predecessor.Commentators in Colombo agree too much of that agenda has been shirked by a government afraid of challenging Buddhist nationalist sentiment in the country, and kicking off a wave of rightwing anger that could lift Rajapaksa and his family back into office.Less lofty issues have also sapped the government’s support. The price of staples such as onions, fish and coconuts has increased steeply, while a decision to remove an uneconomical fertiliser subsidy has burned the agricultural sector, which still employs nearly one in three Sri Lankans.“Mahinda looked after us,” said Gamaga Nona, a paddy and banana farmer in Madilla, a village on Sri Lanka’s south coast. Fertiliser was eight times cheaper under the Rajapaksa government, she said, and the change has nearly halved the annual profit of her family farm. “Now the fertiliser is delayed and sometimes we never get it.”Civil society groups in Colombo acknowledge a pall has lifted since 2015. Newspapers that once laboured under official censorship, or the kind enforced by military vehicles parked outside journalists’ homes at night, now print boisterous criticism of the government. Human rights groups chased out ten years ago are re-establishing offices in the city. People are breathing more easily, said Asoka Obeyesekere, a barrister and director of the local chapter of Transparency International. “Civil society are not fearing for their lives anymore.”Namal Rajapaksa calls the allegations of corruption and violence that dogged his father “well planned, well executed propaganda”. “We are looking for a fresh start,” he said. “We will correct our mistakes and look for a broader relationship with our neighbours.”His party would seek a clean slate with western governments, he said, but added that continuing to participate in a UN security council investigation into the final months of the civil war – in which about 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed – would need to be “looked into more deeply”.“Any war will have casualties, we won’t deny that,” Rajapaksa said. “But at the end of the day what matters is the future.”Should opposition groups find a way to paper over their differences, and unite as they did in 2015, they may still have the numbers to keep the Rajapaksas out.“The local government results showed no other political force in the country can shine on their own,” Obeyesekere said. “Really the only way to have any strength is in unity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49cddabee9fe6ff99ea52e541c7e1d79828b5744/0_249_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f0895941cb781a1a454e9a22dbd6dd1d 1240w","title":"the afghan cop who became a german nurse and other refugee success stories","story":"German initiatives are equipping new arrivals with the skills to alleviate the country’s worker shortageIt’s breakfast time at a care home in Brandenburg and Zia Hayafi is busy. He is gently moving an elderly woman from her bed into a wheelchair. He should be hurrying – they are waiting for her in the dining room. But he takes his time, moving close to her ear to ask: “Did you sleep well?” She nods.“I like old people,” he says. “When I’m that old, I’m going to want someone nice around to look after me.”Hayafi, 20, has been working here for three months. It is about as different as can be imagined from his former life as an officer in the Afghan police force. There, the big concern was the Taliban (Hayafi, an ethnic Hazara, eventually fled). Here, the concern is whether Germany will let him stay. It should give it serious thought. Germany faces skills gaps across its economy that will only widen as the population ages. But it has also welcomed more than 1 million refugees in little more than two years. Programmes have sprung up trying to solve the former with the latter, aided by laws that look more kindly on asylum seekers working, something that is in effect forbidden in France and the UK.More than 1.2\u0026nbspmillion people sought asylum in Europe in 2016. How are they adapting to their new lives? What do they miss? What’s it like to swap Homs for Hamburg, Kabul for Croydon, or Mosul for the Mosel?​.​\u0026nbspWhich European countries are best at helping refugees settle? In this series, the Guardian teams up with Der Spiegel, Le Monde and El País to get inside newly arrived communities in western Europe to assess whether promises are being kept, whether European society is changing the new arrivals – and vice versa. But although 400,000 German companies have employed asylum seekers in one form or another, the majority have been taken on under short-term arrangements such as internships and placements, which do not always have a happy ending. According to statistics, every third trainee in Germany would have to opt for geriatric care at present to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. In fact, fewer than one in 10 do so. People like Hayafi should be a godsend. But it is not clear that he will even complete the training. His original asylum request was refused, as is increasingly common with Afghans in Europe. He could be deported at any time, but he is appealing against the decision. “I want to earn good money and buy a house,” he says. About 150 miles (240km) west, Hannah Hillebrand is having a tough time with her trainees in the kitchen. Zabi has forgotten to put sugar in the dough, Hassan is peeling hot potatoes with his bare hands and Saeed is trying to fillet a fish with the wrong knife. Hillebrand is a leader of the Refugee Canteen project in Hamburg, which gives newcomers 14 weeks of hands-on experience in its kitchen before securing them a six-week internship in a restaurant or cafe. She spent three months writing a training manual containing recipes and key facts about German cooking, but her six pupils cannot do much with it. The text is too long and the terminology is alien. She must start with the basics.But there are significant hurdles, as Hillebrand is experiencing. Aref is good at preparing potato salad, but when he is asked to get limes out of the fridge, he doesn’t move. He does not know what limes are, but he dare not admit it. “They look like green lemons,” says Hillebrand. “I’m nervous because I’m worried that I won’t understand everything,” says Saeed, who is soon to undertake his six-week placement in a restaurant. Like many others here, he had never set foot in a kitchen before he came to Germany. In Afghanistan, it was his mother who cooked. Membership Event: The New Arrivals: Is our asylum system broken?  A proper apprenticeship is a holy grail for many young asylum seekers who want to stay longer in Germany. Under the “three plus two” arrangement introduced in August 2016, they are accorded two years of leave to remain after completing three years of training. On the edge of Berlin, Basel Alsayed hands out worksheets to pupils at Am Pappelhain primary school. The sheets ask children to identify gender articles: der, die or das Blume? He doesn’t tell the pupils, but this is homework he himself was doing only weeks earlier. He hopes he won’t end up teaching the children things that are incorrect. Alsayed is enrolled in the government-funded Refugee Teachers programme of Potsdam University, in which Syrian teachers spend 18 months doing a mixture of language courses, teacher training and work experience. This year there were more applicants than the 29 places available, and the funding is currently earmarked only until March 2019. Alsayed is already proving his worth in the primary school, where one-third of pupils are originally from places such as Bosnia, Ghana, Palestine and Syria. “Basel is a firefighter – he helps wherever the need is,” says Gerald Schneider, the headteacher of Am Pappelhain. “He translates when there are language problems with parents, fills in when teachers are ill. He is scarily tough. We use him for far more than we probably should.” “I was thrown in at the deep end,” says Alsayed. He left behind Damascus, the school where he taught, his mother and other family to avoid being conscripted into the war in Syria. He headed initially for west Germany, but was resettled under a quota scheme in Zehdenick, north of Berlin.  It didn’t feel like it at the time, but this was his big break: the Potsdam scheme is not available in any other German region. Initially he was frustrated at having to study again: “Suddenly I was having to do my own homework instead of handing it out,” he says. His German is almost perfect, but now and then he mangles a declension or searches for a rare word, and when he says “p”, it sounds like “b”. Botsdam, he says.  The need for teachers like Alsayed is expected to grow. Projections indicate that in five years there will be almost 300,000 immigrant children in Germany’s schools. And the Bertelsmann Foundation forecasts a shortfall of about 35,000 primary school teachers by 2025.The potential for a solution is there: in 2016, 11,000 of the people who claimed asylum were teachers. And of course, many of them will be better able to empathise with the thousands of bewildered Syrian children in Germany’s school system. “I can’t explain to children who have come to Germany as refugees why it is that they are suddenly here,” Alsayed says. “But I think I know how they feel.”Join us for a Guardian Live event, where our panel of experts will discuss the question: is our asylum system broken?

Here’s a rundown of today’s news.Donald Trump has indicated a decision is imminent on a US response to Saturday’s chemical attack in Syria, as Russia warned that any military reprisal could have “grave repercussions”. During angry exchanges at the UN security council last night, Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s UN ambassador, said “Russia is being unpardonably threatened” and claimed Russian investigators had found no evidence of a chemical attack in Douma that killed more than 40 people and affected hundreds.US counterpart Nikki Haley in turn criticised Moscow for its unstinting backing of Bashar al-Assad and said the Russian regime’s hands were “covered in the blood of Syrian children”. Hours earlier, Trump said his administration would make “some major decisions” on the issue. He told a cabinet meeting: “This is about humanity … and it can’t be allowed to happen.” It will be the first major test of Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, who returns after a decade in the political wilderness. One of a handful of hawks who led the Bush administration’s charge into Afghanistan and Iraq, Bolton is expected to echo Trump’s instincts when it comes to military force.During her visit to Denmark, Theresa May condemned the “barbaric” targeting of innocent civilians, including children, and said Assad and his Russian backers must be held to account if found responsible for the incident.Hillary Clinton speaks – The former US secretary of state has warned that the hand of history will be “heavy and unforgiving” if the Brexit deal is allowed to undermine peace in Northern Ireland. Writing in the Guardian on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement, she said: “Reinstating the border would be an enormous setback, returning to the ‘bad old days’ when communities would once again be set apart.” She adds: “These are difficult times for Northern Ireland, and for our world. As the Brexit debate wages on, I continue to believe in the value of the European Union, and of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace.” Bill Clinton, speaking in Dublin on Monday evening, said the architects of the Good Friday agreement had created “a fine piece of work” from which others in ethnic wars could learn.Facebook fakery – A Black Lives Matter Facebook page that has almost 700,000 followers has been exposed as a fake, run by a white Australian union official. The page – which has double the number of followers as the official BLM page – might have taken more than $100,000 in donations, CNN reported. It’s the kind of news Mark Zuckerberg might have expected, a day before he is due to tell US Congress that his social media giant is a “positive force in the world”. The founder is facing huge criticism for Facebook’s lax approach to its users’ data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and he is expected to admit he has made “a big mistake”. In New Zealand, Facebook said a quiz downloaded by just 10 people meant more than 60,000 users could have had their data mined. PS feel free to tell us how the data breach has affected you.Trump decries ‘witch hunt’ – Donald Trump has declared an FBI raid on the offices of his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, “an attack on our country”. “It’s a disgraceful situation, it’s a total witch hunt, I’ve been saying it for a long time,” Trump said after the raid, which Cohen’s lawyer said stemmed from a referral by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Documents seized included some reportedly relating to a $130,000 payment Cohen has admitted making to adult film actor Stormy Daniels.Much Apu, cry Simpsons creators – The owner of a fictional Kwik-E-Mart has found himself at the centre of a debate about racial stereotyping after a screen career ning nearly 30 years. The row was sparked by the latest episode of The Simpsons, in which viewers who considered Apu Nahasapeemapetilon “politically incorrect” were urged to avoid having a cow. The attempt was panned as “completely toothless” and “a callous and resentful shrug”, and some pointed out the irony of Lisa, one of the show’s more progressive characters, being chosen to deal with the issue.Taking a shot – Waitrose aims to remove all disposable coffee cups from its shops this year, a move it says could save 52m of the items from landfill.

Nevertheless, Liverpool are in the box seat at the Etihad, with only seven teams in 126 having overturned a 3-0 deficit. Yorkshire have bemoaned “an impossible situation” and demanded the introduction of a cut-off point for Indian Premier League deals after losing David Willey to the tournament just days before the start of the county season.American tennis player Madison Brengle has filed a lawsuit against the WTA and the ITF seeking damages stemming from their “abusive administration of the anti-doping program” regarding injuries she claims were caused by needle injections from drug tests. And magistrates in the northern French town of Cambrai are to open a formal inquiry into the death of young Belgian cyclist Michael Goolaerts, who died on Sunday night after suffering a heart attack during the Paris-Roubaix race. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, has warned against “arrogant” attitudes in international relations but then appeared to dial back the rhetoric on trade issues by saying he would cut import tariffs and strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights. The tone helped Asian shares rise overnight and also teed up the FTSE100 for a healthy bounce this morning.The pound is buying $1.413 and €1.147.Fallout from the chemical attack on Douma in Syria dominates the front pages again today. The Guardian leads with the US president’s warning to Assad: “‘Heinous’ Syria attack could spark US military response, warns Trump.” The Telegraph carries a piece written by Lord Hague, with the headline “Act now to stop chemical warfare”. The Times takes a more local approach with “May under pressure to join strikes on Assad”, while the FT sees it through the prism of market activity: “Russian stocks battered by new US sanctions and Syria conflict.”Away from the Syrian attack, the Mail claims a campaign victory in the war on prostate cancer, the Express goes with workplace discrimination suffered by people with diabetes and the Sun splashes on death threats made to an elderly man who killed a burglar. And the Mirror has a story about Premier League stars being chased for a £250m tax bill.And a special award of some kind must go to the Telegraph, which found space on its front page to tell how the Queen had trouble hearing David Attenborough during a chat at Buckingham Palace due to planes passing overhead.

But the UK has narrowed its options and the talks will expose the lack of realism and contradictions in its negotiating position, and the isions within its ranks, Irish EU commissioner Phil Hogan warns.“Stepping into Global Britain is stepping into a difficult world. And there will be a huge gap between hope and experience,” he warns.The commissioner for agriculture and rural development will tell a Brussels Dublin City University (DCU) seminar on Monday morning , “an EU27 perspective on the future EU-UK relationship”, that “one thing we have already learned from Brexit is that the UK does not have a better idea: it does not have a replacement for the union as a way to improve the life quality of its citizens, its businesses, and its standing in the world.“Yes, it will leave the union but it only wants to go some of the way towards leaving. We can see, now that things have become clearer, that there is a lot of the union that the UK wants to retain. An awful lot.“You might say it doesn’t want to change its EU outfit, just its shoes.”He will say that in other circumstances prime minister Theresa May’s recent Munich speech would have been seen as a “a strong argument for joining, not leaving, the EU”. But he warns that the “long game” played by the UK in the negotiations means that the talks on a political statement on the framework of the future relationship, due to be finalised by this autumn alongside the withdrawal agreement, may not answer all the questions about the shape of that relationship. Mr Hogan will cast doubt on many of the assumptions that Ms May makes: “She is confident that regaining its power to negotiate trade agreements will enable the UK to achieve greater wellbeing for its people through wider trade. One hopes she is right for the sake of UK citizens.”But “Global Britain will mean for the United Kingdom a return to medium-sized nation status. Yes it will regain the sovereignty to seek and strike agreements where it wants but with reduced bargaining power, reduced security of its markets and supply chains, and a friction and cost added to each trade shipment to the EU, its biggest trade partner.”He warns that sterling could be very sensitive to new trade imbalances, that a deal with the US, particularly on agricultural products may not be as easy as expected, and that reliance on Commonwealth links will not be sufficient to compensate for a break with the EU – EU-UK trade is six times higher than UK exports to the 10 largest Commonwealth countries.The UK may also be disappointed in its hope to roll forward on current terms for existing trade agreements with third countries.On the outcome of talks, Mr Hogan warns that the EU is left with few options. “The EU might have its own preference between the three possible outcomes on a final agreement – free trade agreement, customs union, single market. We might have a preference but we have to realise that there is nothing we can do to realise it. The UK has decided that it wants a free trade agreement and that must be our focus.”Of the isions within Tory ranks, he says that “What I have called the London-London part of the negotiation has been a lively conversation between several opposing camps, although it is showing signs of calming recently.“This may be because the different camps are preparing for battles to come, or are concentrating on other things like the local elections on May 3rd, or consider the clock to have been reset to December 2020 by the draft withdrawal treaty. “It may be calmer but there does not seem to have been a reconciliation between the opposing camps.” Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456232.1523307553!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"blair-and-ahern-urge-governments-to-end-ni-impasse-1.3456234","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer US president Bill Clinton called on Northern politicians to follow the example of their predecessors and make compromises to allow the power-sharing institutions to be restored. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe British and Irish governments have been urged to devote greater energy to resolving the impasse in Northern Ireland by former taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former British prime minister Tony Blair, architects of the Belfast Agreement signed 20 years ago today.Both men said difficulties in resuscitating the power-sharing institutions could be overcome with more effort and focus, in separate interviews with The Irish Times to mark the agreement’s anniversary.Meanwhile, speaking at University College Dublin, former US president Bill Clinton warned that the present “paralysis” in the power-sharing institutions had a limit and could not go on indefinitely without endangering the settlement. He appealed to politicians in the North to “compromise” to find a way forward.Mr Ahern said: “If the two governments at top level give it total commitment I believe a deal can be done quickly.“I don’t see any reason why it can’t be done between now and the end of May if the will is there.”Mr Ahern said all the main political players in Dublin, London and Belfast were relatively new to their jobs, but that this meant that “Leo Varadkar and Theresa May have to get stuck in and work very hard to bring it all together”.“I know they have other big issues to deal with, notably Brexit, but that is not an excuse for not devoting all the time and energy required to the North,” Mr Ahern said.Echoing Mr Ahern’s views, Mr Blair said that difficulties between the Northern parties could be resolved and the power-sharing institutions could be restored with “more focus and work” by politicians.However, Mr Blair also said that voters in the North must demand that their representatives work the mechanisms of the agreement.“At the end of the day, the people of Northern Ireland have to stand up for this agreement at a certain point. They will also exert electoral pressure on the parties,” he said.“They have to make clear to their political leaders from whatever party they want them to find a way through this impasse and the agreement moving forward again. And the moderate parties will be the ones who are advocating this.”Mr Clinton called on Northern politicians to follow the example of their predecessors and make compromises to allow the power-sharing institutions to be restored.“In the end you have to be willing to give. Compromise has to be a good thing, not a dirty word,” Mr Clinton said. “And voters have to stop punishing the politicians who make those compromises and start rewarding them.”He was speaking at the Clinton Institute in UCD, set up to mark the former US president’s contribution to the peace process.The three men will travel to Belfast on Tuesday evening for an event at Queen’s University where they will join the former US senator George Mitchell, who chaired the talks in 1998, in a discussion about the agreement and its future.Meanwhile, three loyalist paramilitary groups, The Ulster Defence Association, Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando, yesterday issued a “declaration of transformation” on Monday, their first joint statement since the loyalist ceasefire in 1994, which suggests any members involved in crime will be expelled.“We fully support the rule of law in all areas of life and emphatically condemn all forms of criminal activity,” the statement said.Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456694.1523341596!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british-labour-politician-calls-belfast-agreement-a-shibboleth-1.3456240","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner described the agreement as a shibboleth. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesA senior member of the British Labour Party’s shadow cabinet has accused the Government of playing up the issue of the Border in Brexit negotiations for economic reasons and described the Good Friday Agreement as a “shibboleth”. Barry Gardiner, Britain’s shadow international trade secretary, told a conference in Brussels last month that fears that hardening the Border could bring a return to violence were confusing cause and effect.In a recording of his remarks, which The Irish Times has heard, he said the watchtowers and other physical infrastructure that had been built on the Border during the Troubles were removed 20 years ago to deprive terrorists of a target after the Belfast Agreement.“Now, we went back to that normal border relationship at a time when we were both - the UK and the Republic of Ireland - were in the EU, and so a normal border relationship was a completely friction-free border. “But that doesn’t mean that putting in a normal border relationship when one party is no longer in the EU will bring back paramilitary activity - that is to confuse cause and effect.“And I think we must also recognise that there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday agreement. And that is because it is hugely in the Republic of Ireland’s economic interest to make sure that there is no tariff and no external border there,” he said.Mr Gardiner was addressing a conference organised by the European trade union movement and the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, a political foundation attached to the German Left party, on March 20th. Mr Gardiner went on to ascribe political motives to Sinn Féin’s focus on the Border after Brexit.“And of course there are very good political reasons. Sinn Féin, who are members of this group and trusted colleagues, of course want to see the unification of Ireland and that is a political objective of Sinn Féin. “But it doesn’t mean that a normal border will bring back paramilitary activity. And so, these are deeply unfashionable remarks to make, but actually I do think that we do need to understand that there are economic reasons, there are political reasons, and they do not always concur with what we are putting forward - from all sides - as this shibboleth of the Good Friday Agreement. I think we need to actually start drilling down.”Mr Gardiner was not immediately available for comment but Owen Smith, who was sacked as Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary last month for advocating a second Brexit referendum, condemned the comments.“Labour members will be particularly shocked, but it should concern people in every party and none that there now seems to be a substantial group of senior politicians - from Daniel Hannan to Barry Gardiner - who are prepared to sacrifice the Good Friday Agreement in order to deliver Brexit. “Instead of supporting those in Northern Ireland committed to making the Agreement work, these ideological Brexiters put leaving the EU ahead of everything else. “They must be resisted by all those, who value the achievements of the Agreement, and above all the peace it has brought. If the choice is between Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement, we must support the Agreement every time,” Mr Smith said.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3455951.1523291713!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the-inside-story-of-how-the-belfast-agreement-was-struck-1.3455962","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer British prime minister Tony Blair and former taoiseach Bertie Ahern signing the Belfast Agreement. Photograph: ReutersWhen British prime minister Tony Blair left Downing Street in early April 1998 and headed for Belfast to take charge of the Northern Ireland peace talks with taoiseach Bertie Ahern, it seemed all was on the verge of ruin.The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) was poised to reject the first draft of US special envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell’s document on what would eventually become the Belfast Agreement, with the party’s deputy leader, John Taylor, famously declaring he would not touch it “with a 40-foot bargepole”.The Belfast Agreement would go on to become the cornerstone for peace in Northern Ireland, ushering in a new era of co-operation between unionists and nationalists both at the top table of government and in terms of the political structures that stemmed from it.By Tuesday, April 7th, UUP leader David Trimble had rung Blair three times at Downing Street before faxing him a letter rejecting the deal, citing a host of complaints. Later that day Blair arrived in Belfast with his private secretary John Holmes.What occurred over the following days would change the Irish political landscape forever. Yet exhaustion and the speed of events meant that much of the detail leading to the signing of the agreement on April 10th – Good Friday – 1998, has up to now been unknown as no comprehensive minutes were known to have been kept.However, Holmes, who was blessed with good shorthand, did keep a record, which has recently been unearthed by journalist Eamon Mallie. While it is a British version of events, it is one that provides much new insight into the see-saw nature of the talks and the personalities that shaped them.“The situation looked bleak as we arrived,” Holmes wrote.Mitchell’s decision to include two long, unagreed annexes covering North-South co-operation and sections on rights, policing and prisoners, which unionists had not seen before, had pushed them “over the edge” and were “too green for their taste”, Holmes recorded.The British moved swiftly, inviting Trimble to Hillsborough to hear his concerns. “With the important exceptions of the North-South section and decommissioning, these objections did not seem insuperable,” said Holmes. “As important, he still seemed interested in a deal.”They were joined at Hillsborough by Mitchell, who agreed to sweeping changes to his draft to get the unionists on board. They worked through the night on amendments to present to the Irish side the following morning.When Ahern arrived from Dublin for breakfast, Blair outlined the landscape. “Ahern made clear in response that he and his team were ready to have a crack at amending the paper, in particular the North-South part,” wrote Holmes. “But he also stressed his own difficulties, and his fear that if one unionist set of demands was met, another one would quickly appear.”Ahern then returned to Dublin for his mother’s funeral.Holmes said the Irish delegation had been “shaken” by the unionist reaction, and were ready to make “significant changes”. The disputed annexes in Mitchell’s draft were shelved,“The process, therefore, looked as if it might get back on track,” noted Holmes.The agreement sets out a framework for the creation of a number of institutions across three so-called “strands”.Strand one dealt with the democratic institutions, and established the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, while strand two dealt with cross-Border political co-operation such as a North-South ministerial council. The final strand concerned “east-west” issues and institutions to be created between Ireland and Britain.Holmes wrote that there was “great concern” on the nationalist side that unionists were refusing to engage on strand one issues until their concerns about strand two matters were addressed.By prior agreement with Ahern, Blair did not give the UUP the new strand two text “for fear of simply triggering further unionist demands”, wrote Holmes.Ahern would not get back from Dublin until the early evening, and a “frustrating period” followed with no real negotiations. Until Ahern could prove to the unionists that the Irish were up for serious change the process was “effectively stuck”.“When he eventually did arrive for a bilateral with the prime minister, the initial atmosphere was chilly because the Irish mistakenly thought we had been trying to negotiate with Mitchell behind their back over policing and decommissioning,” said Holmes.“Apologies from the prime minister quickly restored relations, and Ahern confirmed he was ready to sign up to the paper on strand two, contingent on the unionists being ready to do a reasonable deal on other issues, notably strand one.This was followed by a crucial tripartite meeting with the unionists. Ahern made clear he was ready to make compromises.“Trimble appreciated Ahern’s return to Belfast from his mother’s funeral and suggested both sides’ political needs could be met,” Holmes recorded, adding that in “a critical intervention” John Taylor now said he thought “proper business could now be done”.It was, therefore, agreed that the UUP and Irish should meet to try to reach agreement on North-South issues. “We subsequently gave the UUP the new text, suggesting that we thought the Irish would be ready to sign up to it,” said Holmes.“The UUP and Irish eventually met late that evening for a long and evidently tense discussion. It did not focus on the new text, as we had hoped, but on the difficult issues.“It was agreed that both sides would go away overnight to draft words to reflect their respective ideas. Some of the Irish side seemed encouraged by the meeting, but Ahern himself commented that it had finished just in time, before blows were exchanged.”“He feared the delay would make things worse – a fear which proved amply justified the following morning. But Ahern was clearly too tired for an all-night session to be possible.”Later that evening Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams came in to see Blair on his own. “He was friendly and philosophical as always, but his underlying message was worrying,” said Holmes, “Sinn Féin wanted to sign up to a deal, but we had to give them a deal they could sign up to.”That had to mean more than the release of prisoners.Blair asked John Hume and Mallon immediately afterwards if they thought Sinn Féin would sign up. Both thought Adams genuinely wanted to do so. But this question was to be a constant preoccupation for the next 36 hours: “We eventually returned to Hillsborough after midnight, frustrated that so little progress had been made.”Early on Thursday, Blair rang Trimble to again say he thought a deal on strand two was possible but that the Irish were in a fragile state. He “should not therefore push his luck too far on other issues”, Blair told Trimble, “and should in particular engage quickly with the SDLP on strand one”. Trimble said he understood.Shortly afterwards, over breakfast with Blair, Ahern voiced his “extreme suspicion” about unionist intentions, recalling past failures to honour promises made in 1921 and 1973. Westminster legislation was needed to ensure that NorthSouth bodies would be created. “The Irish also showed further concern about Sinn Féin’s position,” Holmes added.Back in Castle Buildings at Stormont, a “frustrating morning” passed. “We had assumed both the Irish and UUP had been drafting overnight, but in fact neither had, and a long gap followed,” said Holmes.“It gradually became clear that the two were not capable of solving their problems bilaterally – the mutual distrust and hostility were too great. From now until virtually the end of the talks, we negotiated with both by proxy, and kept them apart.”At midday Trimble brought Blair and Holmes the unionist draft, and “made clear” it would have to be the basis of any deal. He also said decommissioning would be “a show-stopper”.Blair put the proposal to Ahern and “pushed him hard”. The taoiseach accepted that the basis of a deal was there, but again sought Westminster guarantees.Department of Foreign Affairs secretary general Dermot Gallagher studied the text in detail, and suggested more changes. Blair then put the amendments to Trimble, who accepted the essential ones. “A deal appeared to have been struck on strand two, and a breakthrough achieved,” said Holmes.Strand One negotiations now began in earnest, but problems soon appeared. “Word began to reach us of serious difficulties about the new text in the Irish camp ... and unhappiness on the part of Sinn Féin and the SDLP,” wrote Holmes.“It was a disaster. The Irish had altered the balance fundamentally, reintroducing the necessity for Westminster legislation throughout the text, and putting all the responsibility in the hands of the two governments. There was fury on our side that the deal had so quickly fallen apart.”Blair quickly told Ahern the text could not be seriously reopened, but he was ready to see if the UUP would accept lesser changes. He met Trimble and Taylor, and put the Irish changes to them. They accepted four of the six changes, believing that they did not fundamentally alter the balance of the text.“The Irish were in turn satisfied,” said Holmes, “The deal seemed to be back on, and attention could switch back to the wider problem of whether Sinn Féin would sign up to a deal, not least since Ahern had made it increasingly clear that a deal would be almost impossible for the Irish if they did not.“Ahern had already spent hours with Adams trying to persuade him the deal was worth accepting, and listening to Sinn Féin demands for improvements, particularly on policing, security, the Irish language and prisoners,” he wrote.Northern secretary Mo Mowlam had spent much of the previous two days on the latter subject, with the British side “deliberately refusing to reveal our hand”, he said.However, Sinn Féin’s public line had turned negative. Fearing collapse, there were “two very long meetings” with just Blair and Ahern on one side, and Adams and Martin McGuinness on the other. This was followed by a 3am telephone call to Adams from US president Bill Clinton, which “seemed to turn the tide”.“It eventually became clear early in the morning of April 10th that, while they would not sign up to the deal on the spot, not least because of their annual conference a week later, they were ready to make positive noises about it and argue for it.“It was made clear in return that while we would stick for now to the planned two-year release deadline for prisoners, we would be ready to advance this if Sinn Féin did sign up and circumstances allowed.”Early on Friday morning the UUP accepted the essence of what they had rejected for so long: a Northern Ireland Executive with a first minister and deputy first minister, and a reasonable form of sufficient cross-community consensus for voting on key issues.“Exhaustion was combined with a degree of satisfaction and optimism,” said Holmes. “But we were also uncomfortably aware that there was bound to be a last-minute obstacle, and the UUP would no doubt find reasons to dislike the texts.”A mini-crisis then arose over the annex listing the areas where separate or joint North-South implementation bodies would be set up. The Irish were unhappy since just 12 were proposed, together with the fact that few of them were what they had wanted.They claimed to have persuaded the UUP during the night to accept an Irish language promotion body and a trade Promotion and indigenous company development body, both of which the UUP had fiercely resisted. “We stupidly took their word for it,” said Holmes.“When the UUP saw the new list they blew a fuse, accused the Irish of duplicity and refused to accept any more than the original list. The Irish in turn dug in their heels, and a lengthy impasse followed, with Mitchell (whose role in the previous 48 hours had effectively been zero) unable to circulate a new text and getting increasingly angry.“We were also tearing our hair out. Eventually the prime minister brought Ahern and Trimble together again. Trimble had been given fierce instructions by his colleagues not to accept another body or not to bother coming back. He was adamant. Ahern pressed, but in vain.“Eventually Trimble, at his most boorish, was persuaded to propose again a pretty meaningless health body. We sold this to an unhappy Ahern on the basis of an additional reference in the text to other bodies being considered and an exchange of letters with Trimble where Ahern set out four Irish requests again, and Trimble agreed to consider them later.“This fudge allowed the text to be circulated around midday. We sat back and waited for the next problems,” Holmes added.They were not long in coming. First, the UUP insisted the Anglo-Irish secretariat at Maryfield be closed by the end of the year, but the Irish resisted further concessions to the UUP.“Faced with the prospect of selling to their community a deal involving Sinn Féin at the Assembly and government table with no guarantee of decommissioning, with all prisoners out in two years...they were losing their nerve.”Blair spoke to Trimble several times by phone. “We deployed all the big picture arguments we could,” said Holmes. “But Trimble still seemed to be losing the argument and to share most of his colleagues’ reservations. It began to look hopeless, and despair took hold.”Trimble eventually brought a senior UUP delegation to see Blair. “All effectively said the text was unacceptable and unsaleable to unionists,” said Holmes. “The prime minister let his despair show but said he was ready to help if he could, but not by reopening the text itself.“The delegation made clear that the single biggest issue was the prospect of sitting round the cabinet table with Sinn Féin when there had been no decommissioning. The prime minister promised to consider this.“When they had left we concocted a letter to Trimble making clear that, if after six months of the Assembly the present rules to promote non-violent methods had proved ineffective, we would support changing the rules to give them teeth.“We sent this off without much hope, and meanwhile enlisted Clinton’s help through a direct phone call to Trimble. The cause still looked all but hopeless, although Trimble had said one or two things which suggested he was determined to make his colleagues swallow the agreement.”Suddenly, at about 4.30pm, the picture changed again. “Rumours reached us that, following the prime minister’s letter and Clinton’s call, Trimble had taken renewed heart and called a vote, which he had narrowly won.“This seemed too good to be true, but Trimble quickly rang to confirm that the way was now clear for the plenary to be held, and Mitchell arranged it for 5pm.”The plenary itself was relatively devoid of drama. The vote was swift. “And that was it,” said Holmes. “There was no applause when sufficient consensus was achieved – just a stunned silence.”Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"social-affairs","story":"Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456036.1523296865!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alarm-at-apparent-lack-of-urgency-in-repeal-campaign-1.3456037","story":"Together for Yes, an umbrella group advocating a Yes vote in the upcoming referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment, launches its poster campaign in Dublin. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTogether for Yes co-director Grainne Griffin at the campaign launch on Dublin’s Mount Street on Monday morning.Photograph: Cyril Byrne The leaders of the Together for Yes campaign gathered in Dublin on Monday to publicise the launch of their postering campaign in advance of the referendum on May 25th.Cameras clicked as T-shirted activists ascended poles. But many of the poles the campaigners and workers decorated with their message already had competing messages – the anti-repeal campaigners had beaten them to it.In many cases, they had already been there for nearly a fortnight, since the day the referendum was formally called and it became legal to put up posters. For some repeal supporters, it was a worrying sign that they are weeks behind the anti-repeal campaigners – in publicity, fundraising, canvassing and implementing a campaign strategy.“No,” says Orla O’Connor, co-chair of the Together for Yes campaign. “We are exactly where we want to be, it’s exactly how we planned it.”As of this week, she says, groups are now canvassing in all parts of the country. They are crowdfunding a possible second national poster run. They are connecting with the political parties, and will be co-ordinating local canvass groups all over the country with them. They’ll be meeting Fine Gael campaign chair Josepha Madigan this week.“It was only in the last 10 days of the marriage equality referendum that a lot of the donations came in,” O’Connor says. “That only happens when people engage with the campaign and that’s only beginning now.”There are certainly similarities with the referendum campaign on same-sex marriage. But there are also differences, one of the main ones being that there wasn’t much of an organised campaign against the marriage proposal.By contrast, there is a very well-organised, well-funded and committed campaign against the abortion proposal.“The postering also helps us frame the debate,” says McGuirk. “The comparison with the situation in the UK is a very, very important comparison for us to make.”Campaign observers agree that the anti-repeal side has had the better of the early running.“Look at the No side, look at how they have constructed and progressed their message since January,” says one pro-repeal public affairs consultant, who has looked back over the campaign since January. “They’ve done it in a series of three-or four-week blocks. It’s all very disciplined, very clear. You know, the voices on the radio match the slogans on the posters and the leaflets coming through the doors. There’s a great message consistency.”Clearly, anti-abortion campaigners have been getting ready for this fight for a long time. But some repealers are wondering why they haven’t been preparing with the same urgency. It is not, after all, as if the referendum was a surprise.Privately, some anti-abortion figures say that they are a “bit mystified” by the repeal campaign so far.Nervous repealers do not entirely disagree with them.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3454902.1523211484!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"berlin-irish-campaign-to-repeal-eighth-amendment-1.3454909","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBanner at Bei Ruth, a warehouse hidden inside a bare industrial estate between Berlin’s erse Neukölln and Treptow areas. Photograph: Rachel LoxtonIf it wasn’t for a giant poster of a pair of knickers on the wall, it would look like a typical Friday night at a Berlin club.The poster, with “Repeal the 8th” written across it in red, is attached to the wall with masking tape. It brightens up Bei Ruth, a party warehouse hidden inside a bare industrial estate, sandwiched between Berlin’s erse Neukölln and Treptow areas.Tonight the venue has become a gathering for Irish people – more than 1,300km away from where the referendum on May 25th will take place.The referendum will ask voters if they want to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which grants equal right to life to the mother and unborn child.The Berlin-Ireland pro-choice solidarity group organised “Plugged in for Repeal” to highlight how people can vote in the referendum or campaign, as well as raise money and remove the stigma of abortion.Dozens of people have already arrived at 9.30pm. At the door a suggested donation of €5 or €10 encouraged.The atmosphere is intense but cheerful as conversation moves from serious talk on the effects of the Eighth Amendment to “soli shots” (solidarity shots) and homemade Guinness cake.Is this an occasion to celebrate or prepare for the fight ahead? Both it seems.Maebh Murphy, from Waterford, moved to Berlin in 2008. The 33 year old, who works in the music industry, co-founded the pro-choice group with Dervla O’Malley, in 2012.She says “the buzz” of the party is because the referendum is finally happening – and feels fairly positive about the outcome.Under Irish electoral law, Irish citizens retain their right to vote for 18 months after moving abroad. There is no postal vote from abroad so eligible voters must travel back to have their say.Although she can’t vote, Murphy wants to go back to Ireland with her husband, who’s from Cork, and their three-year-old daughter but is unsure if the family can afford it.Despite being fervently pro-choice, she can understand arguments on the other side.“I would never talk about a clump of cells because people in my family have gone through miscarriages,” she says. “I totally understand the different feelings towards it and I also think you can make your own choice yourself.”But she feels angry about pro-life lobbyists using children with Down syndrome in their campaigns.When she was pregnant, Murphy was given the choice of receiving a chromosome abnormalities test in Germany but decided against it.“It’s just really insulting to think that if you had the choice then the only choice you would make is to abort all the babies because this is not the case. People will still have kids.”Cora Quigley, from Dublin, moved to Berlin in January last year. The 28 year old’s time abroad is within the 18-month limit so she will fly back to vote and is doing all she can to raise the issue.“I’ve already had a discussion with my mother which went really well,” says Quigley. “It’s important to have conversations in your family because people don’t really talk about it. Even people who appear liberal in other ways might be on the fence.”PhD geography student Lorna O’Hara splits her time between her home city of Dublin and Berlin.The 30 year old, who can vote and will return, has also been having difficult conversations.“It’s hard to look at someone who you love and know their opinion is so different,” says O’Hara. “I’ve been an activist for six years, I know the facts. But when I sat down with my mother all of that flew out the window because you just fall apart.“I think it was the emotion in that conversation that got her to see it from my perspective.”Clíodhna Walsh, a writer from Waterford, says being unable to cast a postal vote is a major disadvantage. “I haven’t found a job yet in Berlin but I’m going to book flights anyway and hope for the best.”O’Hara says her beliefs were shaped by the convent school she attended where the main arguments she heard were against abortion.“A lot of people who are now pro-choice started out being pro-life.If you’re told something as a child you believe it.”As a doula who helps women in pregnancy and abortion, Kilkenny-born Jes Walsh struggles to see things from a pro-choice perspective.The 27 year old, who has been in Berlin for five years and will go back to Ireland to campaign, says: “I don’t see abortion as an act of violence. I see it as violence when you hold people back from their choices.”The group was launched six years ago after the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway due to the complications of a septic miscarriage.“We had quite a few protests outside the Irish Embassy and vigils,” says co-founder Dervla O’Malley, from Galway. “Every year on the anniversary of Savita’s death we hold a vigil.”O’Malley, who has been making sure the event runs smoothly, says the money raised will go to abortion rights and support groups in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.“This referendum is well overdue,” she says. “We’ve waited a long time for this.”Outside, the industrial estate is cold and grey – the opposite of the electric atmosphere among the Irish expats. Physically they are in Berlin. But these emigrants feel more connected to Ireland than ever.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456126.1523301181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"woman-happy-to-give-empty-room-in-her-house-to-syrian-refugee-1.3456131","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary O’Reilly outside her house in Baldoyle, Co Dublin,  with Syrian refugee Wassim Kharita. Photograph: CJ NashMary O’Reilly does not consider opening her home to a stranger a big deal. She grew up in a household of lodgers and knew the empty bedroom could be put to good use.The decision to pledge a room to a refugee was a no-brainer, she says.“I have a lovely house, the bedroom was here and I felt bad I wasn’t doing something. This, for me, was the easy way to help. As a child I grew up with lodgers people who worked in the local hospital, teachers and engineers. My mother had a mortgage to pay and was a widow, she needed the money. I was used to always having people around,” she said.“It wasn’t seeing the child on the beach that pushed me to do something, it happened before that. I think it was when I saw all the people on the television, the hoards of them fleeing across Europe until they were caught at fences and not allowed cross the borders. Something pulled at me, a realisation that it could have been me. You really are just a circumstance of your birth.”In September 2015, Mary joined more than 800 Irish people in pledging a room in her home to a refugee arriving in Ireland.The Government had committed to welcome up to 4,000 men, women and children into the country from camps in Greece, Italy and Lebanon and Irish people were eager to offer a helping hand to the new arrivals. However, nearly two years passed before Mary finally received a call from the Irish Red Cross asking her whether she’d like to house a Syrian man.“The wait was frustrating because there were all these students coming to Dublin looking for rooms. But I knew they would come eventually so I held on.”Mary had taken early redundancy from work to look after her mother who died a few years later. She was eager to put the empty bedroom to good use and immediately agreed to welcome Wassim Kharita.Wassim (26) arrived in Ireland from Greece in May 2016 with his teenage cousin. They had crossed the Aegean Sea by boat from Turkey in January leaving behind their families in Lebanon.Wassim grew up in the city of Al-Zabadani in a mountainous region in southwestern Syria close to the Lebanese border. His father worked as a carpenter and the family ran a farm where they grew apple and peach trees. “It used to be a visitor spot for tourists,” says Wassim.“Syria is not green like here but my city had many trees. We had lots of farming but there are no farms left now. All the green is gone and all our homes are gone. But I don’t cry about our homes because there were humans who died. You can always build another home when the war ends but humans cannot come back.”In 2013 his family fled to Lebanon and in 2016, Wassim and his cousin embarked on the journey to Europe.Mary and Wassim met briefly in July 2017 and the following week he moved into her home. She knew very little about him, only that he was 26 and had arrived from Greece the previous year.“What else did I need to know?” asks Mary. “I knew he’d been vetted and was already in Ireland more than a year when he moved into this house.“I wasn’t nervous at all,” she adds.Meanwhile, Wassim was trying to remember the advice he was given by a woman named Helen from the Department of Justice who helped him settle in during his initial weeks in Ireland. “She told me to look at people’s eyes because Irish people speak with their eyes. And it’s true.”Wassim now wakes each morning to a view of Ireland’s Eye with the Irish Sea stretching out towards the horizon. He takes English lessons during the day and works in an Arabic restaurant in Temple Bar at night.Wassim admits the initial weeks in Baldoyle were challenging but now he feels very settled. “It was hard at the start because my English was weak but now that I can talk it’s easier. I can feel it getting better and living in this house and working helps.”In November, Wassim’s parents and younger siblings arrived in Ireland after a Dutch artist living in Dublin offered to pay for their airfare. “When I saw my mum in Dublin Airport I hugged her for five minutes. She means so much to me, especially because I am the eldest son.”The family now live in Tullamore and Wassim visits them each weekend.Mary says having Wassim live in her home has broadened her mind and would encourage anyone who has considered offering a room to a refugee to take the leap and sign up.“It’s opened my world. I’ve learned so much about Syria from Wassim. Originally my friends thought I was a bit mad to take him in but now they admire me. What I’m doing is no big deal. I’ve just given him a bed.”Wassim says he is hugely grateful, not only to Mary, but to all the people who have supported and helped him since he arrived in Dublin.“Before I came to Ireland I didn’t know anything about Irish people. The weather is very different, everything is different here. But people here have been very friendly.”Read more on how Europe attempts to deal with the migrant crisisThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"real story anne craig coach accused encouraging false memories","story":"Anne Craig leaving the High Court in 2016What made two seemingly happy young women from loving homes sever all contact with their families and friends, renounce their inheritances and  vanish into thin air? Mick Brown investigates how a self-styled ‘personal development coach’ digging for ‘forgotten’ childhood memories opened a door to catastrophe Towards the end of 2016 I received a telephone call asking whether I would be interested in talking to a woman named Anne Craig.

finger bone suggests humans travelled east","story":"Excavations at the Al Wusta archaeological site in Saudi ArabiaAn ancient fragment of human finger bone found in the Saudi Arabian desert suggests that mankind ventured east out of Africa 30,000 years earlier than thought.The scrap of bone, measuring little more than an inch long, had lain undiscovered for up to 90,000 years.Its discovery potentially revolutionises our understanding of early human history, challenging a long-held consensus that humans started to move en masse into Eurasia in a single wave about 60,000 years ago.It is the latest in a series of archaeological finds that have questioned the conventional narrative, including the discovery of a jawbone in an Israeli cave said to date back 180,000 years.Prof Michael Petraglia, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, said: “What we\u0027re arguing here is that there were multiple dispersals out of Africa, so the process of the movement and the colonisation of Eurasia was far more complicated than our textbooks tell us.”“This find, together with other finds in last few years, suggests that modern humans, Homo sapiens, were moving out of Africa multiple times during many windows of opportunity during the last 100,000 years or so.”Four different views of a Homo sapiens fossil finger bone from the Al Wusta archaeological siteThe research team said the fossilised finger bone unquestionably belonged to a human and could be dated directly using radiometric technology.The fragment is thought to be the middle bone of a middle finger, likely of an adult.It was discovered in the Nefud Desert of Saudi Arabia in 2016 and analysed over two years.Tests revealed it was at least 85,000 years old - possibly 90,000 - making it the \u0026quotoldest directly-dated homo sapiens\u0026quot fossil ever found outside of Africa and the Levant.Huw Groucutt, the study’s co-author from the University of Oxford, said its age served as rare evidence that \u0026quotour species was spreading beyond Africa much earlier than previously thought.”It is the first fossil of a hominin - the group of humans and our direct ancestors - discovered in what is Saudi Arabia today.Humans were previously thought to have left Africa in a single wave, moving along the coast from Africa via southern Arabia and India all the way to Australia.But Prof Petraglia said the finger showed \u0026quotthat modern humans were moving across the interior, the terrestrial heart, of Eurasia - not along the coastlines.”The bone was discovered in an area known as Al Wusta that 90,000 years ago would have looked very different to the desert it is today, with plentiful rivers and lakes.It was found with a collection of 380 stone tools nearby, suggesting that groups of tens of humans would have been living at the site.The team also found fossils of various animals, including hippos, as well as advanced stone tools.They said it all pointed to the owner of the finger having been a member of a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer group moving after water and animals.Other archaeological finds, which some have claimed are even older, may very well be authentic but were not directly dated, the researchers said.Most had their age calculated from the sand or rock layers they were found in, or other items in the vicinity.The research is published in the journal Nature Ecology \u0026amp Evolution.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding cake: royal

urgently investigated research","story":"Unexplained weight loss has long been associated with cancerWeight loss in patients over the age of 60 should be urgently investigated, with one in seven cases among men likely to mean cancer, a major study has found.The research by Oxford University found that losing weight is the key symptom of the disease, linked to at least 10 types of cancer.Experts called on GPs to refer patients with unexplained weight loss for urgent tests, in a bid to speed up diagnosis.Britain’s survival rates are lagging behind may comparative countries, with the UK falling in the bottom half of international league tables for seven major forms of the disease.Unexplained weight loss has long been associated with cancer.But Tuesday’s research, involving more than 11 million patients, is the first major study to quantify the association.Overall it found that among those over 60, men with unintended weight loss had a 14.2 per cent risk of cancer, with a 6.7 per cent risk found among women of the same age.Experts said the higher rate among men was found because weight loss was closely linked to prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men.Lead author Dr Brian Nicholson, of the University of Oxford, said GPs needed to be able to refer patients to centres which could check for several cancers at once, in order to make the right diagnosis quickly.Last week health officials announced plans to test such an approach in 10 parts of the country.Dr Nicholson said: “Streamlined services that allow GPs to investigate non-specific symptoms like weight loss are vitally important and urgently needed if we are to catch cancer earlier and save lives.”He said more research was needed to establish the amount of weight loss which constituted grounds for concern.“Our research indicates that coordinated investigation across multiple body sites could help to speed up cancer diagnosis in patients with weight loss,” he said.“We now need to continue our research to understand the most appropriate combination of tests and to give guidance on how much weight loss GPs and patients should worry about.”.html-embed.component

said patient access to tests for cancer was among the lowest in EuropeA team led by the Universities of Oxford and Exeter examined 25 studies, involving 11.5 million patients.Their study, funded by the National Institute for Health Research and published in the British Journal of General Practice, found that unintended weight loss was the second highest risk factor for colorectal, lung, pancreatic and renal cancers.The only symptoms found to be more common were those linked to specific cancers, such as rectal bleeding, for bowel cancer, and jaundice for pancreatic disease.Co-author Professor Willie Hamilton, from the University of Exeter, said: “We’ve always known that unplanned weight loss may represent cancer. This study pulls together all the published evidence and demonstrates beyond doubt that it is important in efforts to save lives from cancer.”Everything you need to know about prostate cancer but were too afraid to GoogleDr Richard Roope, clinical lead for cancer at the Royal College of GPs, said: \u0026quotCurrently there are no clinical guidelines to support GPs and their teams in how to respond to or investigate patients who present with weight loss, without other symptoms, in the cancer setting.\u0026quotThese important findings present strong evidence of the correlation between significant unexplained weight loss and many cancers, and should certainly be taken on board as clinical guidelines for GPs and healthcare professionals are updated and developed.\u0026quotWe agree with the researchers\u0027 recommendations that GPs need better access to diagnostic tools in the community across the UK so that we can appropriately refer patients to either rule out or confirm a diagnosis of cancer, as currently our access is among the lowest in Europe.\u0026quotA spokesperson for NHS England said: “Rapid and accurate diagnosis is vital for all cancers. Patients are now being tested sooner with investment in greater diagnostic capacity including in one-stop cancer diagnostic services across the country.\u0026quotThese new one-stop-shops represent a real step change in the way people with unclear symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, appetite loss or abdominal pain are identified, diagnosed and treated.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding cake: royal bakes through the agesComment: The Left doesn\u0026#39t care to ask why Hungary\u0026#39s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is genuinely popularSmog forces South Korean pupils to practise virtual sports indoorsKim Jong-un breaks silence on talks with Donald TrumpChina\u0026#39s president Xi Jinping promises to cut car import tariffs and open economyTrump Tower fire victim \u0026#39hated living in Donald Trump\u0026#39s building\u0026#39The Simpsons\u0026#39 response to Apu racism row angers criticsTrump tax cuts forecast to send US deficit to $1 trillion in 2020Police officer was moonlighting as a prostitute while on sick leave from \u0026#39sex scandal\u0026#39 forcePolice failing to keep track of all violent knife crimeFBI raids offices of Donald Trump\u0026#39s lawyer Michael CohenWorld\u0026#39s \u0026#39hottest chilli\u0026#39 gives man five weeks of excruciating headachesBritish scientists in race to find lost shipwreck of Ernest Shackleton\u0026#39s EnduranceQueen\u0026#39s conversation drowned out by noisy plane as she chats with Sir David AttenboroughDonald Trump says \u0026#39major decision\u0026#39 coming on Syria as US Navy destroyer heads to regionCanada town gets new shock as dead player misidentifiedTwitter users hit by \u0026#39over capacity\u0026#39 problem and immediately post complaints on, erm, TwitterTheresa May unveils war on prostate cancer  Syrian government celebrated after targeting and killing Marie Colvin, defector claimsWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "}]
