In the CCTV footage, the white trailer comes into view on the top of the screen as it careers along the motorway on the border of Surrey and Kent. It continues to zigzag across the carriageway as all other drivers come to a near standstill         It appears to have suffered severe damage to its front end as it comes closer into view. As a result, there were five miles of tailbacks with delays of around 40 minutesAlthough it happened in May, Highways England has only just released the footage as part of its \u0027check it before towing it\u0027 campaign. There are around 4,000 incidents every year involving all forms of trailers, which equated to around 11 per day in 2017.Highways England wants anyone towing before setting off to ensure they have the correct licence and insurance to tow whatever the weight.Motorists also need to make sure that the vehicle is connected correctly and that the load is secure and within the limits for the vehicle. "},{"url":null,"title":"Taylor Swifts father deletes private Facebook account","story":"Share this article Last night the ABC show\u0027s Twitter account shared footage of Scott Swift helping Taylor\u0027s entourage to deliver pizza to fans who had camped out to see her.  The posts purportedly found on her father\u0027s Facebook included a meme about paying taxes and listing illegal immigrants as dependents.\u0027The IRS has returned my tax return to me this year after I apparently answered one of the questions incorrectly... In response to the question, \u0027Do you have anyone dependent on you?\u0027 I wrote: \u00279.5 million illegal immigrants, 1.1 million crack heads, 3.4 million unemployable scroungers, 80,000 criminals in over 85 prisons plus 650 idiots in Washington\u0027. The IRS stated the answer I gave was \u0027unacceptable!\u0027,\u0027 the meme read.         Swift, who has previously said there are \u0027political undertones\u0027 in her new music, is set to release her widely anticipated new album on Friday night         One of the memes, which fans allege were shared by Scott Swift, declares that \u0027I no longer recognize this person as a Senator\u0027 over a picture of Elizabeth Warren         A further post in 2016 read: \u0027So sad to hear of the passing of Nancy Reagan.

Wrapped phone in a towel, secured with rubber bands and put it in dryer on \u0027cool\u0027. Put 10,000 steps on the phone, watching golf. Feel great. They were right!,\u0027 he said. In a Tumblr post, Taylor Swift seemingly shared her father\u0027s joke, leading fans to his Facebook page. \u0027This man must be stopped,\u0027 she said, joking about \u0027parents on the loose\u0027 and \u0027no more guitar picks for him\u0027.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Sean Spicer says AGREES DWTS politics free needs conservatives vote him","story":"Share this articleShare this articleSean Spicer speaks out on \u0027DWTS\u0027 casting, gets his first dance lesson on \u0027Fox \u0026amp Friends\u0027 | On Air Videos | Fox NewsSean Spicer Responds to Critics of Dancing With the StarsSean Spicer Responds to \u0027Dancing With the Stars\u0027 Backlash | Hollywood Reporter"},{"url":null,"title":"Ed Sheeran turns home town massive festival venue","story":"Share this article He wrote: \u0027Today the Divide tour broke the all time tour record set by U2.

Balpa represents roughly 90 per cent of BA\u0027s 4,311 pilots, the majority of whom are based at London Heathrow.BA said 1,061 pilots did not vote for the strike, which means roughly three quarters of its pilots are expected to protest. In a statement, the airline said: \u0027It is completely unacceptable that Balpa is destroying the travel plans of tens of thousands of our customers with this unjustifiable strike action.         British Airways pilots will walk out for three days next month in an escalating row over their pay\u0027We are extremely sorry that after many months of negotiations, based on a very fair offer, Balpa has decided on this reckless course of action.\u0027BA said it is \u0027doing everything it can\u0027 to mitigate the disruption, and is looking at options including hiring aircraft and crew from rivals, and scheduling larger planes to carry more passengers.But it said it is \u0027likely that many of our customers will not be able to travel\u0027. Mr Cruz apologised for the disruption the strikes will cause, and said passengers would be contacted in 24 to 36 hours.Passengers whose flights are cancelled will be offered refunds or the chance to re-book for free.Flights on BA CityFlyer, SUN-AIR and Comair will not be affected by the strikes. Adam French, Consumer Rights Expert at Which?, said: \u0027Many affected passengers may also be eligible for compensation as these strikes are led by airline staff.\u0027Balpa has warned of further strike dates if the row is not resolved. It said strike action will cost BA around £40million a day and but only £5million to give in to its pay demands.Balpa disputed BA\u0027s pay figures and said many pilots – particularly co-pilots, or first officers – are paid well under £100,000. It said entry-level pilots are paid £26,000 while saddled with training debts of up to £100,000.The union orchestrated a two-day strike by Ryanair over pay, which ended yesterday with minimal impact on passengers as the airline had pilots who were not involved in the dispute step in.   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0dc793b7c2b0986baf6fe69720825eb1680d983/0_525_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0942b731bf064f247912e0e8d8d000a","title":"share your best photographs of the week with us","story":"We’re highlighting the best reader photography in print in the letters pages of the .

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

I personally believe BA pilots are the best in the world … But I think they have been very badly served by the union.”A BA captain earns an average of £167,000 and, with allowances and bonuses, would pass £200,000 per year after the three-year pay deal, Cruz said.He added that the airline would be contacting affected passengers within the next 36 hours, but passengers could make their own re-bookings now online, and that cancellations were bound to occur. BA plans to hire planes and crew from other airlines, and schedule larger aircraft on codeshare flights – where two or more airlines share the same flight – to allow as many passengers as possible to travel.BA sought an injunction to stop the strike, but its claim was rejected in the high court and again at appeal last month.• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d86d4f70b0f891e6ec77cc157012aa14549907e/0_156_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff45c31f0ba1c1d229e77d0d64a6a836","title":"deutsche bank to pay 16m us princelings case","story":"Regulator had said it corruptly hired unqualified relatives of foreign officials to win businessDeutsche Bank has agreed to pay a $16m (£13m) fine to US authorities overallegations that it hired unqualified relatives of powerful Russian and Chinese government officials to win business.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that Germany’s largest lender had used false books to record the hirings, which meant the relatives – known in China as “princelings” – did not have to go through rigorous interview processes.In one case, the son of an executive from a Russian state-owned company was transferred from Moscow to London but failed to turn up to work, cheated in an exam and was described as a liability.The SEC alleged that the hiring of poorly qualified relatives was in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Deutsche Bank did not admit or deny the findings under the settlement.The charges centred on activities between 2006 and 2014, when the relatives were hired in the Asia–Pacific and Russia region with the primary goal of generating business for the company, such as through initial public offerings.The SEC found that Deutsche Bank employees had created false records that concealed the corrupt hiring practices and had failed to accurately document and record certain related expenses.Five examples were used to illustrate the charges, including the son of a senior Russian executive who failed to turn up to work, and was described as “a liability to the reputation of the program, if not their firm”.A London-based human resources employee is alleged to have sent a email about the son saying that: “FYI . . . the classic nepo situation that we have every year.” Two months later the HR person suggested the bank fire the son because “he failed to come to work, cheated on an exam,” the SEC alleged.In another example, the bank hired the daughter of a “deputy minister” at a Russian state-owned company as an intern in Moscow and subsequently transferred her to London. “We must do it! We should have her in London as it is NOT politically correct to have her in Moscow!” the head of the bank’s Russian office is alleged to have told his UK bosses, according to the SEC.The SEC said Deutsche Bank had taken extensive measures to fix its hiring compliance and internal accounting controls. A bank spokesman said: “Deutsche Bank provided substantial cooperation to the SEC in its inquiry and has implemented numerous remedial measures to improve the bank’s hiring practices.” The $16m settlement includes a penalty of $10.8m, interest of $2.4m and a $3m civil penalty. The settlement is less than those imposed on other banks that have been accused of similar behaviour. In 2016, JPMorgan was penalised $264m and Credit Suisse last year agreed to pay $77m.In a separate development, Deutsche Bank is to transfer 800 people to BNP Paribas as part of a deal in which the French bank will take its prime brokerage operations.Deutsche Bank said in July it had struck a preliminary agreement with BNP covering the business that serves hedge funds as part of a €7.4bn (£6.7bn) overhaul, but details on personnel and the timing of any final deal were being hammered out.The German bank has said it is eager to clinch a deal sooner rather than later to “provide continuity of service” to its clients, at a time when some have been leaving. Hedge fund clients have balances of close to $200bn with Deutsche.Most of the staff affected are based in London and New York. A successful deal with BNP will mean Deutsche will not have to pay redundancy for those iniduals as it seeks to cut about 18,000 jobs globally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4338b4782e861fcd6c062cedb57350576947a7/0_0_4062_2437/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5f78405718f417f6547b99a848d39d0","title":"greggs to develop vegan versions of all its bestselling foods","story":"Chief executive says people want more vegan options, after success of Quorn sausage roll Greggs is working on vegan versions of all its bestselling products, from steak bakes to pasties and doughnuts, as the high-street baker looks to repeat the runaway success of its vegan sausage roll.The Quorn-filled roll, which launched in January, was so successful that Greggs had to increase production to satisfy demand. The sales boom also increased profits, with the business going back to City investors several times last year to say it was making more money than it had expected.Greggs’ chief executive, Roger Whiteside, upped the ante on Friday when he revealed its developers were working on vegan recipes for all of its most popular products.“We are working away to see if we can come up with a version of all our bestselling lines because people want vegan options,” Whiteside told LBC. “If we can produce something that tastes just as good as the meat version, then that will sell very successfully. That’s what’s been shown with the vegan sausage roll.”Last month Whiteside told reporters the company was working on a vegan doughnut and plant-based milks but he refused to drawn on what the next big launch would be, saying: “That would be giving away everything to our competitors.” Greggs, which sells 1.5m traditional pork sausage rolls a week, is benefiting from the growing number of Britons who choose to eat less meat or have switched to a plant-based diet. In recent years there has been a huge uptake of veganism in the UK with the number increasing from 150,000 in 2014 to 600,000 in 2018, according to the Vegan Society.The filling in the vegan roll is a fungus-based protein that is mass-produced by the meat-free specialist Quorn Foods in its factory near Darlington, County Durham. Sales were given an early boost by Piers Morgan, who turned it into a national talking point by tweeting that Greggs bosses were “PC-ravaged clowns” for putting it on the menu. Greggs’ own Twitter account responded with: “Oh hello Piers, we’ve been expecting you.”Greggs, which was founded by John Gregg as a Tyneside bakery in 1939, has been completely reinvented by Whiteside, who took charge five years ago. The former Ocado and Marks \u0026amp Spencer executive saw the writing was on the wall for its traditional bakery model as changing shopping habits meant Britons were increasingly buying their bread at the supermarket.Whiteside overhauled the menu, adding healthier options such as soups and wraps as well as speciality coffees and breakfast options including porridge and granola, enabling it to move into the booming food-to-go market, which is worth more than £18bn a year.The new approach helped the no-frills retailer win over “Greggs rejectors”, as Whiteside calls them, and turned it into a serious rival for chains such as Pret a Manger. Its latest plan is to enter the takeaway dinner market, keeping its shops open until 9pm.Whiteside says the vegan sausage roll has helped change the perception of Greggs from “an old-fashioned bakery from the north” to a “modern food-on-the-go brand”. “The thing that people misinterpret in the UK market is that if it’s low price it must be low quality,” he said in a recent interview. “But customers are wising up to that because of what I call the Aldi Lidl effect. Low price doesn’t have to be low quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ed093e0115365267d92a2d310d08f0ab635b1ab/0_208_4747_2849/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f0ed812cf265622b2dd257d91cb0c39","title":"mark carney dollar dominant replaced digital currency","story":"Bank of England governor says stockpiling dollars has become a barrier to global tradeThe Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has challenged the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency, arguing that it could be replaced by a global digital alternative to end a savings glut that resulted in 10 years of low inflation and ultra-low interest rates.Likening the move to the end of sterling’s command of international money markets 100 years ago, Carney said the dollar had reached a level of dominance that meant it was a barrier to a sustainable recovery.He said a new digital currency backed by a large group of nations would unlock dollar funds that governments currently hoard as an insurance policy in uncertain times.Governments stockpile dollars to insure against swings in the US economy, which in recent times have intensified, leading to a significant rise in the cost of borrowing.The Chinese currency, the renminbi, has been cited as an alternative to the dollar along with proposed digital currencies such as Facebook’s Libra. Carney said neither was in a position to take over from the dollar, but new technologies could allow for a global digital currency to challenge the US currency.Digital currencies have attracted the attention of central banks in the past year as the prospect of mobile business and consumer transactions has become more popular.Earlier this year the Bank of England welcomed Facebook’s Libra initiative, which was seen as a challenge to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bank officials said the initiative, which was backed by several banks, could be a useful addition to trading goods and services.A succession of central banks have criticised Libra, however, saying it lacks the rules and regulations to be a reliable currency. The European commission opened an anti-trust investigation into Libra earlier this week, saying it feared the private digital currency could could unfairly disadvantage rivals and be open to abuse.In what appeared to be a warmer response to Libra, Carney said: “Retail transactions are taking place increasingly online rather than on the high street, and through electronic payments over cash.“The most high-profile of these has been Libra, a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin fully backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including the US dollar, the euro and sterling. It could be exchanged between users on messaging platforms and with participating retailers.“There are a host of fundamental issues that Libra must address, ranging from privacy to operational resilience. In addition, depending on its design, it could have substantial implications for both monetary and financial stability.”Carney said the UK economy was suffering from several years of under-investment, mostly in response to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. A further deterioration in GDP growth could force the Bank’s monetary policy committee to cut interest rates, he said. Carney would be minded to cut in the event of a downturn brought on by a no-deal departure from the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab28a105e7e5ba0aa0d9cd9bdb6c2494bc9bc137/0_276_2383_1430/master/2383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c35f40e2f3ca110a077e4744c1f9f36","title":"prince andrew appalled epstein royal wedding","story":"Perhaps a royal wedding for Princess Beatrice might offer a welcome distraction for a man-of-the-world under unfair scrutinyWaa waa waa. What could be a more effective heartstring-tugger than “other European princes have it better than me”? It’s right up there with Chandler’s line from Friends: “My wallet’s too small for my 50s, and my diamond shoes are too tight!”The scene is recalled in an email revealed by Brockman’s soon-to-be former client, the tech author Evgeny Morozov. He is one of many esting themselves of even tenuous Epstein association in the wake of the billionaire financier’s suicide in a Manhattan jail earlier this month, as he awaited trial for sex trafficking, underage and otherwise.But what of Andy? Under some scrutiny, he and ex-wife Duchess Fergie private-jetted away from Balmoral last week, then on to the luxury bit of Sotogrande, where they are said to be gracing private barbecues. Briefings suggest, distractingly, that they might be getting back together. Andrew has been snapped on an exclusive golf course. His daughter Princess Beatrice might be getting engaged to her boyfriend. “They’re going to get married,” royal expert Ingrid Seward declared this week, ertingly. “I was told by a member of the family.” So, on go the Yorks. It really is the full fairytale. By which I mean: fairly Grimm.Back to the foot massage scene, then, where the chaps seem to have got on to Prince Albert’s night-time freedom via the subject of Julian Assange. Brockman reports Andy saying: “We think they’re liberal in Sweden, but it’s more like northern England as opposed to southern Europe.” Is the implication that Swedish authorities investigating sexual assault allegations are being illiberal?Either way, you don’t get all that nanny state stuff on Epstein’s private Virgin Islands property, reportedly known locally as “Paedophile Island”. Or as Buckingham Palace finally put it in a statement denying any impropriety on behalf of the prince: “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes.”I’m slightly sorry for the royal flunkies who had to issue this line, given that most of us are suffering eyeball strain from all the rolling we’re doing. Even so, I do feel we need further clarification on what precisely the Duke is appalled by. Is it just the “recent reports”? Because if we’re meant to believe that Prince Andrew is appalled by ALL of the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein – both the ones alleged and the ones he served actual jail time for – then allow me to treat this statement with all the dignity it deserves. To wit: BULL. SHIT. Bullshit Prince Andrew didn’t know what sort of guy his friend was when he was snapped walking with the Tier 1 sex offender, after he got out of jail, in a photo the New York Post headlined “PRINCE \u0026amp PERV”. Bullshit he didn’t know why his close friend WENT TO PRISON FOR A YEAR, but kept hanging out with him anyway. Bullshit if, as Brockman recounts, he lay on his back in that guy’s house, with a Russian attending to his feet, talking over her head to men of the world about the nocturnal licence afforded to minor European royals, and he didn’t know roughly what he was swimming in. Bullshit. I get we have to pay for Andrew’s lifetime of jollies but we don’t have to have our intelligence insulted by him.I’m not even going to wheel out that old writing device where one says that either Prince Andrew is stupid or deeply compromised, and wonder archly which it is. Guys, he can be both! In fact, the one feeds the other.The plain fact is that Andrew continued to be friends with Epstein even after he pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution. I guess it was the old she-said, he-said thing. Or as the then-Palm Beach police chief put it: “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the shes all basically told the same story.” Obviously, Epstein got away lightly with his grotesque plea deal, because 50-something:1 isn’t the ratio you need. Even last year, they still needed 60 accusers to stop Bill Cosby. Donald Trump’s 17:1 she-he ratio is nowhere near enough to keep him from the highest office on the planet.As for where we go from here, perhaps a multimillion-pound royal wedding would indeed be helpful. It should be quite the opposite. Where Princess Anne pointedly didn’t, Prince Andrew demanded all the titles and trappings for his two daughters – security details, civil list money, full royal weddings – and was furious when denied some of them. Yet Beatrice and Eugenie still live like … well, princesses.So instead of distracting from the miserable stories of the female attendees of various Epstein mansions, these gilded lives should throw them into even more shameful relief. They suggest the kind of man, and we’ve all met them, who has a two-tier view of the female sex. There is a world for their daughters, hopefully insulated from men like their friend Jeffrey – and then there is another world for girls who service their friend Jeffrey.Yet decent, humane people know there aren’t two kinds of women and girls – there are just women and girls. I’m reminded of the climactic line in All My Sons, where the wartime profiteer Joe Keller has been finally made – by his own son’s suicide note – to see how his actions were responsible for the fate of so many other young men. “I think to him they were all my sons,” Keller reflects. “And I guess they were. I guess they were.”And so with the girls in the stories that swirl around Epstein and his circle, which includes the Duke: either broken, or yet-to-be-broken. But ultimately, breakable. They are all daughters, too, your Royal Highness. The Russian masseuse on your feet, the 17-year-old runaway on whose bare hip you have your hand in that fateful picture in London, the terrified 14-year-old who ran screaming from your great friend’s house in her underwear, who you must have read about at the time, because I did, and I didn’t even know the guy. And all the others. They are each someone’s daughter, or they were once. They all once played at princesses and castles and imagined their own fairytale weddings. Funny how dreams die, isn’t it – and who helps to crush them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8552371f658324117142a2738d2714d0b521b17b/0_251_4100_2459/master/4100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a026d2ca110e3697a869f8d6f6b2120e","title":"the guardian view on the global economy opportunities wasted","story":"Rarely has there been more need of collective action on the world’s problems than at the G7 summit hosted by Emmanuel Macron in Biarritz this weekend. Rarely have the chances of success appeared so miserably low. The G7 is supposed to be the forum where the west’s leading nations get to grips with thorny economic and political issues, and even though life has moved on since a previous French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, hosted the first get-together at Rambouillet in 1975, there is plenty to talk about. Three subjects scream out for attention: protectionism, Brexit and the climate emergency.As in the mid-1970s, the global economy is not in good shape. Growth is slowing and there is a hint of recession in the air. In two G7 members – Germany and the UK – output is falling in a third, Italy, it is stagnant. Around the world, factories are operating at much less than full capacity.The drift towards protectionism is not the only reason for this weakness. Over the last decade it has become clear that the recovery from the deep slump of 2008-09 was incomplete and overreliant on the build-up of corporate and consumer debt made possible by a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and central-bank money creation. But the tit-for-tat tariff wars launched by Donald Trump 18 months ago certainly haven’t helped to improve business confidence or encourage firms to invest.Mr Giscard’s original conception for the summit was that it would be an informal chat where leaders could talk privately and openly about matters of mutual concern. Given that the G7 includes the four biggest European Union economies and that the scheduled day for Brexit is little more than two months away, it might be thought that the opportunity would be taken to discuss minimising the economic damage to all concerned. That opportunity will be spurned.Finally, there’s the climate emergency. Mr Macron wants the meeting to discuss ways of protecting the Amazon rainforest – and he is right to want it on the agenda. But for meaningful action he will need buy-in from Mr Trump, and he is not going to get it from the world’s most powerful climate science denier.It wouldn’t be hard to come up with a punchier version of the pre-cooked and platitudinous communique the summiteers will put their names to. On Brexit, the G7 can’t actually do much more than provide some mood music, although some soothing noises would not go amiss. But it could certainly act elsewhere. For the economy, there could be a global growth compact that would include a commitment by Germany to run down its colossal current account surplus in return for Mr Trump abandoning protectionism. The G7 lacks the power to direct central banks to cut interest rates, but could agree to a coordinated boost to growth through fiscal policy: lower taxes and higher public spending.On climate change, G7 members would commit not just to meet the promises made at the 2015 Paris conference but to go further by pledging cash to help poorer countries make the transition to low-carbon economies. But it is naive to imagine any of this will happen. Mr Trump has made it clear that he would rather not be in Biarritz and, in truth, he would have been better off staying at home for the weekend to play golf. On the global economy and climate change he represents the problem rather than the solution, and he is not making Brexit any easier or less likely either. For the G7 to function it needs US leadership and commitment. It is getting neither."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ad51b372b68d19223ea4fb9e078297d238438a5/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab66bd09e0785bcfa742fb165977828e","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Endangered white rhinos, breeding cycads and fires in the Amazon rainforest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c04a35081c0006d75c1d84ba59b91734340e7a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cde4460a3f3a89d6e4f7626808d1b64 1900w","title":"unai emery arsenal liverpool anfield","story":"Anyone seeking to judge Arsenal on the basis of a performance at Anfield tends, these days, to come away with brow furrowed and head shaking sadly. The scene of their most famous hour has become a theatre of modern nightmares one where they are eviscerated at will and where, of 22 goals conceded there in the past six years, 15 have come before the change of ends. If Saturday’s return is to be the start of something, it would be a good idea for Unai Emery’s team to actually get started.It is a fixture Arsenal fans have become accustomed to watching through their fingers. But it is the one their manager may scour for clues more closely than any other. Emery’s opacity can be frustrating but he has never hidden the thought that Liverpool, and specifically their progression from meandering nearly-men to European champions, are an obvious benchmark for Arsenal to follow.Last December he explained he and his coaches had studied Liverpool’s rise from eighth place under Jürgen Klopp, a feat underlined within days when they overwhelmed a shambolic Arsenal in winning 5-1. If Arsenal can get significantly closer this time, Emery will see the clearest indication yet that his changes are taking hold.Those around Arsenal’s training ground sense an early-season vibrancy that had been missing in recent years a real “statement” away victory has been lacking too but Emery spoke with a relish that suggested they will carry the fight.Perhaps he feels this is a good time to play Liverpool, who join Arsenal on six points but have defended with a skittishness more reminiscent of those early Klopp years. If, as he hinted on Thursday, Emery gives Nicolas Pépé his first start then he can field a front three of pure attackers who collectively scored three more than Liverpool’s equivalent (72 to 69) in all competitions last season. Going blow for blow might yet be too risky but it is a thrilling thought and Arsenal, whose midfield has also been given added life by Dani Ceballos, sense their chance.“Right now the distance between Manchester City, Liverpool and us continues to be big but we have the opportunity on Saturday, and have the opportunity this season, to reduce that distance,” Emery said. At the same time he asked that little heed should be paid to the narrow wins over Newcastle and Burnley that have contributed to the early optimism: both fixtures, he noted, brought the same outcomes last season. But the previous time Arsenal won their opening two league games was August 2009 it is a decade since they have so much as afforded themselves the possibility to build early momentum.There are, as usual for Arsenal since the mid-2000s, warnings to take from what followed. After thrashing Everton and Portsmouth they faced back-to-back games against Manchester United and Manchester City, losing both. This year, the visit to Anfield directly precedes a north London derby. Should Arsenal emerge undefeated from those assignments there will be clear grounds to suggest Emery is equipped to narrow the gap.Emery said his players were ready to “show the difference now against Liverpool, and also away at Anfield”. He remembers specifics of the December capitulation that he believes were unusual: the “not normal” concession of two penalties that were “maybe fair … maybe not” and the two quick goals conceded through defensive mistakes after Ainsley Maitland‑Niles had opened the scoring. Eliminating errors will be the baseline if Arsenal are to have any hope of showing a fresh complexion up front.In what now seems a different universe, Emery’s Sevilla team inflicted Klopp’s first major Liverpool setback with a 3-1 win in the 2016 Europa League final. Twelve of the 18 players in Klopp’s matchday squad have since left and the idea Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah would one day be tearing defences apart in tandem would have felt fanciful. A serious run at honours took another two years and a series of major personnel changes. Emery, whose contract has a break clause next summer, is up against the clock but hopes Liverpool’s turnaround sets a precedent for expectations of his own work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6ff1058a97bbc8ba4a01f85af1ccda55ad2aef/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e595f7db8756473b19499248de9d25a5","title":"lets move to west kirby merseyside way things used to be","story":"With bowling greens and municipal parks skirting the prom, this town should be preserved in its entirety as a monument to traditional aspirationWhat’s going for it?

It contains selected diary entries that make for surprisingly glum reading. We see Swift progress from wide-eyed 13-year-old (“I heart school!”) to one of the world’s biggest stars: the latter the source of considerable woe. There are complaints about fans outside her house, worries about her relationships failing due to “the nasty world that just wants to ruin things” and about 2016, when her personal woes, including her mother’s cancer diagnosis, were compounded by public spats with other artists – most notably Kanye West – a succession of think-pieces bemoaning her awfulness and, most mind-boggling of all, her unsolicited adoption as a figurehead of the American alt-right after she declined to endorse a presidential candidate. “This summer,” she writes, from the thick of it, “is the apocalypse.”The album that resulted from said apocalypse, 2017’s Reputation, was a messy, uneven explosion of bitterness and cynicism amid the love songs, on which Swift’s desire for public redress sometimes overwhelmed her songwriting smarts: you could understand why her mouth tended to purse itself into a cat’s bum of disapproval, but by the time you got to This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things, a dressing-down of a former friend now expelled from Swift’s life of champagne-swilling luxury, it was hard not to wish she’d give it a rest. Under these circumstances, you’d be forgiven for heaving a weary sigh as Lover’s opening track I Forgot That You Existed springs into life. We seem to be back exactly where we left off: another perfidious ex-pal getting it in the neck, to the accompaniment of jaunty piano and brittle-sounding laughter.It’s a strange way to open Lover, because it’s a misnomer: if Swift can’t keep the lemon out of her gob entirely – You Need to Calm Down is a forgettable bit of how-dare-you, in which the actions of celeb-baiting internet trolls get mixed up with those of homophobes – the tone of Lover is noticeably different from its predecessor, the bitterness largely expunged in favour of besotted paeans to her British partner, actor Joe Alwyn. He gets hymned in every conceivable way, from the Mazzy Star-ish title track to London Boy, on which an artist once unironically labelled America’s Sweetheart slips charmingly into the British vernacular – it’s all “down the pub” this and “his best mate” that and “I fancy you” the other.Indeed, it’s tempting to say he’s hymned a little too much. The big problem with Lover is that it’s too long, the suspicion being that Swift is trying to reassert her commercial dominance by spread-betting. Reputation represented a relative sales wobble, shifting a mere 4.5m copies as opposed to 1989’s 10m, and she’s recently signed a new record deal, of which Lover is the first fruit. Fans who like her best in snarkily defensive mode can wallow in I Forgot That You Existed and You Need to Calm Down. Listeners who pine for the less-knowing Swift, her lyrical focus on romance, are thrown a bone in the widescreen, St Vincent-assisted synth pop of Cruel Summer, which fixes her relationship with Alwyn in terms of sneaking in through garden gates and drunk tears in the back of a car. Those who think it all went wrong when she left Nashville and fixed her sights on pop can console themselves with Soon You’ll Get Better, a gorgeous, hushed country ballad about her mother’s illness, bedecked with banjo, fiddle and backing vocals by the Dixie Chicks.Those who want her to be a straightforward mainstream pop star, meanwhile, get the single Me!, which nearly hospitalises itself trying to be a crowd-rousing anthem built in the image of The Greatest Showman soundtrack. You can understand the pragmatic impulse to cover every base, but not even Taylor Swift, usually possessed of far higher quality control than her peers, can muster enough knockout tunes to fill 18 tracks. The bravura displays of songwriting – not least The Archer, a brilliant, echo-drenched exercise in mounting tension that teases, but never reaches, an explosive climax – are padded out with pretty lightweight stuff: Death By a Thousand Cuts, by-numbers pop elevated a little by a piano part that flutters delicately in the background the new wave-y misfire Paper Rings.Meanwhile, another section of her fanbase – those who keep loudly insisting that Swift fix her lyrical gaze on bigger issues – are certainly catered for. We’re living through one of those weird moments in history when it’s deemed that pop stars need to have Something to Say About the State of Things. Perhaps noting the ensuing acres of guff suggesting most of them they haven’t got anything original or thought-provoking to say at all, Swift has thus far declined to join in, but here changes her mind. The feminist-flavoured The Man has an If I Were a Boy-esque lyrical conceit, snappy and exasperated in equal measure. Miss Americana \u0026amp the Heartbreak Prince, meanwhile, is one of the best things here, not a phrase regularly associated with pop’s attempts to get to grips with the horrors of 2019. It takes a classic Swift lyrical trope – the Springsteen-y one in which two young sweethearts vow to leave their small town – and retools it to reflect the abandon-ship despair engendered by Trump’s America. Audibly indebted to Lana Del Rey, it’s infinitely smarter and subtler than anything her peers can manage when pushing the button marked “woke”.That said, Lover’s highlights come when Swift ignores the outside world, whether that’s politics, public image or the desire to reassert her pop dominance. False God is beautiful and strangely subdued: an introverted small-hours love song on which a rambling sax solo weaves around Swift’s voice. It’s Nice to Have a Friend, meanwhile, sounds like nothing else Swift has made before, a brief sliver of a song set to samples of steel pan, tubular bells and a Canadian kids’ choir. They hint at another album, buried amid Lover’s landslide of styles and lyrical approaches, more subtle and low-key and experimental, but potentially more satisfying.As it is, Lover offers plenty of evidence that Swift is just a better songwriter than any of her competitors in the upper echelons of pop, but its something-for-everyone approach feels like consolidation, not progress, designed to keep Swift as one of the world’s biggest stars without provoking the kind of backlash that led her to start evoking the end of days in her diary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec2d6b3ad083ca41ec273914892d500aa72175d/0_616_4489_2695/master/4489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=458db8adf3fa1472d592a97c0dfd1f80","title":"weatherwatch forecasts accurate 17 days future","story":"Today, seven-day forecasts are respectably accurate, but going beyond that has proved difficultMuch as we might mock our weather forecasts, meteorologists are now pretty darn accurate. Today’s three-day weather forecasts are on average more reliable than a one-day forecast was in the 1980s, and even a seven-day forecast is respectable. So will we be tuning in to the 17-day forecast by 2050?To try to answer this question, Falko Judt, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, used a supercomputer to run two nearly identical weather simulation models over a 20-day period. The first began with the actual weather observations from 19 October 2012 the second model tweaked the starting conditions by a tiny fraction – about one-thousandth of a degree.The findings, which were published in the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, found that the two simulations produced very similar forecasts for the first six days, but thereafter they began to erge until after 17 days they had nothing in common. Multiple small scale events, such as thunderstorms, drove regional atmospheric patterns off in random directions after a week or so. This suggests that with perfect weather observations forecasters can produce near-perfect six- to seven-day forecasts, but forecasting accurately beyond this isn’t likely to be realistic any time soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6337c103d30420317a9943ca7d8c38e80e9f89/464_0_4776_2867/master/4776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d525df878f17d121f8e90492ee43c7c","title":"the best beaches in nice and cote dazur france","story":"From the palm-fringed beaches of Cannes, to the chilled vibe of Plage de la Salis, the Côte d’Azur has beaches to suit every tastePlage de la Bocca, CannesAway from Cannes’ many private beaches is the sandy stretch of Plage de la Bocca, west of the city.

He will also underline his commitment to maintaining the UK’s stringent animal welfare standards.The US president has repeatedly praised Johnson, calling him “Britain Trump”, and stressing their “very good relationship”.Downing Street is keen to capitalise on the rapport between the pair, as the UK prepares to leave the vast trading bloc of the EU. Johnson is wary thoughof being seen as Trump’s poodle, the derisive term often used to describe Tony Blair’s relationship with George W Bush during the Iraq war.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused Johnson on Friday of pursuing a “Trump first” foreign policy.“The UK should use its position in the G7, on the UN security council and the international financial institutions to promote policies to tackle the climate emergency and that are proven to reduce inequality and improve lives around the world, including universal healthcare, education and social security,” Corbyn said.“Instead, this weekend we’ll see the ugly spectacle of our prime minister pursuing his Trump-first policy, putting us at the mercy of a US administration that threatens peace, prosperity and the future of our planet.”Downing Street is not expecting a specific timetable for trade talks to emerge from the weekend’s discussions. Both sides are conscious of the challenging questions involved, including on animal welfare standards and the NHS. A government spokesperson said: “Of course we want to move quickly, but we want to get the right deal that works for both sides.”Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, has suggested a series of “fast track” deals could be signed covering specific sectors – perhaps within months of Brexit day. London, however, intends to continue pursuing a broader agreement, which is likely to take longer to conclude.The thorniest issue under discussion is likely to be Iran. Johnson is not expected to signal any shift in position away from staunch support for the multilateral nuclear deal rejected by Trump. He hopes to stress the shared aims of both the US and Europe in restraining Tehran, despite bitter disagreement in recent months about how to approach the issue.Johnson also appeared to take aim at Trump’s tit-for-tat economic battle with China in his pre-summit statement, pointing to the damage wrought by new barriers to trade. “International tensions and new trade barriers are threatening global growth,” he said, before listing a string of other issues on the agenda in France.“Violence and conflict are trapping countries in poverty, depriving children, and particularly girls, of the universal right to education. Climate change is accelerating the devastating and unprecedented loss of habitats and species.”France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has scrapped the idea of an overarching G7 communique, hoping to skirt lengthy wrangles over issues such as the climate crisis, where the Trump White House stands apart. Aseries of separate agreements are expected to be published instead.As well as meeting Trump, and the Canadian, Japanese and Italian leaders, Johnson will also hold his first face-to-face discussions with the European council president, Donald Tusk, as the government races to meet what the prime minister has called the “blistering” timetable for reworking the Brexit deal.The lead on Brexit is taken not by the European council, but the European commission, whose president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will not be in Biarritz because he is recovering from an operation.With Labour threatening to table a vote of no confidence when parliament returns from its summer recess next month in an effort to avert a no-deal Brexit, Johnson is keen to demonstrate his determination to negotiate a deal.He has seized on the German chancellor Angela Merkel’s mention of seeking a solution within 30 days, though both she and Macron both restated their determination that the Irish backstop must remain in place. Johnson will again reiterate his government’s determination to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

As with so much else, Joe Cokanasiga stands out from the crowd.Four years ago, on the night of the first match of the 2015 World Cup between England and Fiji, Cokanasiga was part of the pre-match entertainment outside Twickenham. The then 17-year-old was performing a traditional war dance outside the gates on behalf of the Fijian embassy, dreaming of one day appearing at the World Cup but considering it “impossible”. Four years on and there is every chance Cokanasiga will be the breakout star of the 2019 World Cup in Japan.“I was actually at Fiji v England on the opening night and we were showcasing our country before the game started,” Cokanasiga said. “I remember the vibe that night, and the whole vibe around the World Cup and thinking that I wanted to do all this one day. But it didn’t feel possible. I am now and that feels a bit weird.”Such is the hype that surrounds Cokanasiga it is easy to forget he has made only six Test appearances. Eddie Jones has done all he can to temper expectations, even leaving him out of the squad altogether against Scotland having burst on to the Six Nations stage a week earlier with a stunning performance against Italy, but the head coach does admit that Cokanasiga can be “absolutely devastating” even if he has been able to show it only in glimpses so far in the warm-up series.He scored his third Test try against Wales at Twickenham two weeks ago but last Saturday in Cardiff was a source of frustration for Cokanasiga. It was a turgid contest with space at a premium and Cokanasiga spent most of the afternoon being targeted by Dan Biggar’s boot. Against Ireland on Saturday, however, Cokanasiga is hopeful of more opportunities to showcase his strengths, as part of what Ben Youngs believes is England’s most threatening back line.“I feel like I have a lot more in me,” Cokanasiga said. “That has been the most frustrating thing for me – that I have more to show. Getting my hands on the ball more, for example, and that comes from my work-rate and how hungry I am.”“He is one of those kids who comes into Test rugby and first couple of games, he is magic. Someone has blown some dust on him. That is the big difference between Test and domestic rugby. When people see a weakness, they go at you and keep going at you. Then the development of the player is, right, how do I fix this? And how do I get around it? Joe is going through that process at the moment. So it’s good for him.”England’s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, has already played a key role in Cokanasiga’s development. The Australian is often seen conducting one-on-one training sessions with the 21-year-old and is only too aware his work is far from done. “He is a massive threat,” Wisemantel said. “You look at him physically and he is imposing. We have to remember he is only six Tests in so it is a small window and we have to keep developing Joe. Most other coaches know who he is so that is what you are dealing with. Like any player, any team, the other coaches do their homework, so they will know who he is.”Wisemantel was also no doubt responsible for deploying Cokanasiga at the back of the England scrum against Italy. For he is a constant source of left-field suggestions, the latest of which is a 13-man lineout which may or may not be unveiled against Ireland. “I come up with some insane ideas,” Wisemantel said. “I think you do have to throw the ideas up there, have a look and, between the coaches and some of the senior players, refine it and work on it. We work out on the pitch whether it’s got merit or not and then make a quick decision. You can’t dwell on things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a17e199ba97e980ee1ac0a8762b9a4ee72f94a3/1219_196_2741_1645/master/2741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=570793b7eeecafa07a816b8ce204cbce","title":"naomi osaka us open expectations tennis","story":"Naomi Osaka arrived at last year’s US Open a dangerous floater buoyed by a season of promise and left it as one of the world’s most visible sportspeople after winning her maiden grand slam title in one of the most controversial finals in the tournament’s centuries-ning history.One year on the world No 1 returns to the scene of her signature triumph beset by injury and weighed down by an entirely new set of expectations but no less empowered by the quiet confidence that has lifted her to the summit of women’s tennis.The 21-year-old enters among the shortlist of betting favourites as the defending champion and top seed in the women’s draw at the tournament, which kicks off here on Monday morning.But since backing up last year’s breakthrough run at Flushing Meadows compellingly with an Australian Open title in January that lifted her to the top of the WTA rankings, Osaka has weathered an extended rocky patch including early exits at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, followed by a knee injury that cut short a crucial runway event in the Cincinnati quarter-finals.“It’s definitely changed for me,” Osaka said on Friday of her whirlwind 50-week journey since last year’s US Open. “I took a break and relaxed my mind and realised that you have to have fun doing what you love. I love tennis. Sometimes I feel like I don’t but I wake up every morning and, if I don’t play, I feel like I kind of have done nothing during the day. I just go out now every day trying to learn something new, trying to just do the best that I can.”The cool-tempered star held court on a rainy afternoon at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center when it was confirmed that Carlos Ramos, the umpire whose conflict with Serena Williams during last year’s women’s final came to overshadow Osaka’s milestone victory, will not take charge of any matches involving the Williams sisters over the next fortnight.So often has Osaka been prodded for her impressions from that regrettable episode that she politely declined to address further questions about it, rather insisting her experience as a reigning champion at Indian Wells this year offered valuable preparation for the media crucible New York presents.“I think going to Indian Wells and learning how defending champion pressure feels, I think it definitely helped me out going into this tournament,” she said. “Because I just feel more loose and comfortable here. I’m not sure if it’s because the last couple of months have been turbulent but I feel really comfortable and I know that, despite everything, I play well here every year. I’m not too worried about that.”The cerebral Osaka, who ceded the No 1 ranking to Australia’s Ashleigh Barty for seven weeks this summer before regaining it this month, took a typically philosophical tack when asked to reflect on a sometimes challenging year at the top of the sport – where the pressures of global stardom and a rapidly expanding sponsorship portfolio can often trump the benefits.“It has its moments,” she said. “There are some times I definitely think to myself I’m really blessed to be in this position and then there is bad things that come with that.“I would never say anything negative about what’s going on in my life right now, because for me that’s my life. That’s what I kind of have to deal with every day. I don’t know. For me, when you say is it a dream, it’s like something fluffy, like you’re on the beach somewhere sipping a pina colada. I’m right here right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e91af8238e2be9ee4d1b7d3d87e09f11441cbed/0_425_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f6e056947fb09697379707066a48ee5","title":"amazon products removed toxic wsj","story":"Wall Street Journal found that more than 4,000 items for sale on Amazon have been declared unsafe by federal agenciesAmazon has removed hundreds of toxic and unsafe products from its site after a Wall Street Journal report found thousands of listings from third-party sellers don’t comply with federal safety standards. Thousands of problematic products remain.More than 4,000 items for sale on Amazon have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, including 2,000 listings for children’s toys and medications. The Journal also identified 157 items Amazon had already banned still listed on the site, and one product it tested had lead levels that exceed federal limits.“In practice, Amazon has increasingly evolved like a flea market,” the Journal’s report said. “It exercises limited oversight over items listed by millions of third-party sellers, many of them anonymous, many in China, some offering scant information.”The laws surrounding Amazon’s responsibility for third party products are complex. In June 2018, a judge ruled Amazon was not liable for damages after a family’s house burned down in a fire started by a hoverboard purchased on the marketplace, and in 2016, Amazon won a case brought by a customer whose LG cell phone battery exploded in his pocket.Amazon’s liability for third-party sellers is changing, however. In July, a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Amazon may be liable for the damage caused by one of its products, after a woman was permanently blinded in one eye due to a malfunctioning dog leash purchased on the site.It said Amazon may qualify as more than just a publisher under Section 230 because its role as a sales platform “extends beyond a mere editorial function”. Amazon determines which sellers are allowed on the site and has the ability to remove posts, meaning it is “fully capable, in its sole discretion, of removing unsafe products from its website”, the Philadelphia court said.The WSJ report told of a Missouri customer who bought a faulty motorcycle helmet from Amazon and died when it malfunctioned. The helmet remained listed on the website despite not being compliant with US Department of Transportation regulations. Amazon took the listing down following WSJ reports. Another product, yellow maracas meant for children, contained 411 times legally allowed levels of lead, according to the report.In a blogpost responding to the Journal report, Amazon said it has developed tools to prevent suspicious and unsafe products from being listed in the store. “We invest significant resources to protect our customers and have built robust programs designed to ensure products offered for sale in our store are safe and compliant,” Amazon said in the statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2591cf99a7eee0ca05f6729ed1bf3378a53607/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40379b5bfa76ff7418cc784274e4b143","title":"cambridge analytica facebook response internal document","story":"Internal correspondence provides new insight into how Facebook staff reacted to concerns about use of user data by political campaign consultantsInternal Facebook correspondence from September 2015, released as part of a US government lawsuit on Friday, reveals new details about Facebook’s early knowledge of potentially improper data collection by Cambridge Analytica.The existence of the internal discussion was first reported by the  in March 2019. That report marked Facebook’s first acknowledgement that some of its employees were aware of concerns about improper data practices by Cambridge Analytica four months before the ’s 11 December 2015 article exposed them. Facebook’s lack of candor about this earlier knowledge to both investors and the press was one of the subjects of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint that Facebook settled by paying a $100m fine in July. Facebook did not admit or deny the SEC’s allegations as part of its settlement.But the correspondence – which the Washington DC attorney general’s office fought for months to unseal as part of its lawsuit – provides new insight into how Facebook staff reacted, or did not react, to concerns about the use of user data by political campaign consultants.The Observer’s March 2018 report on Cambridge Analytica’s continued use of the data and links to Donald Trump’s campaign erupted into an international scandal, inspiring global outrage over the company’s failure to protect users’ personal data and wiping $134bn off Facebook’s market value as its stock price plunged.The correspondence was initiated on 22 September 2015, when a Facebook staff member requested clarification on Facebook’s policies for political consultancies that were scraping data to match Facebook profiles to the lists of voters that campaigns use, known as voter files. (The names of Facebook employees are redacted.)“We suspect many of these companies are doing similar types of scraping, the largest and most aggressive on the conservative side being Cambridge Analytica … a sketchy (to say the least) data modeling company that has penetrated our market deeply.”The employee requested clarity on Facebook’s policies and an investigation into “what Cambridge specifically is actually doing”, as well as further information about the activities of another political consultancy, NationBuilder.No one appears to have responded for a week, and on 29 September another message was sent reiterating that political clients were submitting “pointed questions … around what is in bounds versus what is out of bounds”. “Many companies seem to be in on the edge – possibly over,” the staffer wrote.This second message prompted a handful of responses with differing opinions on the legitimacy of the data practices. One respondent said the request was being passed to “DevOps for initial review”. Another respondent said that their “hunch” is that the data-scraping was “likely non-compliant” with a number of Facebook’s Platform Policies, but noted that it was difficult to decide without more information about how Cambridge Analytica was tapping into Facebook’s system.One staffer appeared intent on tamping down on expectations that Facebook would expend “resources” to proactively investigate the apps that were extracting data from its users, however.“To set expectations, we can’t certifyapprove apps for compliance, and it’s very likely these companies are not in violation of any of our terms,” the employee wrote. “If we had more resources we could discuss a call with the companies to get a better understanding, but we should only explore that path if we do see red flags.”Facebook had a headcount of 11,996 employees and $15.8bn in cash or cash equivalents as of 30 September 2015, according to financial filings.Discussion on the thread lagged after that message and focused on other political consultancies until 11 December 2015, when the  published its expose.“Can you expedite the review of Cambridge Analytica or let us know what the next steps are?” an employee wrote on the thread that morning. “Unfortunately, this firm is now a PR issue as this story is on the front page of the  website.”Over the course of the rest of the day, discussion focused on understanding the relationship between GSR, a company formed by Aleksandr Kogan, a former Cambridge University academic, which extracted the data of tens of millions of Facebook users, and Cambridge Analytica, which obtained the data from Kogan and GSR for use in political campaigning.The discussion also revealed a number of additional links between Facebook employees and the academics responsible for the research underpinning Cambridge Analytica’s psychometric targeting.One said that they were “good friends” with Michal Kosinski, an erstwhile colleague of Kogan’s at Cambridge. Kosinski had helped pioneer the use of Facebook data to predict personality traits.“Alex Kogan was my postdoc supervisor at Cambridge, although I left before he founded GSR,” a second employee wrote. “I have a cursory understanding on the basic principles behind GSR’s products and data collection methods, if that helps. Feel free to ask me anything.”(Another of Kogan’s Cambridge postdoc students, Joseph Chancellor, had been hired by Facebook in November 2015, but he does not appear to be referenced in the thread. Chancellor co-founded GSR with Kogan and, according to Kogan, was an equal partner in the enterprise.)A third person pointed out a direct relationship between Facebook and Kogan, writing: “It sounds like Facebook has worked with this ‘Aleksandr Kogan’ on research with the Protect \u0026amp Care team.”  reported on Kogan’s research collaborations with Facebook in 2018.On Friday, Facebook published a blogpost by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, entitled “Document holds the potential for confusion”. The post downplays the importance of the document.“There is no substantively new information in this document and the issues have been previously reported,” Grewal wrote. “In September 2015, a Facebook employee shared unsubstantiated rumors from a competitor of Cambridge Analytica, which claimed that the data analytics company was scraping public data ... An engineer looked into this concern and was not able to find evidence of data scraping. Even if such a report had been confirmed, such incidents would not naturally indicate the scale of the misconduct that Kogan had engaged in.“Cambridge Analytica was a clear lapse for us, which we have worked hard to address. We’ve learned many lessons that will help us become a stronger company going forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end.

It was a maternity home during the 1960s and 1970s, and many locals were born there (including me). The house was bequeathed to the people of Dumbarton, but for many years lay in a sad state of disrepair until it was let to a Christian organisation. It runs a tea room on Saturdays (and Thursdays and Fridays in summer).

Sited on a former second world war airfield, it has a number of trails through the woods, as well as smooth track perfect for cycling or skating. It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas. Given that is was once the burial ground for thousands of animals caught up in the foot-and-mouth crisis, its transformation into to a nature reserve, wind farm and disability cycling charity is a serene triumph.• watchtreeJames CartwrightHengistbury Head, just south of Christchurch, is a beautiful, tranquil and constantly changing piece of coastline that has something for everyone.

Or we can choose to go high on to the head and walk the path through heather and ferns, with views of Christchurch Priory and estuary on one side, and the Dorset coastline on the other. Then, right at the tip, you see Mudeford Spit and its beach huts.

The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step.

Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire.

It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds.

More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year.

The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons.

These are just some of the adjectives beachgoers in Santa Severa, a town near Rome, used to describe the motley crew of politicians at the centre of Italy’s latest political drama.“I’m bewildered,” said Mirella Castracane-Mombelli as she read a newspaper at a beach bar on Friday morning.“This situation shows that our political institutions are inadequate and do not represent us. They are all just opportunistic. Sergio Mattarella is the only one with a sense of duty and correctness, the only one.”President Mattarella’s speech to the nation on Thursday night was brief but clear: either Italy’s main political parties come up with a strong new government by Tuesday, or he will call fresh elections.Italy plunged into turmoil on Tuesday when the outgoing prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, ended the ill-fated alliance between the far-right League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S). The collapse was triggered earlier this month by the League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, as he sought to cash in on his high popularity and bring about snap elections.Salvini immediately started campaigning on the beaches of Italy’s south, an M5S stronghold, urging supporters to give the League the opportunity to “save Italy”.But after two weeks of game-playing, betrayal and manipulation among their leaders, Italians at the beach at Santa Severa, regardless of their political allegiance, only foresaw destruction.“They are irresponsible, immature and incapable,” said Francesco Sciarra. “We don’t have professional politicians any more, just those who improvise and insult us. Salvini can’t go ranting to the EU, creating enemies everywhere. They don’t realise the impact all this will have – Italy will end up like Greece.”Sciarra’s friend, Orlando Liparelli, agreed: “Salvini has only concentrated on immigration, whereas the focus should be on creating jobs – this is what we need to move the country forward.” Liparelli despairs at the possibility of the League and M5S patching things up and resuming government. “They have already made such a mess,” he added.Recognising the threat of the two parties derailing his plans, Salvini has made overtures to M5S, and said on Thursday that he was available to restore the partnership so long as it got things done.Meanwhile, negotiations between M5S and PD have been fractious, with the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, laying down some tough conditions for a deal, including M5S scrapping the draconian anti-immigration bill that it passed with the League, and being committed to remaining in the EU. He also objects to Conte leading their possible alternative government. His M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, said on Thursday that his party was striving for a solid majority, but he did not stipulate with whom. The two parties are meeting again on Friday afternoon but Zingaretti has said that unless a “turning point” government can be formed, then the PD is ready for elections.“With all these coalitions, it’s like asking a cat and dog to get on well together,” said a female beachgoer, who asked not to be named. “Red, green, yellow, blue … whatever the colour, they bring nothing to the people. They only think of their parliamentary seats and salaries.”And on the prospect of new elections?“We feel demoralised. Many people won’t vote,” said Daniele Capoccia. Sciarra said: “I don’t know who to vote for any more.”Salvini may have lost some consensus in recent weeks, but his party will still most probably emerge as the winner in the event of early elections, which might be held in October or November. He could then partner with Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist lineage that has grown slightly in the polls since May, and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia in order to make up a majority.“I can’t stomach Salvini. He is vulgar,” said Castracane-Mombelli. “Many Italians like him as he is authoritative, but in that respect we need to pay attention to history and try to get out of this situation.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995638.1566592368!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of children with autism special needs without appropriate school places","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh: ‘I am deeply conscious of the stress and anxiety facing parents and their children as we work to secure more places. It is a priority issue for the department.’ Photograph: Alan Betson Hundreds of children with autism or special needs are without appropriate school places ahead of the start of the new school year, new figures indicate.A total of 384 children are in receipt of home tuition grants, which are provided to children on an interim basis on a number of grounds, including the absence of a place in a recognised school, according to latest Department of Education figures.In addition, special needs campaigners and parents say many more children with complex problems are in inappropriate school placements or pre-school settings that do not meet their assessed needs.This, they say, is due to a shortage of places in special schools, which means many end up in special classes attached to mainstream schools lacking specialised supports.The department said it had invested record sums in special education and the number of special classes in schools had jumped from 548 to 1,459 since 2011. In the Dublin 15 area, where shortages of school places are most acute, the department has issued “statutory notices” which legally oblige six schools to make more school places available.‘Stress and anxiety’“I am deeply conscious of the stress and anxiety facing parents and their children as we work to secure more places. It is a priority issue for the department,” Minister for Education Joe McHugh said.In a statement, the National Council for Special Education – which advises the department – said it was aware only a “small number” of children with special needs in the greater Dublin area were still without school places.However, many campaigners say the scale of shortages is far bigger than is officially acknowledged and that there is a lack of data being gathered on the ground.A parents survey carried out by the autism charity AsIAm earlier this year found more than 300 cases of children who were either without a school place or not attending school regularly.Adam Harris, the charity’s chief executive, said the department’s response at the time was that they were satisfied that sufficient school places existed.‘Crisis’“As we enter a new academic year and there are still a plethora of children unable to attend school, the department and the Minister must take responsibility and address this crisis in a meaningful way,” he said.“It is essential we bear in mind that these children do not simply need school places but ‘suitable’ school places as outlined in psychological assessments and in line with the views and experiences of their parents. This means where an autism class or special school is recommended the department must put this in place – otherwise we will simply see these children fall out of school.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995459.1566580147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government may have to provide 17m deal for fair deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFair Deal: Jim Daly, Minister of State with responsibilty for older people, has told the Department of Health extra funding needs to come from the Department of Public Expenditure in order to ensure the four-week wait-time target is met.The Government may have to provide a €17 million bailout for Fair Deal to avert growing delays in accessing the scheme for funding nursing home places.Waiting times for entry to the scheme have risen to an average six or seven weeks, the HSE said yesterday, well above the normal four weeks. However, delays of up to six months have been reported by nursing home owners, who say many older people are languishing at home or in hospital while their applications are processed.A Nursing Homes Ireland survey yesterday reported delays of six months for patients seeking Fair Deal funding in Co Galway, four months in Co Mayo and three months in Co Kilkenny.The HSE said it operates a single national waiting list and insisted there were no variances nationally.In order to prevent waiting times spiralling further, the Minister of State with responsibilty for older people, Jim Daly, has told officials in the Department of Health that extra funding needs to come from the Department of Public Expenditure in order to ensure the four-week wait-time target is met.Original estimateIn a letter obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Mr Daly acknowledged efficiencies secured by health officials had reduced the additional funding required from an original estimate of €30 million. He suggested about €17 million would be needed.The financial problems at Fair Deal come as official correspondence reveals home support services – another main plank in the Government’s policy for older people – is also running out of money.HSE chief executive Paul Reid has told his board in a confidential memo it did not have sufficient money to keep up with demand and there were now more than 6,000 people waiting for funding for home-support services. The State currently pays nearly €450 million to provide home supports such as home helps to about 53,000 people.Mr Daly has said the Government was “actively considering” the introduction of a co-payment system to facilitate an expansion of services. This could see a means test being put in place such as applies for the Fair Deal scheme and some people having to pay towards the cost.Mr Daly wrote to his officials in mid-July, saying more money was needed from the exchequer to allow Fair Deal to continue to operate in line with Government policy.He expressed frustration at “protracted ongoing communications “ between the Department of Health and the HSE over funding for Fair Deal for the remainder of the year.‘Concerned’“I remain concerned, however, that the estimated number of leavers from the scheme is significantly off forecast, and it appears clear to me that additional funding needed to be requested from the Department of Public Expenditure to ensure that the HSE can continue to fulfil the commitments made in the Programme for Government.”The Fair Deal scheme will this year receive just under €1 billion from the exchequer to provide nursing-home care for about 23,000 people.However from the start there were concerns within the HSE that more money would be needed. The current financial problems also stem from the number of people leaving the scheme this year – either voluntarily or as a result of their death – being fewer than anticipated.Fair Deal, also known as the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, has a budget allocation of €999 million for 2019 and supports about 23,000 people at any one time."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Caseload has decreased every year since the controversial court was establishedJust 127 children have attended urgent care facility since opening in JulyCountess of Dunraven donates plaster mask for display in Derrynane House museumHSE says delays for entry to the scheme have risen to an average of six or seven weeksTotal of 384 children are in receipt of home tuition grants, latest figures showCameroonian singer who arrived here in 2013 says music helped her through bad timesBritish owners of Donegal Animal Hospital cite shortage of vets and other \u0026lsquolegal\u0026rsquo issuesAlternative proposals backer urges Dublin to talk to London about no-dealTaoiseach threatens to vote against deal backed by Hogan over rainforest wildfiresCompassionate release refused to Clifford McKeown for Malcolm McKeown\u0026rsquos serviceUnion says antisocial behaviour and thuggery on public transport is on the riseAccident occurred at Blackrock beach on Friday afternoonShop owner Ken O\u0026rsquoConnor has previously sold a winning ticket for a \u0026euro6m jackpotCity police identify deceased as Ciar\u0026aacuten O\u0026rsquoBoyle who was staying in BrooklynSalthill venue hosted countless high-profile music acts in recent decadesApplications for the post from outside the Garda will be consideredChief medical officer warned advocate of \u0026lsquovery strong response\u0026rsquo to repeated commentsUS attorney alleges priest used stolen funds to buy a beach house, travel and diningHigh Court judge rules Charleton was not biased by previous interaction with witness"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995625.1566590514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government must open up to plan b to backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder fears: “It would be a lot better to have an actual proper conversation now rather than wait until the 11th hour when we are in the worst possible situation.”  Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Government needs to open up and discuss a plan B to the Brexit backstop, according to the chair of the technical group behind proposed alternative arrangements embraced by new British prime minister Boris Johnson. Shanker Singham, an adviser on trade who chairs the technical panel of the non-governmental Alternative Arrangements Commission, said he did not think it “wise” for Dublin not to discuss a possible no-deal exit with London given the heightened risk that this scenario could happen by the next Brexit deadline of October 31st. He said that it was essential for the Irish, British and French customs authorities to have “critical conversations” to avoid the disruption of a no-deal “that are not happening now.” Tánaiste Simon Coveney this week ruled out direct discussions with the UK around preparing for a no-deal. “The best approach from the Irish Government would be to open up and at least have a discussion about these things,” Mr Singham told The , referring to the alternative to the backstop his group had proposed, which includes a proposal to create a new common food safety zone covering Ireland and the UK.‘Proper conversation’“We may be at a point late in October where we have to have discussions. It would be a lot better to have an actual proper conversation now rather than wait until the 11th hour when we are in the worst possible situation.”In meetings with the French and German leaders this week, Mr Johnson referred to the alternative arrangements proposed last month by the group led by former Conservative minister Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, now UK culture secretary, that would avoid the UK entering the backstop.The backstop is the insurance plan within the proposed withdrawal agreement covering the UK’s exit from the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the absence of another solution being found in future. The House of Commons has rejected the withdrawal agreement three times amid fears the backstop could tie the UK to EU economic rules indefinitely. Mr Johnson has demanded that the backstop be scrapped. Backstop supersededTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he would listen to Mr Johnson’s alternative proposals and if he can convince the EU and Ireland, which has ruled out reopening the Brexit agreement, that they could supersede the backstop. Mr Singham said his group had been in discussions with Downing Street about its alternative arrangements.The commission would be publishing suggested changes to the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, the non-binding road map setting out a future EU-UK trade deal, “in the course of the next week or so” that would add more detail to its proposed arrangements around the alternative to the backstop, he said.Mr Singham said he could “sympathise” with Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney if the choice around the UK’s exit was either the alternative arrangements or the backstop, but he added that “the game has changed completely in Westminster” with the election of Mr Johnson as prime minister. “We are now in a world where the choice is alternative arrangements versus no-deal, not alternative arrangements versus backstop. In that world I think you would want to be talking,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsPossibly the first description that would come to mind when describing John Deasy – who announced on Friday he would stepping down as a TD at the next general election – is contrarian.While there is ample evidence over his 17-year career in national politics to back up that reputation of an outspoken maverick – including long-running disputes with his former leader Enda Kenny and with Fine Gael Waterford constituency rival Paudie Coffey – there were many other aspects to his political make-up.Schooled in US politics during his 20s, when he worked for a Republican member of Congress, Deasy brought a direct and sometimes abrasive style to Dáil Éireann, as well as an unrelenting focus on the issues he was most passionate about.He single-handedly initiated a campaign to ban handguns in Ireland which culminated in his private members’s Bill being enacted by a Fianna Fáil government in 2008.\u0026nbspHe was also a particularly effective member of the Public Accounts Committee with a capacity to cut through the waffle to get to the core issues. He was an early champion, for example, of Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe.But that sometimes backfired on Deasy. He was promoted to the key post of justice spokesman by then Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny when first elected to the Dáil in 2002.Smoking in the DáilDeasy strongly opposed the smoking ban and caused a media firestorm in 2004 when he lit up in the Dáil bar and refused to stop smoking. That act of bravado and recklessness led to Kenny firing him from the party front bench. It also led to an animus between both politicians that did not subside.Deasy (52) is the son of Austin Deasy, a former minister and TD, who was also a thorn in the side of several Fine Gael leaders.From Dungarvan, Deasy jnr was a scratch golfer in his teens and went to university in the US on a golf scholarship.After qualifying, he worked on Capitol Hill for almost a decade, where he forged high-level contacts, particularly in the Republican Party. He returned to Ireland when his father retired and was elected to the Dáil in 2002. He is married to the television presenter Máire Dirrane. They have one son, Cal.Deasy has retained his seat all three general elections since he was first elected. However, a long-running internal rift within Fine Gael in the constituency has continued during his time, personified in his continuous public disputes with Senator Paudie Coffey.The latest iteration of it was when the faction in Waterford to which Coffey is affiliated voted a motion of no confidence in Deasy earlier this year.“It is a constant factor in Waterford internal politics. It has helped me electorally in that it has galvanised my support base and reinforced my vote constantly,” Deasy told The  on Friday.Deasy said the handgun legislation was one of his proudest legacies. It was difficult to steer it through the Oireachtas and there were the after-effects – he received hate mail for five years after.His differences with Kenny dominated that period of his career. He called for a new leader after the general election in 2007 and suggested he himself would be willing to stand. When Kenny faced a leadership challenge in 2010, Deasy was one of the leading figures supporting Richard Bruton.Backbench exileWhen Kenny emerged as the victor, some of the key people involved in the heave found themselves being exiled to the back benches, including Brian Hayes, Michael Creed and Charlie Flanagan. But over subsequent years, all of them came back in from the cold.The exception was Deasy. The die was cast. There was an effort at a rapprochement when Kenny offered him the chair of the Housing Committee. Deasy rejected the offer.He made his mark primarily on the Public Account Committee which was suited to his style.When Kenny stepped down, he was an early backer of Leo Varadkar. However, he had never held a ministerial portfolio. Varadkar had also promised most outgoing ministers they would be retained.The upshot was that Deasy was not offered a senior or junior ministerial position. While there were reports that he was inconsolable, Deasy himself has said that what was offered to him was exactly suitable for him.He was appointed as a special Government envoy to the US with a free hand to represent Irish interests in his old stomping ground of Capitol Hill, with a specific mandate to lobby for access to E3 visas for Irish emigrants living illegally in the US.“It has been very interesting. It connected me back with my background and I was able to renew my contacts,” he said.Deasy argues that having an elected representative doing the Government’s bidding on Capitol Hill has given more traction.There has been some progress but the Bill has been stalled because of the opposition of one senator – Tom Cotton of Arkansas.Deasy remains confident it will pass both houses of government there.He has said he made up his mind a long time ago to leave politics and informed Varadkar in March. He had not made his mind up yet on his future but has said he has had a few offers, and could be US-based for some of the time.Asked would he miss politics, he said: “If I had left 10 years ago I would have missed it. I won’t miss it now. It has become a very strange animal. It has become chronically uncertain for people who have become elected.“If somebody has a stable job with a young family I would not recommend it. The instability will continue after the next election as politics continues to fracture and people’s lives will be put on hold for years.”Those comments typify his style – which is to call it as he sees it, regardless of if it rubs people up the wrong way."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995531.1566584683!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"macron outlines plan to rediscover g7 s life force","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t French president Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech on environment and social equality to business leaders in Paris, on the eve of the G7 summit. Photograph: Michel SpinglerEPAFrench president Emmanuel Macron wants the three-day G7 summit that he will host in Biarritz from Saturday to “lay the foundations of a new democratic and economic order”.The G7 comprise Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US.It is essential, Macron says, that world leaders address popular fears regarding technology, climate change and ineffectual government.The French president acknowledges that a single summit cannot reinvent the world, but he wants to “refind” what he calls the “life force” of the annual meetings established by then president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing to address the 1970s energy crisis.Macron outlined his vision of the world and the G7’s capacity to change it in a 2½-hour meeting with journalists this week.He said the world is going through “a very profound crisis of democracies” sparked by the above-mentioned fears, combined with inequalities and a crisis of capitalism, in which workers can no longer earn a decent living.These crises have fostered “illiberal democacies” and “a fascination for authoritarian regimes”, including in Europe. Illiberal democrats choose isolationism and “brutality, whether it be military, geopolitical or in trade”, Macron said.The post second World War multilateral system was threatened, “sometimes by guarantors of international order. This is part of US strategy,” Macron said.Western powers ruled the world since the 18th century: first France, then Britain, and finally the US. “This western hegemony has been compromised, sometimes by westerners themselves, their errors . . . their incapacity to reform capitalism and the emergence of new powers,” Macron said.Macron called on France and European powers “to defend and reinvent contemporary multilateralism, not to give in to the savageness of the contemporary world . . . This is what I would like to reinscribe at the heart of the G7.”Like Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s, Macron envisages a unique role for France. “We can have friends and allies, but that doesn’t mean our friends’ enemies are our enemies . . . This makes of us a power of mediation. In a world where the greatest risk is a new, bipolar conflict between the US and China, where the centre of gravity has shifted towards Asia, the risk for Europe is effacement . . . If Europe is weak and ided, it will have to choose between the US and China.”Macron called the G7 “a working laboratory” in the quest for a new humanism “where man is at the heart of the project, where technology and scientific progress are always at the service of man”.Breaking with tradition, the summit will produce no pre-negotiated final statement. “Nobody reads communiques,” Macron said, provoking laughter. “Leaders spent all night agreeing on” a communique at the last G7 summit, in Quebec in June 2018, “one minute after the press conference, it was disavowed by the US president.”Macron’s wish to transform the international order is likely to be overtaken by reality. His clash with the far-right president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, is a case in point.Macron wants the fires ravaging the Amazon rainforest to figure on the G7 agenda. Bolsonaro accused him of neo-colonialism. A two-day Twitter battle culminated on Friday with Macron calling Bolsonaro a liar and announcing that France would oppose the Mercosur trade agreement, which the EU signed in June, after 20 years of negotiations with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.Security is a concern. France has deployed 13,200 policemen to ensure that anti-capitalists, ecologists, gilets jaunes and other protesters encamped across the Spanish border do not disrupt proceedings.Macron will open the summit at 11am on Saturday. He will hold a head-to-head with German chancellor Angela Merkel after lunch, followed by a broader meeting of European members of the G7, including British prime minister Boris Johnson. Brexit is certain to come up.International economySunday morning will be devoted to security and the international economy. Macron said crises with Iran, Libya, Russia, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen would be discussed.Threats of a global recession provoked by a trade war between the US and China will be paramount in the economic discussion. Christine Lagarde, the outgoing head of the International Monetary Fund who has been appointed to head the European Central Bank, said this summer that higher tariffs between the US and China could decrease global GDP by half a percentage point next year.“The US cannot make trade wars on everyone,” Macron said. “A clarification with China is in all our interest.”If leaders want to stimulate long-term economic growth, Macron said, “We must reinvest in innovation, education and health. That will foster wellbeing, create jobs and growth potential . . . If we want our capitalism to be sustainable, it must be just.”In an issue of particular concern to Ireland, Macron singled out non-payment of tax by internet giants as uniquely unfair. He and Donald Trump have exchanged barbs via Twitter regarding the new French law which will impose a 3 per cent tax on internet companies with substantial sales in France.The US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin signed up to a G7 finance ministers’ agreement last month to “tax digital activity creating value with or without a physical presence in the country concerned”. If G7 leaders agree on the text at Biarritz, it would open the way to a global accord at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Some doubt Trump will accept it.The G7 will shift into multilateral mode from lunchtime on Sunday. Macron will welcome the heads of the IMF, OECD, World Bank, International Labour Organisation and UN. The working lunch will be devoted to “co-ordination of international organisations in the struggle against inequality”.Macron will then greet the presidents of five African countries and two pan-African bodies, for a working session on partnership with Africa.On Sunday evening, the summit will be enlarged to include the heads of state and government of Australia, Chile, India and Spain.Final sessions will be held on Monday, on climate, bioersity and the oceans, followed by digital transformation. The summit is scheduled to end with final press conferences, starting at 3pm."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.BBC ‘not building on Women’s World Cup success by snubbing games with small crowds’Gap between private and state schools getting top A levels is at its narrowest in a decadeBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsEndangered orchid brought back from the brink after habitat was killed off by rise of the carBoris Johnson to tell Donald Trump the NHS is off the table as he lays out red lines for US trade dealDisney makes \u0026#39shelter mutt\u0026#39 a Hollywood star in new version of Lady and the TrampSteam engine pioneer James Watt is among donors denounced by Glasgow University over slave links Heidi Allen has told Tories to join Remain Alliance or face electoral challengeHow Boris Johnson’s fortnightly calls with Trump reset the special relationshipComment: Political correctness battles show we have lost our common groundPolitical correctness has gone too far and \u0026#39exceeds common sense\u0026#39, three quarters of Britons sayComment: If we are to pay reparations for slavery, why not for the persecution of Catholics?US school spends $48 million on curved corridors and hiding places to foil mass shootersExam appeals should be free because middle class pupils have unfair advantage, private school chief saysComment: Remainers at home and leaders abroad have all underestimated BorisPolice officers ordered not to dance with revellers at Notting Hill CarnivalComment: Immigration levels after Brexit should be decided by the Cabinet, just like we do in AustraliaBoris Johnson will tell Donald Tusk that France and Germany are ready for Brexit talksMP Jared O\u0026#39Mara arrested on suspicion of fraud, along with chief of staff who resigned in Twitter tiradeSir Philip Green’s alleged groping victim tells billionaire to come to America to face her in courtWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/22/17/exoplanets.jpg","title":"alien life other planets worlds exoplanets earth science space","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsClick to followThe Independent TechOther worlds could be filled with even more flourishing life than we have on Earth, scientists have said.The new study could have significant implications for the way we search for alien life. It also suggests that search could be more likely to find life on exoplanets than we had thought.This is a surprising conclusion, said lead researcher Dr Stephanie Olson.\u0026nbspIt shows us that conditions on some exoplanets with favourable ocean circulation patterns could be better suited to support life that is more abundant or more active than life on Earth.In recent years, scientists have found huge numbers of exoplanets, or worlds orbiting around stars that are not our own. But they are all very far away – impossible to reach even with the fastest space probes, and difficult even to see in any detail.Researchers are working on a variety of ways to learn about those worlds, including telescopes that will be able to sniff their atmospheres and learn more about what the planets could be made of. But to understand the information that comes back, scientists need to build detailed and complicated models of how planets form and their climates work.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

The work was presented at the\u0026nbspGoldschmidt\u0026nbspGeochemistry\u0026nbspCongress in\u0026nbspBarcelona.Nasa watching planet for signs of alien life after discoveryNASA\u0027s search for life in the Universe is focused on so-called Habitable Zone planets, which are worlds that have the potential for liquid water oceans, she said.\u0026nbspBut not all oceans are equally hospitable – and some oceans will be better places to live than others due to their global circulation patterns.To conduct the study, the team made models of those planets using Nasa software, which allows them to simulate the conditions on those exoplanets. Using that Nasa technology, they were able to create models of the possible climates and oceans that could be on those exoplanets.They found that many of them seemed like more hospitable and flourishing places for life than even Earth is. They looked at the process in Earth\u0027s oceans that allows life to take root down here – and considered whether that same process could be happening elsewhere in the universe.Our work has been aimed at identifying the exoplanet oceans which have the greatest capacity to host globally abundant and active life, said Dr Olson in a statement.Life in Earth\u0027s oceans depends on upwelling (upward flow) which returns nutrients from the dark depths of the ocean to the sunlit portions of the ocean where photosynthetic life lives. More upwelling means more nutrient resupply, which means more biological activity.These are the conditions we need to look for on exoplanets.By modelling a variety of different exoplanets, the researchers were able to think about which types would be most likely to develop and then sustain life. And they were surprised to find that Earth is not the best kind – and that there may be other worlds out there that are a far better place for life to begin.We have used an ocean circulation model to identify which planets will have the most efficient upwelling and thus offer particularly hospitable oceans, she said.\u0026nbspWe found that higher atmospheric density, slower rotation rates, and the presence of continents all yield higher upwelling rates.A further implication is that Earth might not be optimally habitable – and life elsewhere may enjoy a planet that is even more hospitable than our own.The work is important because our technology means that we are unable to see everything: there is almost certainly more life than we will ever be able to see, even with the most advanced telescopes and other equipment. That means scientists will need to optimise their search by looking at the planets where life will find it easiest to find a home.We expect oceans to be important in regulating some of the most compelling remotely detectable signs of life on habitable worlds, but our understanding of oceans beyond our solar system is currently very rudimentary, said\u0026nbspChris\u0026nbspReinhard, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who wasn\u0027t involved in the study.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspOlson\u0027s work represents a significant and exciting step forward in our understanding of exoplanet oceanography.The new research could now help inform how new telescopes are built, since we now know what kinds of planets will be best to search for. Now we know what to look for, so we need to start looking, said Dr Olson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That amounts to\u0026nbsparound 1 per cent of Britain’s total trade, and 2 per cent of that with the EU.The UK has signed 12 other such continuity free trade agreements, aimed at replicating as far as possible the preferential access it has to non-EU countries via its membership of the bloc. Switzerland accounts for Britain’s biggest continuity agreement so far, with trade between the two standing at £32.1bn in 2017.Including the deal with South Korea, the 13 accords protect trade totalling £89bn, the government said. That is a fraction of the £634bn in export and import flows between Britain and its largest trading partner, the EU.Yoo Myung-Hee, the Korean trade minister, said the latest agreement will “remove much Brexit uncertainty” from her country’s relationship with the UK.South Korea is a world leader in electronics, steel and cars, and its exports to the UK reached £5.2bn last year. The country exports mostly cars and ships to Britain, while it imports crude oil, cars, ceramics and whisky.While Britain is still part of the EU, it is not able to negotiate its own trade deals, relying on the EU’s agreements instead. But once it leaves the bloc, it will be able to do so.\u0026nbspA trade deal with the US is likely to be high on the agenda. As a single country, it is the top buyer of UK goods and services, taking in almost a fifth of British exports, even though the EU doesn’t have a trade agreement with Washington. \u0026nbspBut the EU buys more than twice that amount from Britain, and a trade deal will be required to come close to the current frictionless trade.\u0026nbspBritain is working on continuity agreements with a host of other countries ahead of the 31 October Brexit deadline. But many discussions have stalled over the uncertainty about if and when Brexit will happen. For example, the government has already said the deal with Turkey, which accounts for 1.4 per cent of total UK trade, will not be signed in time.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And Lover, her seventh album, has the distinction of following up her most polarising, 2017’s Reputation often a dark and rageful collection of songs in which Swift embraced the “snake” within and refused to speak to the press about it.Lover, in contrast, has been all magic and stars, Swift moving past antagonism and finding love and emotional security instead. And critics have for the most part been impressed, despite reservations when it comes to the album’s length and some of its wackier lyrics.Created with Sketch.7 best fashion moments from Taylor Swift \u0027Lover\u0027 music video Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.For her opening look, Swift is seen wearing a bomber jacket from her clothing collaboration with British fashion designer Stella McCartney.

Again, the singer has dyed the ends of her hair to match the colourful scene.In a topsy-turvy room that sees Swift and her love interest playing board games on the ceiling, the singer opts for a Fifties-inspired look consisting of a yellow knitted top, matching flat pumps and white shorts.As she plays the guitar in a maroon-coloured living room during a New Year\u0027s Eve party, Swift stands out from the crowd in a canary yellow dress that features a ruffled hem. The singer accessorises the look with drop earrings and a retro-inspired headband.Butterflies have been an ongoing theme throughout the Lover album cycle, with Swift featuring them in both the ME! and You Need to Calm Down music videos. For Lover, the star incorporated the symbol with a patterned playsuit. She finishes the look with a pink hairband emblazoned with the word Amour, which translates from French to mean love in English.

But nevertheless it feels like an epiphany: free and unhurried, governed by no one concept or outlook, it represents Swift at her most liberated, enjoying a bit of the freedom she won for her cohort.”James Corden and Idris Elba appear on Taylor Swift’s new albumRead an extract from Taylor Swift’s diary in March 2009Taylor Swift removes controversial line from one of her songs“As a pop record of varying tempo, the pieces don’t always fit seamlessly, but Swift’s steadiness as a writer is enough connective tissue to prevent any jarring transitions or notable swoons across the track list. Free of expectation or any real narrative outside of her own making, she basically spends Lover doing what she wants, when she wants, dialing up the intensity in places and offering some of the most straightforward song structures of her career in others.”“In a world where TikTok savant and meme-lord Lil Nas X‘s ‘Old Town Road’\u0026nbspcan rule the Billboard Hot 100 for nearly five months only to cede the crown to teenage iconoclast Billie Eilish‘s ‘Bad Guy,’\u0026nbspSwift’s nonstop PR blitz and nearly algorithmic pop songs can seem outdated and unwelcome. Thankfully, Swift mostly avoids the ‘how do you do, fellow kids?‘\u0026nbspmentality and refuses to cop to too many younger trends on Lover. Instead, she perfects a winning formula, shooting her anthemic love songs and heart-on-sleeve lyricism skyward with ‘80s synthesizers and enough gang vocals to fill a stadium by herself.““Musically, the tracklist is a solid mix of upbeat pop bangers, dreamy pop songs, heavy bass beats that make you want to clap along\u0026nbspand devastatingly sad ballads but there are some tracks that get lost among the crowded field.

Swift (credited as co-producer) has reined in the digital excesses and punchy beats of 2017’s Reputation, and the sound is clean and lean, employing standard chord progressions and mid-tempo rock rhythms, subtly updated with ear-snagging digital sparkles.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fact that he has already given serious thought to Prevent will be an asset as he conducts this review.“In line with other reviews of this type, the appointment is at the discretion of the home secretary and has been considered carefully.”The review is due to report its recommendations to parliament by August 2020. Lord Carlile declined to comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It would also mean he must maintain continuous residence in the UK to ensure he earns the right to stay from 2022.Mr Wawrzyniak posted the Home Office letter on Twitter on Friday. ”This is ridiculous”, he wrote: ”Just to remind you: I am constantly on British media, I have cooked twice for the royal family, I was head chef at London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics”.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Oxfam activists in costumes depicting leaders of the G7 nations protest in Biarritz, France on the day before the summit is due to be held thereA vendor sits as she sells models of the Hindu deity Krishna on display at a roadside ahead of the \u0027Janmashtami\u0027 festival in Chennai A girl reacts next to Pope Francis as he leads the weekly general audience in Paul VI Hall at the Vatican.A masked dancer takes part in the Nil Barahi mask dance festival, an annual event during which dancers perform while posing as various deities that people worship to seek blessings, in Bode, Nepal.Protesters take to the street to face off with Indonesian police in Manokwari, Papua.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

That amounts to\u0026nbsparound 1 per cent of Britain’s total trade, and 2 per cent of that with the EU.The UK has signed 12 other such continuity free trade agreements, aimed at replicating as far as possible the preferential access it has to non-EU countries via its membership of the bloc. Switzerland accounts for Britain’s biggest continuity agreement so far, with trade between the two standing at £32.1bn in 2017.Including the deal with South Korea, the 13 accords protect trade totalling £89bn, the government said. That is a fraction of the £634bn in export and import flows between Britain and its largest trading partner, the EU.Yoo Myung-Hee, the Korean trade minister, said the latest agreement will “remove much Brexit uncertainty” from her country’s relationship with the UK.South Korea is a world leader in electronics, steel and cars, and its exports to the UK reached £5.2bn last year. The country exports mostly cars and ships to Britain, while it imports crude oil, cars, ceramics and whisky.While Britain is still part of the EU, it is not able to negotiate its own trade deals, relying on the EU’s agreements instead. But once it leaves the bloc, it will be able to do so.\u0026nbspA trade deal with the US is likely to be high on the agenda. As a single country, it is the top buyer of UK goods and services, taking in almost a fifth of British exports, even though the EU doesn’t have a trade agreement with Washington. \u0026nbspBut the EU buys more than twice that amount from Britain, and a trade deal will be required to come close to the current frictionless trade.\u0026nbspBritain is working on continuity agreements with a host of other countries ahead of the 31 October Brexit deadline. But many discussions have stalled over the uncertainty about if and when Brexit will happen. For example, the government has already said the deal with Turkey, which accounts for 1.4 per cent of total UK trade, will not be signed in time.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or perhaps it’s gingerism Either way, it’s smoke-and-mirrors nonsense designed to deflect from the reality that the public is wearied and irritated by the constant proselytising of a young couple who don’t appear to practise what they preach.This is the problem when Royal Family members abandon the monarchy’s long-held tenet of “never complain, never explain” and start making political statements about how the proles should live their lives.It’s an obvious side-effect that, emboldened by the proleration of social media, one’s once loyal subjects might rise up and have a few strident opinions of their own.Particularly when they’ve just contributed £.million for your “cottage” to be done up.Sir Elton John — with whom they have been staying on their most recent holiday to Nice — appears to blame the media for what he claims was a “distorted and malicious” account of the trip, adding for good measure that he wanted to protect the young couple from the “unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death”.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-rod-liddle.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentROD LIDDLE Public is tiring of Meghan, Harry, Andrew and Williams whining and hypocrisy \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-Daniel-Hannan.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentDANIEL HANNAN Dishonest Brussels stand-off with Boris Johnson is bordering on absurd \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT--e.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Leo Vardkars inflexible attitude towards the UK has made No Deal more likely \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-Tommy-walsh.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTOMMY WALSH Why building jobs are the best  wall is not lostyouve flunked your GCSEs \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Were not negotiating with the EU over Brexit, were talking to a brick wall Hmmm. Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed. Inner contentment is the greatest anti-ageing formula there is.Don’t I know it.In Mexico, The Bloke said: “Seen one old building, seen ’em all,” as I headed off to Chichen Itza and he headed for a sun lounger.And when I once suggested a safari in Africa, he replied: “No thanks, I’ll watch it on the Discovery Channel.”I got him to come to Rome’s Colosseum once, but only because it was raining and there was a recommended restaurant right opposite.Dear reader, I married him.MICHAEL Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have posted a charming photograph of a family lunch that includes their two teenage children, Michael’s brothers and nephews, and his once troubled son Cameron from his first marriage.Now , Cameron – who credits Catherine and Michael for sticking by him – has turned a corner and is happily married with a young daughter.Also there were Michael’s dad Kirk, , and stepmum Anne, .Proof,needed, that Hollywood royalty or not, every family has its ups and downs and all that matters as your le nears its end are the loving people that  surround  you.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And yesterday, clothing brand BoohooMAN were forced to swtly delete a video of a rat being kicked about by builders in a bizarre promo for the football season.Craig Jackson, psychology professor at Birmingham City University, explains the number of people mentally able to abuse animals is on the rise and shows severe warning signs of psychological problems.He says: Those who abuse their partners or torture their children often begin by taking their frustrations out on family pets first.For the angry, who feel they can no longer take out their frustrations on those who were traditionally “fair targets”animals may represent the last leforms they feel they can pick on. I certainly think that many in society are forgetting how to be kind and compassionate, and this is being replaced by the instant reward of notoriety and internet likes for uploading such cruelty.The problem is partially in the technology - seeing and sharing the videos is done so quickly that people do so without thinking about whether they should, or what the consequences may be.I am sure that both emotional immaturity and lack of any wider social responsibilities in le are key elements that allow sharers to do what they do without hesitation.The phenomenon is deeply worrying for animal welfare charities like the RSPCA, who have seen reports of abuse on s like Snapchat rise as much as  per cent in recent years.With a January study suggesting that one in five young children now aspires to be an influencer, there are fears that popular stars could normalise such behaviour among their impressionable followers.Houts has since apologised for her actions, and the LAPD investigation concluded that she should ultimately be allowed to keep her pet. It has led to concerns from PETA that “one day of outrage isn’t enough to stop streamers from hurting animals”.Sara McCorquodale, founder of influencer analytics company CORQ and author of upcoming book Influence, says the sheer pace of le on social media means that even the most shocking abuse can soon be yesterday’s news – and far from career-ending.“There’s a real culture of cancellation, where an influencer does something that’s very unpopular and the Internet community says ‘you’re done’,” she explains. “But actually because digital and social media moves so quickly, that cancellation doesn’t really last.“There’s also a really big narrative of redemption – somebody does something wrong, then they make a heartfelt apology video which tends to be very well watched.“What Brooke did will not haunt her within the community of YouTube. If she can put up with the trolls, it won’t ruin her career.”The stark reality of vlogging, she explains, means that only early adopters like Zoe ‘Zoella’ Sugg and Alfie Deyes can truly make their millions through YouTube alone.While Houts, in this sense, is unlikely to be hugely profiting from her scandal, it has undoubtedly raised her profile. A month ago, her page views were in the tens of thousands – now, her newest post has clocked up over two million.The squeaky clean image of Zoella’s generation is also giving way to a new breed of social media stars either seemingly immune to outrage or actively profiting from it. Many of them commercially far outstrip Houts too.Last month, gamer sensation Natalia Alinity Divine Mogollon came under fire for viciously hurling her cat over her shoulder while broadcasting streaming service Twitch, where she boasts more than , followers.A user with near-identical numbers revealed to fans that the service earns him a base salary of , a month – and that’s before even considering the advertising partnerships Alinity has enjoyed with brands like computer firm IBuyPower .Despite calls for her to be banned from Twitch following a string of controversies, Alinity has continued to be allowed to stream.More prominently, Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, who shot to fame when his girlfriend Kinsey Wolanski streaked during the Champions League final, was accused last year of animal cruelty when he filmed a stoned chimpanzee smoking a bong on Twitter.Crucially, Zdorovetskiy’s fame has been built on a fanbase that actually encourages his outlandish behaviour.“For a lot of YouTubers, they’re so immersed in the communities they’ve built they become quite unaware of what’s socially acceptable in a wider narrative,” says McCorquodale.“What’s acceptable in the real world and their YouTube channel are very dferent things.In December last year, popular YouTube vlogger Logan Paul sparked controversy after filming the body of a suicide victim.The clip, which was posted to YouTube, showed the recently deceased corpse of someone who had hung themselves in a forest in Japan.Paul earned millions of views within hours, but was widely condemned. He eventually removed the video, issued an apology, and took a month-long break from YouTube.The Sun has also uncovered a rogue steroids advert, a secret cache of porn, smut playlists designed to lure kids, and webcam sex ads on YouTube.The fear for welfare charities is that as we sht from the Zoella to Vitaly generation, budding influencers will pack in the make-up tutorials and instead seek out ever more extreme pranks to stand out from the crowd.In , the RSPCA investigated , cases of animal cruelty and says the number shared on sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Snapchat continues to rise.The briefest of searches on YouTube alone brings up dozens of copycat videos that have remained online for years.In one, a prankster replaces his goldfish’s water tank with a bowl of whiskey, to see how it copes. The comments, though attracting some criticism, are mostly supportive – with one user joking “that fish’s eyes must be burning lmfao”.Sickeningly, such encouraging comments are beginning to appear under more serious examples of abuse too. YouTube continues to host a  video in which a visibly distressed baby monkey is tethered to a post and fed alcohol, while another uploaded in January depicts a pitbull fighting a TIGER. It has more than , views.A RSPCA spokesman told the Sun Online: “It’s extremely concerning that animals are suffering and that this sort of content can normalise - and even make light of - animal cruelty.“What’s even more worrying is the level of cruelty that can often be seen in these videos, particularly as many of these online s are so popular with young people who could easily witness animals being beaten and even killed in graphic detail.“Celebrities, YouTubers and social media influencers have a responsibility to promote kindness and compassion towards animals, and to encourage their fans and followers to also be kind to animals.”The debate will rage on about how to best crack down on these channels.PETA may be calling for an outright ban for abusive users, but as McCorquodale points out, deing someone on YouTube will just see them jump ship to another website – and their audience will follow.“The only real way this could be regulated isthe law said social s were liable for every single person on their website,” she says.The RSPCA is campaigning for animal welfare to be added to the National Curriculum, and education remains the most immediate form of action.It’s time influencers like Houts realised a puppy isn’t just for YouTube, it’s for le.Educational, documentary, or scientic content such as content featuring animals fighting in the wild, such as in a nature documentary are allowed with the appropriate context and intent.The website has a three strikes policy, in which a user’s channel will be terminatedit is found to repeatedly post videos that include:In June, the government announced tough new laws that means owners who torture their pets will be locked up for up to five years – a rise on the previous maximum of six months.Dog fight organisers, farmers who neglect horses and thugs who abuse puppies or kittens will all be hit by the y jail sentence.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The two men were seen walking together a year after Epstein had been convicted.There are allegations — strongly denied by Buckingham Palace — that Andrew was more directly involved in Epstein’s sordid shenanigans.What cannot be denied is Andrew’s close friendship with the vile but powerful man.Remaining Epstein’s bosom buddy after he had been convicted certainly shows bad judgment.But then parts of Andy’s career as a royal have involved bad judgment.He apparently enjoys the retinue of rich and famous tossers who gather around him, no doubt anxious to be associated with the British crown.And he doesn’t seem to care very much how awful some of them are.This is shaping up to be a bad year for the Royal Family.Prince Andrew, never hugely adored by the public, could be a source of grave embarrassment to them.The public is also tiring of Harry and Meghan’s relentless political preaching, whining and hypocrisy. The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors. In Andrew’s case, befriending a scumbag has brought disgrace upon him and the family firm.With Harry and Meghan and William, it’s a case of trying to be too modern and thus losing sight of what it means to be a member of the Royal Family.Keep on this track and we won’t have a royal family for very much longer.A FADING reality star called Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has had a mega boob implant. She went for the maximum allowed in the UK – ml.As you can imagine, they look pretty ridiculous. She has a way to go, though, to beat doolally German model Martina Big whose baps check in at  litres.And indeed Lacey Wildd, whose  breasts weigh more than lbs each and actually glow in the dark.Maybe Aisleyne could next buy some jubblies that do magic tricks or something.IT’S not often this column comes to the defence of Gary Lineker.Truth be told, I’m a little bit weary of the jug-eared, virtue-signalling, overpaid, crisp-flogging dimbo.But he’s in trouble for having made a joke – not a funny joke, obvs – about his co-presenters being bald. That’s Alan Shearer and Danny Murphy.Cue outrage from the follically challenged members of the public.It is now almost impossible to make a joke about anything without someone wetting the bed and writing a letter of ­complaint.How did we get so thin-skinned in this country Lower the tone  Always happy to oblige.Stop bullying people, you third world dog-munching commies.THE Queen’s pharmacist, Ainsworths, is selling homeopathic remedies.These are remedies which do not work.Homeopathy is a charlatan movement in denial of science.One of the remedies sold is “Berlin Wall”. This claims to have the spirit of the Berlin Wall in it.And the homeopaths suggest it might be good for healing relationships.I used to think homeopathy should be banned outright.But now I think – hell,you’re dumb enough to believe that rubbish, good luck to you.BORIS Johnson is stamping around Europe demanding the EU scrap the ridiculous Northern Ireland backstop.He’s absolutely right to do so.If only this had been done three years ago, we’d have a decent deal and be free of the EU by now.But time is short. And the EU knows that Boris still doesn’t have a majority in parliament to push No Deal through, no matter what he says.So they will be less likely to agree to concessions.It just makes you weep at three wasted years.When we were led by a Prime Minister who didn’t think we SHOULD leave the EU.And caved in on every issue.Just two thirds  What kind of drugs are the other third on  Horse tranquillisers and crack Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t make a very good caretaker of a carpet warehouse, never mind PM.THEY’RE trying to improve the look of Sunderland. No easy task, you might think.And so the city’s Business Improvement District has put out a notice politely asking residents to stop pooing in the streets.Apparently it’s all the rage up there.The BID people said: “Disappointingly we’ve seen an increase in people thinking it is absolutely acceptable to defecate or urinate in public in our city centre. This will not be tolerated.”I think they’re being a bit heavy-handed. Maybe as a compromise measure they should just hand out little black poo bags to everybody.You Mackems, huh.

Without wanting to be trivial, he’s just into straight forward sex between consenting adults.”The Prince’s close circle insist he is not doing anything wrong and his desire to have frequent new relationships is one reason why he has not formalised his reunion with Fergie.The pal said: “It’s one of the reasons why I don’t think he would ever re-marry Sarah. They are great friends and wonderful parents but it would interfere with Andrew’s lestyle too much.“He’s a charmer but most of the romances fizzle out, and that’s why he’s kept the stability of being close to Sarah. He has the family side and the playboy side and he’s been able to balance the two for decades.”Andrew has been publicly linked to more than  women. After ing from the Falklands War in  — where he served as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot — he resumed a romance with American actress Koo Stark, said to be “the love of his le”.But the pair split in  after intense media interest.Before his marriage to Fergie, Andrew was romantically linked to two Bond girls — former Miss UK Carolyn Seaward, who went on to star in Octopussy, and KatieRabett who was in The Living Daylights.

The following year he dined with another model,Caprice Bourret, at St James’s Palace. Prince Andrew remained close to Epstein even after the billionaire was jailed in  for soliciting a minor for prostitution.This week Buckingham Palace said: “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes.“His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”PRINCE Andrew was reportedly seen in Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion getting a foot rub from two young women.The encounter was detailed in emails between literary agent John Brockman and writer Evgeny Morozov.Mr Brockman said it came when he visited Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial for child sex trafficking, at his Manhattan home.In the September  emails, he said he walked in to find a British man wearing a suit and braces and “getting foot massages from two young well-dressed Russian women”.The writer recounts how they discussed Sweden’s attempt to put Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on trial.Mr Brockman reports Andrew saying: “We think they’re liberal in Sweden, but it’s more like Northern England as opposed to Southern Europe.”He adds that he then complained about his public le, saying: “In Monaco, Albert works  hours a day but at pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants and nobody cares. But,I do it, I’m in big trouble.”At that point, Mr Brockman says: “I realized that the recipient of Irina’s foot massage was his Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.”Andrew, whose marriage to Sarah Ferguson broke up when she was seen having her toe sucked by her financier lover, was filmed at Epstein’s home in .Meanwhile, prosecutors in France have opened an investigation into Epstein.

A disaster. A “catastrophic ­national danger”, according to the feverish .They say Britain is on a “clf edge”. If we leave without a deal it will be a “car crash”.It will bring the “hardship of war” raining down upon us, says one Brexitphobic columnist. These people seem to live in a permanent state of dread.They’re forever fantasising about a desolate post-Brexit world in which there will be “riots, looting and disorder”as zombied Brits fight each other for scraps of food and bottles of medicine.The rest of us, however, have a rather dferent take on No Deal. Across the country, far from the political bubbles and ivory towers inhabited by these anti-Brexit hysterics, people are far more chilled out about the prospect of No Deal.You hear it in everyday ­conversations: “If the EU won’t give us a good deal, let’s leave without one.”You see it on Question Time when the audience applauds a list who says we should walk away from the EUit keeps messing us about. And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet. It’s a far happier place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Tory MP has blown more than £, of taxpayers’ cash asking scores of parliamentary questions about a Holocaust memorial just a few minutes’ walk from his house. Conservative grandee Sir Edward Leigh has tabled  questions about the planned National Holocaust Memorial Centre and Learning Service since June . Yet the MP has asked just three written questions about his Lincolnshire constituency in the same period. The right-winger has previously spoken out against the £million Holocaust museum project, dismissing it as “really just a gimmick”. And he has levelled a series of questions at the Communities Department, which is responsible for the scheme.    According to the House of Commons, each written question costs £ - meaning Sir Edward is likely to have lumped taxpayers with a £, bill. His Westminster home is just  yards from the proposed memorial site in Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Houses of Parliament.Labour MP John Mann, who supports the tribute and chairs Parliament’s cross-party group on anti-Semitism, said Sir Edward’s interest was “very, very odd in my view”.Mr Mann, whose Bassetlaw constituency in Notts borders Sir Edward’s own seat of Gainsborough, added: “It is surprising that he is so upset. “He’s my next-door neighbour and I haven’t noticed any opposition to the memorial from anybody in his constituency or mine. “I have had nobody raise it with me negatively at all and I don’t believe there is anybody who has any opposition at all to it in Gainsborough – probably most people don’t give a damn either way. “He needs to chill out on it.”    Mr Mann said it would be “helpful”Sir Edward revealed whether his interest stemmed from being “a near-neighbour” of the proposed site.Due to be completed in , the Holocaust memorial was announced by David Cameron in January , five months before he quit as Prime Minister in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum result.But the proposed location alongside the River Thames triggered opposition from a range of campaigners. Experts warn it will hamper views of the Palace of Westminster and worsen congestion around the World Heritage Site. Writing in , Sir Edward laid out his objections to the location - but failed to mention he lived nearby. He wrote in the Times: “This site is already a heavily-trafficked area. “The traffic and access pressure will overwhelm Millbank at a location not capable of accommodating such a volume of people and vehicles, especially coaches.

Nathan McGough immediately thought of the horror of nearby Grenfell Tower when his daughter told him of the fire at roughly midday today. And the three of them only discovered the fire had broken out when a friend on a neighbouring tower block told them via social media. The -year-old was enjoying a relaxing morning in his top-floor flat with his girlfriend and daughter when the blaze broke out at Markland House, less than a mile from Grenfell. Speaking toNathan, who has lived in the building for  years, said there was no smoke alarm.    I live on the top floor, the th floor, he said. I was at home with my girlfriend and daughter having a relaxing day. Out of nowhere they both shouted that the block was on fire. I looked out the window and I could see smoke. I looked down and I could see flames licking out of the flat eight floors below us. Thataposs when I realised something pretty serious was happening. We live next to Grenfell Tower, I remember that, everyone does.  Nathan, who now manages London band White Lies, quickly got wet towels, grabbed his two dogs and headed down the stairs to safety. It was pretty frightening. Once we passed the level where the fire was we felt a lot safer. Ever since Grenfell the fact I lived on the top floor was something on my mind. We knew that the stairs were the only exit. On the eighth floorthere was some smoke but it was not too bad. We saw firemen coming up as we were heading down. The fire brigade got there really quickly. You do not have much time to think, youaposre just in preservation mode. Once we got outside we felt a sense of relief. Afterwards, once the adrenalin has left, you realise that it was a really close call.    Nathan says he was told be a member of the London Fire Brigadeat the tower block that the cause of the fire was a residents barbecue on their balcony. A spokesman for the LFB toldthat a full and thorough investigation into the fire is ongoing and they would not comment on the cause until that was complete. Nathan said: After Grenfell we were told you could not have a barbecue on your balcony but it appears someone has ignored that advice. There was no alarm. My daughter was notied by someone who got in touch with her on social media. I have lived here for  years and I have never haerd an alarm being tested or anything. Each inidual flat does have a smoke alarm though.    Resident Dhin Chittenden told the BBC she cried as she ran down the steps from her flat on the th floor of the tower block. The -year-old receptionist, who has lived in the building with her husband for a month, said she was already fearful about another Grenfell Tower-type tragedy before the fire broke out. I kept thinking about that. If itaposs happened somewhere  then it could happen again, she said. A statement from the LFB said: Ten fire engines and around  firefighters were called to reports of a fire on a balcony at a block of flats in Darfield Way in Notting Hill.

Those most in danger are the elderly, people with underlying health conditions and babies and very young children.The level three heatwave  warning is in place for the East of England, where temperatures will likely hit -C between Saturday and Monday amid a number of big events, including Ed Sheeranaposs homecoming gigs in Ipswich, Suffolk.  The rest of England is under level twoor level one status, while no critical weather warnings have been issued for Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales.And with the temperatures reaching record breaking levels this weekend people will be finding it hard to sleep in the heatwave. However, one expert has come up with an unexpected tip to help people nod off when temperatures are soaring. Believe it or not, a hot water bottle could be just the thing you need to kelp you get a good nightaposs sleep. Expert James Wilson, AKA The Sleep Geek,explained: It can take us a bit of time to get used to the warmer weather at bedtime, particularlywe are staying in a place that doesn’t have air conditioning.    It is important that we feel cooler before bed as one of the important parts of the process our body’s go through to sleep is a drop in core temperature. If we are struggling to sleep because of the heat a great tip is to trick your body into thinking its core temperature has dropped. To do this you can either have  a lukewarm shower or alternatively, and this is a particular favourite of mine, fill a hot water bottle with lukewarm water and place your feet on it about half an hour before bed. The lukewarm water raises our core temperature slightly and our body reacts to it by trying to shed the excess heart, which means we then get a drop in core temperature and voila. We have created the right conditions core temperature wise for us to get better sleep.    The change in weather comes after weeks of unseasonable and unsettled weather which led to heavy rain and flooding in parts of the country. The Met Office said: There is a  per cent probability of heat health criteria being met between am on Saturday and am on Monday in parts of England.  High pressure will build across England, bringing very warm or hot conditions to many parts of the country during Saturday and Sunday.  Highest temperatures look to be across the eastern England, with western parts turning less hot Sunday.  "},{"url":null,"title":"girl 4 left wheelchair after","story":"NewsGirl, , left in wheelchair after driver high on cocaine mowed her downJoe Oliver, , hit the girl as she got out of a car in Maldon, Essex, leaving her parents cradling her on the roadsideShareCommentsByBrendan McFaddenAmir Razavi:,  AUG NewsJoe Oliver was high on cocaine when he hit the toddler \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Paul Page alleged paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell made frequent trips to the royal ­household, along with others. He claimed they would rarely sign the Palace’s official gate book, and royal ­protection officers would break the rules by driving them home and Andrew would become abusivechallenged. It comes as an email from  emerged in which literary agent John Brockman claimed he saw the Prince and his pal Epstein “getting foot massages from two young well-dressed Russian women” in the tycoon’s £million Manhattan home. Former Met officer Page, who served in the Royal Protection Command from  until , made his allegations during a  trial when he was accused of a £million investment fraud. The evidence, in a defence ­statement, was never disclosed to the jury but has been obtained by the Mirror. He made a string of allegations against former colleagues and bosses.    Page claimed: “It was not just the royalty protection officers who abused their position, members of the Royal Household also frequently did. “The biggest culprit was Prince Andrew. Andrew would often have lady friends come to visit, including frequent visits by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the disgraced late Robert Maxwell.” Maxwell has been accused of acting as Epstein’s “madam”, recruiting girls for the financier’s network of sex slaves, but she denies any wrongdoing. Page continued: “Very rarely would they have to sign in the ‘gate book’ when entering the Palace grounds, in direct contravention of accepted protocol. In ­addition, royalty officers would be told on ­occasion to drive these lady friends home when that was a clear dereliction of their duties.When on occasions officers challenged Prince Andrew and or his guests, Prince Andrew was verbally abusive. Any complaints made were not properly dealt with.” There is no suggestion any of the female visitors were underage. Page was later found guilty of the fraud and was given six years in jail. Former Chief Superintendent and Head of Royal ­Protection Dai Davies was his boss.    He said of the female visitor claims: “This did happen. Royals can bring their own guests into the Palace unvetted and unchecked. That’s their ­prerogative. It is their home. “Unless there was anything that would give cause for concern royal officers could not intervene. “It was particularly the case with that inidual who had a reputation for being fairly succinct with his wordspolice tried to intervene. He has been known to be abrupt with police, including myself on occasions. “It’s fair to say and well-documented that he was involved with a number of fairly glamorous good looking young ladies but I have never been aware, then or since, that any were underage.”Buckingham Palace said: “During the trial, which resulted in a conviction for fraud, Mr Page made a series of ­allegations about the Royal Household and members of the Royal Family, none of which were substantiated.” Andrew, , has faced claims by Epstein’s teenage “sex slave” Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, that she was paid to sleep with him three times. He “categorically” denies the ­allegations. The Mirror understands no royal officers were ­interviewed when Scotland Yard carried out a limited review of the claims in .  They include the Prince’s personal guard who travelled with him on Epstein’s private jet to his US and Caribbean lairs. A police source said the complaint, made by a third party who represents the victims of sexual abuse, did not proceed to a full probe because a judge in Florida struck out the “lurid” allegations against Andrew from a  court case by another Epstein victim as ­“immaterial and impertinent”. Scotland Yard said: “We can confirm the Met received an ­allegation of ­non-recent trafficking for sexual exploitation.

Isabelle, six, burned her feet, hands and knees at the Pefkos Beach Hotel, Rhodes. The youngster also coughed violently and developed painful blisters. Her angry dad, whose PhD is in chemistry, has shared video believed to allege chlorine was added directly to the childrensapos pool at the plush resort. And his we Francine, , posted online: So, with what I believe is sufficient time to allow Thomas Cook to commence their investigations, I have decided to share a video in the photos below of the hotel worker throwing chemicalsinto one of the pools. Do you have a holiday story  Email webnews@mirror    Isabelle was crying out after a coughing fit and her distress can be heard clearly in the video which was taken two days after we had reported the incident. The family, from Newcastle-Under-Lyme, Staffordshire, flew home on July . Theyaposve since complained to the large travel company. This is my daughter, she is  years old. We took a family holiday to Rhodes. Everyday she wanted to play in the paddling pool and we had no idea it was making her ill. Below is photographic evidence of chlorine burns on Isabelleaposs knees, hands and feet. Unfortunately we didnapost realise this at the time, we assumed that was caused by kneeling in the pool, Francine wrote. We also thought that her constant tiredness was caused by the heat. Nobody is talking to us despite the fact that weaposve submitted a comprehensive report with photographic and medical evidence. Not even a query to check that she is okay.    Dr Wheeler, Associate Dean of the school of Law, Policing and Forensics at Staffordshire University, has sent a y statement to Thomas Cook. The dad-of-two stated the white powder seen being poured into the water may have been Calcium Hypochlorite, used commonly as a bleaching agent. The statement reads: It was observed that, each evening at around pm, an operative would cast scoopfuls of chemicals, most likely to be Calcium Hypochlorite, directly into the water of each pool.  It would be more normal practice to introduce these chemicals through the filtration and pump system for the pools to avoid potential contact with public areas. Treating the apossmallapos pool by adding this material directly is especially inappropriate and led to the injuries described above and herein. He added: The chemicals were observed to sink through the water, which was only cm deep, and sit on the bottom of the pool without dissolving or dispersing. This was still present the following morning when children entered the pool, who then stood, kneeled and crawled directly on the corrosive chemicals thus causing the burns and pain experienced. In addition, the dissolution of the chemicals brought about by the children stirring up the water also resulted in the release of chlorine gas that was then breathed in directly by the same children, and led to the respiratory issues.

She is described as being in a coma-like state but doctors are baffled as to the cause of her condition having carried out all possible tests. The girl from Karaganda in Kazakhstan had seemed healthy and was speaking well for her age when she fell asleep. But she has not properly woken up for eight months, although physically she is still growing.    Her desperate mother, Shynar, a history teacher, goes to hospital to feed Ayaulym with home cooked meals by syringe three times each day. “She was my clever one,” Shynar said. “She was saying ‘Mummy’ and ‘Daddy’ - everything was right, an absolutely healthy child.” The mum added: “Every day she opens her eyes, and cries asasking: ‘Mum, do something so that I finally wake up’. “She just needs help.”  While she has been asleep, ten new teeth have grown.

However, that’s where the problems began for the manager in terms of his subs.Left on the bench was centre-back and club captain Josh Meekings alongside youngsters Callum Moore, Max Anderson and Michael Cunningham.Unless you’re changing a centre-back in the closing stages, that’s slim pickings for a game that size against a good outfit in Aberdeen.And that’s not me saying the kids at Dens aren’t good enough for the first team, don’t go doubting yourselves yet, lads.In a situation like that, however, with a few minutes to go and a goal up, experience is absolutely vital.With four minutes of the  left, winger Josh Todd ‘blew up’, in the manager’s words, and forced a decision on the gaffer. Put on a young player in Todd’s position to run about or opt for the experienced man, club captain no less, but change the set-up on the pitch that had coped so well with the Aberdeen attack.Meekings was the man chosen to see the game out but that allowed the Dons space up the field to start launching balls into the box and pile the pressure on the home side.Sadly that told and Dundee miss out on a trip to Tynecastle in the quarters.What it did show is this Dark Blues side will take some beating this season. It is clear more bodies are needed, though."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d5fd0042c2449.09480568-846x564.jpg ","title":"hundreds expected to descend on lochee for second gala day","story":"Hundreds of people are expected to descend on Lochee this weekend for the area’s second gala day.Organisers are putting the finishing touches to the event in which the High Street will be filled with the sound of music.Heather Henry, pictured, chairwoman of Love Lochee, said members of the group have been helping to organise this year’s gala day.She said she had been “really chuffed” with the feedback received from the inaugural event last year.Love Lochee was set up to help organise more family events in the area.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"trailer load of cash raised for marie curie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOne lucky winner can look forward to a cosy winter after winning a trailer load of logs at Mid Argyll Show.The sticks were donated, as in previous years, by Ardrishaig#s Alan Ryan to the Mid Argyll Marie Curie Fundraising Group for their stand at the show.

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"objections-lodged-plans-rocket-engine-test-site","story":"Scottish space company Skyrora has applied to East Lothian Council to occupy the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station coal handling plant for five years to build a temporary equipment test site.Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council hosted an event with representatives from Skyrora in attendance and raised some concerns that they had gathered both from within the community council and from the locals.Among the issues raised related to the results of the noise assessment that Skyrora had conducted on the surrounding area to measure the impact of the engine tests.The community council felt that not enough distinction was made between familiar noise and unfamiliar noise, with particular reference to the finding that bird song was the prevailing noise in the area.Also mentioned was the potential site traffic travelling on the B, past Cockenzie Primary School and therefore becoming disruptive, and lastly, that the security fencing planned for the site would not be high enough to guarantee that it will prevent unlawful access.

This is standard, legal practice.

For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays.

She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him.

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

into my knee and I tried to stand up because I had got a fright.ldquoI thought it was broken and stood up but could not put any weight on it and just fell to the floor. That is when the pain went straight up my leg.ldquoThere were about five minutes left and they were going to take me off. I could not stand up because of the pain shooting up my leg and they brought on the stretcher.ldquoThe referee then decided to call it a day.However, that was just the start of an eventful night for Ben who said: ldquoThey tried to phone an ambulance but since my leg was not bleeding and the bone was not sticking out of my leg they could not send one.

We were doing well but we could not really test the goalkeeper as much as we wanted to do. They have got fresh legs and they scored two goals but we never really tested the goalkeeper as much as we wanted.Tranent boss Calvin Shand was pleased it was not as serious an injury as first feared.He said: ldquoI think, at the time, we feared the worst. It looked a sore one and with him getting taken to hospital it was feared it could be long term.ldquoBut, it is not broken, which is a good thing and we will need to reassess it in a couple of days when the swelling goes down.ldquoIrsquom really disappointed for Ben, who has come back off holiday, back to fitness and had a good run of form.ldquoHe is a massive player for us and we are disappointed for us as a club but more for Ben as a player."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10305872.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour   s tortuous EU twist won   t halt a No Deal Brexit","story":"Europhiles in the Labour Party can hardly believe it. After three years trying to explain to bemused voters why Labour is backing Brexittheyrsquore now free to say what they always wanted: Labour is the party of Remain. Itrsquos out of the closet.Twitter trolls have been sent packing. The high priestess of Remain, the rsquos Polly Toynbee, has given her blessing. The hyperactive Labour peer, Lord Adonis, and the #FBPE philosopher, SC Grayling, are singing a duet of ldquoOh! Jeremy Corbyn. Tony Blair has been stunned into silence.However, long-standing Labour Remainers are just a little cautious about this conversion on the road to departure. And with cause. Mr Corbyn remains enigmatic, as always. It is not at all clear the Labour leader is personally planning to back Remain.:Bill for Citizens Assembly consultants nears pound,Moreover, Labour Party policy is still pro-Brexit. Its manesto commits a Labour government to accepting the results of the  referendum and leaving the European Union, ending free movement along the way. A General Election is possibly weeks away, yet an incoming Labour government is committed to negotiating a ldquobetter Brexit deal with Brussels.The new twist is that this new deal would be put to the voters of Britain in a ldquoconfirmatory referendum. But there is no presumption that Labour would campaign in favour of it. Indeed, leading figures like Ms Abbott and Mr McDonnell would clearly call for voters to reject Labourrsquos new deal.Letrsquos work this through: Prime Minister Corbynrsquos first act would be to approach Brussels for renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement. This would presumably include the things they wanted to tag on to Theresa Mayrsquos deal: Customs Union, regulatory alignment with the single market, job and environmental protections and so on.Now, there is every reason to suppose that Brussels would accept this new deal with alacrity, since it is very largely the arrangement it has with countries like Norway and Switzerland. Michel Barnier, or his successor, would welcome a prodigal Britain back into the fold. There would no longer be an Irish backstop because there would be no hard border.

Labour has always faced both ways on Brexit, but the new policy has turned incoherence into a fine art.How would this policy be framed in Labourrsquos General Election manesto  We will honour the  referendum and negotiate a jobs Brexit, which we will advise the people of Britain to reject. And wersquore not giving the referendum question because that would be ldquospeculative.Some in the Labour Party still believe that the ldquoconfirmatory ballot could be Deal versus Remain, excluding any No Deal Brexit. But this would surely be a non-starter. The Electoral Commission would say that such gerrymandering of the franchise excludes too many voters. According to YouGov, more voters are in favour of No Deal Brexit than are in favour of Mr Corbyn becoming Prime Minister.The last time Labour got into a mess like this was over the Scottish referendum back in . Tony Blair did a U-turn on devolution announcing that,the Scottish Parliament was really the ldquosettled will of the Scottish people, as the late John Smith believed, then it should be tested in a referendum. The wrangling went on for months. The hapless Shadow Scottish Secretary, George Robertson, was left trying to explain why there would be one, two or possibly three referendums before the settled will could be determined.:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideHowever, that constitutional imbroglio was nothing compared to Brexit. Scottish home rule was never going to determine the outcome of the  General Election because it was of marginal interest to the vast majority of UK voters. Brexit is the central question that will dominate the coming General Election, and probably the ones after it. Parliament has proved unable to address the question properly, let alone find a satisfactory resolution.If Labour had really intended to pivot to Remain it should have done it two years ago when Parliament debated Article . That legislation made Brexit legally binding, and a No Deal Brexit the default. It was the height of irresponsibility for MPs, led by Mr Corbyn, to vote by a massive  majority to authorise Brexit, on a hard timetable, irrespective of the terms of departure. It was, as the SNP argued, a Brexit blank cheque.Mr Corbyn now says he will do ldquowhatever it takes to stop No Deal Brexit. But this is like waiting till the bus is tipping over the clf before trying to do a handbrake turn. Labour could belatedly have prevented a deal-less departure from the EU by supporting Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement, most of which Labour actually agreed with. It chose instead to walk through the ision lobbies with the far-right European Research Group of Tory MPs.Indeed, Labour could have halted hard Brexit on a number of occasions. It refused to endorse a Norway option, Mrs Mayrsquos deal, or a compromise in the last-minute negotiations with the Government. Mr Corbyn chose to dance around the question, seeking a narrow party advantage. It was all tactics and no strategy and played into the hands of one Boris Johnson.My own view is that Mr Corbyn would be rather content now to see a hard Brexit. This is partly because he has always been a Eurosceptic, but mainly because he thinks Labour could capitalise on the chaos thereafter. When your opponents are making a mess of things, donrsquot get in the way.Itrsquos an electoral gambit, but a cynical one and voters may not go along with it.

Itrsquos also ubiquitous ndash just search social media to see it dealt out in droves to red-faced reactionaries, who in England would be called lsquoa gammonrsquo.But there was always an itch in the back of my mind when I heard the put-down, that I was laughing at a joke which wasnrsquot quite right ndash which was more damaging than it was constructive.The central problem with the jibe lsquoyer darsquo is that itrsquos using something which should be seen as a force for good ndash fatherhood ndash as a vehicle for attacking something thatrsquos bad: the angry, controlling, illogical and domineering voice of a male authority which is presumed not earned. The joke essentially equates fatherhood with Trumpianism.Fatherhood may have been about control and domination throughout much of human history, but for decades most decent men have been trying to change the definition and the image to one thatrsquos about caring, nurturing, love and kindness. Many, many men are uncomfortable with the stereotype that masculinity is about stf upper lips, and not showing your feelings, and endless Darwinian competition, or that fatherhood is only about discipline, that lsquowait till your father gets homersquo nonsense. Certainly, Irsquove been deeply opposed to those phoney and damaging tropes my entire le.Being a father has been the most important part of my existence. Both my children were unplanned ndash happy accidents ndash and fatherhood took me by surprise, but the change it wrought on me was immense. I suddenly found myself transformed through the experience of having children. My bad edges were knocked off and there was no time for selfishness or laziness. A side of me I had always wanted to blossom, blossomed. I found meaning in feeding and singing to a baby, in changing nappies and wiping up puke. I felt more of my real humanity emerge while reading bedtime stories, giving baths, and drying tears than I had at any other moment Irsquod experienced.You could pile up my so-called achievements in le ndash awards, books, degrees, whatever signs of professional success people use to judge themselves by ndash and burn them in my garden and I wouldnrsquot care, so long as you allowed me to say that Irsquod been the best father I could to my two daughters.Not long ago, a male friend, whorsquos also a journalist, wrote a piece which was seen as a little populist. On social media, he started to be referred to as lsquoyer darsquo. Irsquove known this man many years and the one thing I can say for sure about him is that hersquos a great father. He loves his children, and has given them all the emotional support and guidance he had to give. Thatrsquos enough to make him a good man in my eyes, regardless of what he may or may not believe politically.So here was a good and decent father being insulted and the insult used to hurt him was fatherhood itself. Wersquod never do this with motherhood.If we want men ndash all men ndash to changewe want to purge toxic masculinity, eliminate all those hangovers from the Bronze Age to the Victorian era and the swe just want men to be better, then for the love of God, I thought to myself, stop denigrating fatherhood. Fatherhood is the route to a man being a better man.This summer I found myself thinking long and hard about my role as a father. My two daughters both graduated from university in July, and I spent a lot of time with their two boyfriends over the summer months ndash two fine young men who it looks likely my daughters may one day settle down with, and forge families of their own.Their graduations marked the end of one part of fatherhood and the beginning of another. The so-called hard work was done. My we and I had got our children to adulthood, seen them educated, and hopefully raised them as happy young women ready to go off into the world on their own. Part of me felt elated that wersquod succeeded. Part of me felt bereft, as I know this leads to the moment when my daughters leave the family home, and I will be very sad without them every day.Their boyfriends, the young men they will likely move into new houses with soon, also represent a change for me, a time for me to step back a little. Once again, Irsquom one part joyful, one part tearful. If yoursquove defined yourself by your love of fatherhood, an empty nest can be a frightening thing to contemplate.So, the idea of fatherhood being used as a weapon to insult, saddens me. We should be celebrating the gt of fatherhood, not laughing at it. When I was a teenager growing up in Ireland in the s, the insult lsquoyer marsquo was common. It came as an implicit sexualised slur. No-one uses that expression anymore. Itrsquos base, pathetic, sexist. No-one uses the word lsquogayrsquo as a insult anymore, thank God. Motherhood and an inidualrsquos sexuality are things to celebrate, not denounce. But still ndash fathers are fair game.Irsquom not saying donrsquot use the expression lsquoyer darsquo ndash feel free. Do what you like. There will be no demands of the patriarchy from me. But I would say thatyou wish to make the world a better place, and men better people, then be careful of the words you use and the ideas you deploy when you want to take a pop at some idiot guy who deserves it.Now, of course, the irony for me writing this column is that in the era of offence, someone will not like what I am saying, and given my age and my race, though not my political inclination, I am surely ripe for the lsquoyer darsquo treatment.

This decision seems to be more to do with EDFrsquos financial problems than what is best for the Scottish public.Scottish CND said it thinks that both Hunterston B reactors should remain closed for good and that EDF and North Ayrshire Council should publish their plans for evacuation in the event of a nuclear accident.Donald Urquhart, the ONR deputy chief inspector, said the regulator had made the decision to give Hunterston Brsquos reactor four the green light after a ldquolong and detailed assessment of the safety case submitted by EDF Energy.He said: ldquoNuclear safety remains our utmost priority and we would only allow a reactor to restart with clear evidence that it remains safe for workers and the public.EDF, the French-owned energy company which owns and operates all of the UKrsquos existing nuclear power plants, said it had spent more than poundm completing the ldquomost extensive investigation of the reactor core that has ever been undertaken to prove the Hunterston plantrsquos safety.The ONRs project assessment report said it had long been known that irradiation would lead to shrinkage and cracking of the fuel channel graphite bricks within reactors.This was first observed at Hunterston in August , when it was found in a small number of bricks in reactor four which were known to be more susceptible to cracking.It was then discovered in the \"main population\" of graphite bricks in reactor three in October , and in reactor four in September .Inspections carried out in March  found that there were more than  cracked bricks in reactor three - above the operational safety limit. This limit had been set \"well below\" the upper safety limit of  cracked bricks.An EDF spokesman said: ldquoAs a responsible operator we work with local and national agencies to prepare emergency arrangements in accordance with UK legislation and international safety guidance, none of which supports the need for the pre-distribution of stable iodine to a distance of km from nuclear sites.ldquo In the UK there are areas which have been identied for specic arrangements in the unlikely event of an emergency.

It used these figures as an unquestionable, quasi Bible. Now the latest figures from exactly the same source show a Scottish deficit almost beyond belief, we are subjected to convoluted arguments from SNP supporters, basically discrediting the figures that show what many have said since day one: Scotland is infinitely better off economically and in every other way by sharing and pooling our resources with those with whom we share this island.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.YOUR frontpage headline, ldquoScotlandrsquos deficit slips to a record six times size of UKrsquos is simply mind-boggling and shows financial mismanagement by the UK on a gigantic scale, yet no one has been held to account for this dreadful state of affairs. It is of no comfort to learn that Wales and Northern Ireland are in a worse state andanything compounds the gross incompetence of those in Westminster who have been in charge of our finances over many decades of a North Sea oil bonanza. The Unionist-supporting media are besides themselves with glee at the dire financial mess Westminster has put Scotland in and actually have the gall to tell us to ask for more of this financial punishment along with the lowest pensions in the EU and the prospect of waiting until  to receive it. Enough!If the estimated figures which make up much of the GERS report are accepted at face value and ignoring the fact that they relate to Scotland being part of the UK, not an independent country with dferent priorities, we must ask ourselves can we really afford to remain part of the UK where all this pooling and sharing results in such financial mire for Scotland, albeit the deficit has been reduced under the careful stewardship of the SNP government In a recent article in the Financial Times by David McWilliams, comparing Ireland with the UK in the context of Brexit, the strapline said ldquoThe Irish are now % richer than their UK counterparts. Scotland has many natural resources far in excess of what Ireland has and the travesty is that for centuries the UK has exploited Scotlandrsquos natural resources in a way which has not benefited Scotland and in many areas we remain at the bottom of health statistics tables, with high levels of deprivation and shortened le expectancy. In a previous letter I highlighted the  McCrone Report findings that North Sea oil revenue should be used to aid Scotlandrsquos specic problems but nothing was done.There are still abundant natural resources in Scotland, including oil and gas, and now is the time we must use them ourselves as an independent country to help eliminate many of the problems suffered by our less fortunate people.

Fay Vass, the society’s chief executive, said: “We frequently get calls from members of the public who have been watching a hedgehog that’s been lay still in their garden for days.“By the time we get the call and the person gets the hedgehog to rescue, it’s often too late.“Hedgehogs don’t sunbathe. If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The exhibition-on-wheels is travelling around Scotland highlighting the importance of remembrance.\"  Poppyscotland’s ‘Bud’ hits the road to tell the poppy’s storyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A healthier way to travel...and the government hopes more of us will get back on our bikes or walk for short journeys, rather than taking the car.\"  Have your say on Scotland’s National Transport Strategy viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

His musical collecting and recordings pre-dates the Folk Revival of the s and s and consequently are unique.David Cook, sub-committee chair of Live Le Aberdeenshire, said: “We are delighted to accept this unique collection of local and national signicance into the permanentcollections of Aberdeenshire Council Museums.“Whilst the recordings are in good condition, they are threatened by physical degradation and some are stored on formats that can no longer be played. Being part of this national initiative will ensure some of our local recordings of Scots music will be digitally preserved and available to folk at home and abroad for future enjoyment and learning.”Alastair Hardie, one of the trustees acting on behalf of the late John Junner, said: “In his will, John Junner asked for his collection to be kept ‘at a suitable location in northeast Scotland’.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rehomed Horse of Year  Tinto and Fiona Bell.\"  Tinto has been so much more than a friend viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"\"Ten years after his death, his wish has finally been fulfilled with this donation.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period. I look forward to seeing the improvements that are made and the effect these have on our historic streets.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A refurbished and extended museum is expected to re-open during the summer of .Council leader James Stockan said: “This is a project of tremendous signicance for Hoy and for Orkney as a whole.“It has taken longer than we first hoped to get to this stage and it will be excellent for all involved to see work getting underway soon.“I am delighted that, like the council, the project’s external funders remain fully committed to the scheme.“When complete, the restored and extended museum will for the first time in many years open all year round, encouraging more people to visit Hoy and boosting tourism throughout the island.”The museum’s role is to chart Orkney’s military involvement in the First and Second World Wars and provide a safe home for a major collection of wartime artefacts, many of national and international importance.After a competitive tendering exercise, the contract for the work has been awarded to Orkney BuildersLtd.A temporary exhibition on the wartime history of Scapa Flow is on show at the Hoy Hotel while the museum is closed.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant. This will occur for about  hours per year, he said, and the firm is currently working on a solution to that.Mr Jonermark added: #We do not want this to be a problem for anyone. We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away. By next summer the plant should be quiet and there should be no smell.#"},{"url":null,"title":"100 per cent achieve a c grades at st louis grammar","story":"St Louis Grammar is celebrating outstanding A Level results with  per cent of the  Upper Sixth students attaining A* to C grades in three or more subjects.

Its job was to reforest the UK for timber after World War One had devastated huge areas of land for the war effort. Philip Parker from the Royal Mail said about the new stamps: On the Forestry Commissions centenary these striking new stamps celebrate the beauty and tranquillity of our public woodlands, and the inspiring range of environments which receive hundreds of millions of visits each year.Other forests featured on the new stamps are Glen Affric in Inverness-shire, Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Westonbirt in the National Arboretum in Gloucestershire, Coed y Brenin in Gwynedd, and Kielder Forest in Northumberland "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094371.jpg--.jpg?1566376116000\n","title":"outstanding 100 3 a c a level grades for st louis grammar school students","story":"ST Louis Grammar is celebrating outstanding A Level results with % of the  Upper Sixth students attaining A* to C grades in  or more subjects.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glasmullin green standoff continues into second day","story":"PROTESTORS have ed to Glassmullin Green amid a stand off over plans by De La Salle College to build a new sports facility on the site.Work was due to begin the £.million project yesterday, but campaigners moved on to the green in a bid to block the development.Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds left the site yesterday following an intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the space since .Residents resumed their protest this morning.Aithne Kerrigan from FOGOG has accused De La Salle College of acting “in bad faith from the outset”.“They have said that they have tried to engage with residents – they haven’t,” she said.“They held an open night at the start of April and they only managed to get seven people across their doors, four of which were definitely objectors. They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38415041.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/poll.jpg","title":"brexit poll saying majority backs irish sea border rejected by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit.https:www.belfasttelegraph news brexit brexit-poll-saying-majority-backs-irish-sea-border-rejected-by-dup-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece d AUTOCROP h poll.jpgEmailA DUP MP has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit general election once-in-a-generation chance for changeJohnson under pressure to recall Parliament following no-deal Brexit warningsSome .% of respondents said they would vote in favour of \"a border in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp greg hands weve found a solution to the brexit backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

I hear of a punishment shooting in Ardoyne. Shots to the leg. The rain is beginning to clear. Time to think about lunch. Just another Belfast day..pushThat is how desensitised some of us have become to the mutilation of men and children in working class Belfast.Almost  years ago, the image of Free Derry Corner signalled a brighter world of civil rights and new political beginnings in Northern Ireland.Idealistic longings were soon subverted by the brute force of paramilitaries who cared little for peoples rights but were driven by an all-consuming desire for an Ireland united by force of arms.Not long after, within a stones throw of Free Derry Corner, a young factory worker was being humiliated, tarred and feathered by a group of vigilantes. What we have come to call informal justice or the punishment system was born, or born again.It is hard to know how many have suffered at the hands of loyalist and republican paramilitaries who, in their self-important way, terry their own communities.I recall the words of the great political scientist and peace activist, Frank Wright: \"It takes after all very few people to kill enough people to frighten a very large number.\"Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetPolice estimates of the extent and power of intimidation are woefully inadequate.To get an intimate view of how force works there is no better source than Milkman, the award-winning novel by Ardoyne writer, Anna Burns.Rumours, threats, paranoia, swaggering gunmen, fear, sadism, and of course the invocation of a higher ideal all feature.For what they are worth, the PSNI statistics indicate well over , punishment shootings and beatings since , roughly equally ided between loyalist and republican organisations. This in itself is an appalling toll of human suffering.

The British government’s own analysis has predicted signicant disruption to integrated supply chains across this island rendering cross-border trade in our agri-food sector virtually impossible for many operators. It has also warned that the open border that has underpinned our political settlement would be unsustainable within months.It is our view that the progress made in developing integrated and enduring relationships on this island, politically, economically and socially, over the last  years is far too important to abandon. Particularly at a moment when those relationships are being tested.With that in mind, and with no ing Executive or Assembly currently in place in Northern Ireland to give expression to the democratic wishes of people here, we write to you to confirm our support for the backstop contained within the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration. It is our view that a legally operable guarantee to protect the Good Friday Agreement, maintain north-south co-operation and preserve the all-island economy and to prevent ato physical infrastructure on our border or physical checks at or near the border is necessary to preserve the progress that we have made.We trust that the approach adopted by the European Institutions to defend all that we have achieved will continue in the weeks ahead.The letter was signed by:Colum Eastwood MLA, Leader of the Social Democratic and Labour PartyMichelle O’Neill MLA, Assembly Leader and Vice President of Sinn FeinNaomi Long MEP, Leader of the Alliance PartyClare Bailey MLA, Leader of the Green PartyChris Lyttle MLA               Mairtin O Muilleoir MLA            John Dallat MLAMaire Hendron MLA       Orlaithi Flynn MLA                           Sean Lynch MLAGerry Kelly MLA                Alex Maskey MLA                           Jemma Dolan MLANichola Mallon MLA       Fra McCann MLA                             Colm Gildernew MLACaral Ni Chuilin MLA       Pat Sheehan MLA                            Mark H Durkan MLAPaula Bradshaw MLA     Stewart Dickson MLA                     Raymond McCartney MLAClaire Hanna MLA            Caoimhe Archibald MLA                Karen Mullan MLAPat Catney MLA                Conor Murphy MLA                        Emma Rogan MLA          Trevor Lunn MLA             Philip McGuigan MLA                     Colin McGrath MLALinda Dillon MLA              Steven Agnew MLA                         Kellie Armstrong MLAEmma Sheerin MLA        Stephen Farry MLA                         Dolores Kelly MLAPatsy McGlone MLA       John Blair MLA                                  John O’Dowd MLACathal Boylan MLA          Declan Kearney MLA                      Maoliosa McHugh MLAMegan Fearon MLA        Sinead Bradley MLA                        Catherine Kelly MLAJustin McNulty MLA        Sinead Ennis MLA                            Declan McAleer MLADaniel McCrossan MLA"},{"url":null,"title":"malone integrated college mum did everything for me when she was here so this is all for her","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

support the unpaid workforce at the closure-threatened Harland and Wolff shipyard while potential rescue bids are firmed up..pushTrade unions have called for a temporary renationalisation of the Belfast business to provide breathing space for the under-pressure workers while several commercial offers are explored.Davy Thompson, regional co-ordinator at the Unite union, urged Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith to facilitate the “bridging” support during a meeting at Belfast City Hall.The meeting came hours after the yard’s administrators announced several non-binding offers have been tabled for the historic manufacturer.BDO Northern Ireland said there had been a “healthy level of interest” in taking over the business and predicted other offers may also emerge.The administrators said they were extending a temporary unpaid layoff of the workforce until September  to explore the ious rescue deal options.While the workers are no longer getting paid, the layoff means their contracts of employment remain unbroken.The meeting involving union representatives, Mr Smith, city councillors and representatives from Government business support agency Invest NI took place as workers held a rally at the gates of Harland and Wolff in the east of the city.These people are sitting down there on long-term layoff, they arent being paid and the Government now needs to step in to do somethingDavy ThompsonAfter the discussions at City Hall, Mr Thompson told the PA news agency: “Our message was clear.“These people are sitting down there on long-term layoff, they aren’t being paid and the Government now needs to step in to do something – eventhat is a bridging renationalisation-type position they take until a bidder comes in and we get down to the preferred bidders and get the company sold, then we believe that is what they need to be doing.“I know the Government doesn’t like using the word renationalisation, I don’t care what they call it, they can call it a bridging position, whatever they wish to call it, but we believe they need to get those people back in and being productive on the ground and let’s hope they get it sold as a going concern – something we are very positive will happen, we are just waiting for concrete bids to come in now.”Crowd gathering well at the #SaveOurShipyard rally called by the @NIC_ICTU in support of Harland and Wolff workforce #ReNationaliseNow pic cQzmaMElj— Unite the Union NIAugust , The Government has resisted calls for direct intervention at Harland and Wolff, claiming its troubles are a commercial issue.Ahead of the meeting on Friday, Mr Smith restated that position but added the UK Government would do whatever it could to ensure there was a successful outcome to the efforts to find a buyer.“I am quietly optimistic that there seem to be a good number of people that see the skills available at Harland and Wolff and see the opportunity that is there and the Government will support in any way we can,” he said.“I realise for workers at the moment who are at still on contract but not being paid it is a very, very dficult time but I hope thatwe move things on we can resolve that as quickly as possible.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  RMS Titanic was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard Famed for building the Titanic, the shipyard went into administration earlier this month after its troubled Norwegian parent company, Dolphin Drilling, failed to find a buyer.The shipyard workers have occupied the site round the clock for nearly four weeks as part of a high-profile campaign to save their jobs.On Friday morning, accountancy firm BDO NI said: “There has been a healthy level of interest with regard to purchasing the business, assets and safeguarding the existing jobs since the commencement of the administration process.“This has resulted in a number of non-binding offers for the business, assets and employees on a going concern basis.“There are also other interested parties who are in constructive discussions with the administrators which may result in further offers.”It added: “The administrators, along with the unions and employees, have extended the unpaid temporary layoff position beyond the August   to September   to allow additional time to seek to complete a sale of the business.“The administrators and the limited retained team of workers at Harland and Wolff will continue to work with all interested parties and bidders as they undertake further financial and legal due diligence work in the coming weeks as every effort is made to secure a going concern sale.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The shipyard employed more than , people in its heyday The shipbuilder, whose famous yellow cranes Samson and Goliath dominate the Belfast skyline, employed

decades and until recently had primarily worked on wind energy and marine engineering projects.Known around the world for building the doomed White Star liner Titanic, which sank on her maiden transatlantic voyage in  after striking an iceberg, Harland and Wolff was one of the UK’s key industrial producers during the Second World War, supplying almost  warships.Prime Minister Boris Johnson

are all going to gather together and are going to strike back and that is exactly what has happened here.“We have said enough is enough, you are not going to treat us like nobodies anymore, we are not going to be your short-term profit.“We are going to stand at this gate and we are not going to move away from this gate until the people that we want to run our shipyard are in control of our shipyard, whatever it takes and we’ll stay there for as long as it takes.“We are not finished yet, this shipyard has a long, long history, we are very proud of that long, long history andsomeone out there thinks that they can easily take that away from Belfast, take it away from this community and take it away from these workers, think again because we are here for as long as it

They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years.

Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Within hours, the three Belfast brothers were back in Newcastle harbour where anxious relatives awaited news of their ordeal.Philip Sharp and his brothers Johnand Markhad left Minerstown Park Caravan Site wearing only trousers, pullovers and with only two lejackets between them.

He fired one shot straight at the lsquokeeper, one went wide and a cross which narrowly evaded everyone in the box.Killyleagh did prove menacing and in the th minute nice link up play between Charlie Holland and Darren McConnell allowed him to release Jamie Sharvin, but he hot straight at lsquokeeper, Mark Hynes.Thomas Healy was next up for the Whites in the th minute. John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson. However, his driven shot ended safely in the arms of YC goalkeeper Aaron Carberry.The visitors then had their best chance of the half in the th minute. Neale did well to hold off a defender and release Healy on the edge of the box, but his shot was fired just over.Both teams changed formations in the second half and Rosario really started to create some great opportunities.The game sprang into le when Johnson was put through one-on-one with Carberry, but once again the lsquokeeper stood up and made a smart save, with Murray missing the rebound.In the th minute Rosario were awarded a penalty. A long ball over the top caught the Killyleagh defence out with John Murray conceding a penalty and then seeing red in the resulting melee.Up stepped Ciaran Gillan, who struck a sweet penalty only to see it saved superbly by Carberry.In the th minute Killyleagh reminded Rosario that they were still in the game as Niall Walsh nodded a corner back into the path of Dylan Kelly who just couldnrsquot make contact with the goal at his mercy.It proved not the Gillanrsquos day. In the th minute he had a great chance, but managed to smash it over and in the last minute his shot hit the crossbar.With  minutes of football unable to separate the two teams it went to extra time and it was going to take a special goal to break the deadlock.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

It was a party exclusively committed to peaceful means. The IRA is nothing to do with us, he said, and it was about time the government saw sense and changed the way it was treating Sinn Fein.”In the second meeting,  days later, the lead NIO official Quentin Thomas asked Mr McGuinness: “If you don’t get what you want, what then ” Mr McGuinness replied that Sinn Fein did not know HMG’s real position on the question of sovereignty.

We have convinced most people, including the American government, the Irish government, the Europeans, John Hume and John Alderdice, that we are serious.”Mr McGuinness claimed that “as a democratic party they could not speak for anyone , be it the IRA, the UVF, the UDA or INLA, any more than, say, Peter Robinson or Ian Paisley could speak for these groups”. He told the civil servants that they had a “brass neck” to adopt a “moralistic tone”, given that “HMG’s actions over the centuries had created the current situation”.NIO official Stephen Leach reminded Mr McGuinness that the public perception of Sinn Fein’s close link to the IRA was “reinforced by certain facts, such as the IRA having sent a statement to Sinn Fein’s Letterkenny conference during the summer. The statement had been published in theand ... had been signed by ‘P O’Neill’.” The minute said that “rather feeblyMr McGuinness replied that one should not believe everything one read in the : he personally was unaware of any such statement and would be very surprisedit had been made. But he would check and report back at the next meeting.”Later, Mr Thomas again appeared to catch Mr McGuinness off-guard over his insistence that the IRA and Sinn Fein were not linked.Referring to the comment by Mr McGuinness, Mr Thomas asked “ for the sake of argument it were accurate, how did Sinn Fein think the IRA’s views could be presented at inclusive talks  Mr McGuinness replied that he had not thought about this, but he was sure HMG had, and would find a way.”In his note of the meeting, NIO official Jonathan Stephens said: “Mr Thomas took the opportunity, Mr McGuinness having referred to last year’s unauthorised meeting, to state thatanyone in the course of any unauthorised exchanges had given Sinn Fein the impression that the British government had a position other than its publicly stated one, then Sinn Fein had been misled.”Declassied files: We may not check gun forensics, NIO told IRA and loyalists Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF |

It began: “Mr McGuinness then asked Mr Thomas how Fred was [an allusion to the contact between the government and the IRA during  when an MI operative either acted without authorisation or with plausible deniability in passing on key messages]. Mr Thomas said he did not know. Mr McGuinness replied: ‘I think you do’. Mr Thomas said that he knew who was meant but did not know how he was.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Thomas, , then opened the meeting with a florid exhortation: “I am conscious of a moment in history. But history forms a gulf between us. It is both what ides us and what we have in common. The past hangs like a chain around Ireland’s neck, and around Britain’s too.The enterprise we begin is to find an accommodation, a reconciliation where these old links become benign and agreed. We must find a way to bury, with dignity, the sacrices, mistakes and horrors of the past.”He went on: “Because so much history does lie between us, there is also scope for recrimination. But I hope we can avoid that in this dialogue, because it serves little purpose. We shall seek to avoid the politics of recrimination .”He said that the government would seek to be “constructive” and pledged that there would be “no tricks and no gimmicks”.“Both sides are suspicious and cautious – no doubt with good reason – and we should proceed step by step. Finding our dferences is easy seeking agreement harder ... We have an opportunity. I hope both sides seize it. We have had communications failures before. We have been good at misunderstanding each other. Now we have an opportunity directly across the table to make sure each knows the other’s meaning. We must work to ensure that we do so.”He concluded: “History grasps greedily at our backs – ‘the mortal hunger of the martyred past’. But let us begin together to work towards the future.”Mr McGuinness began by saying that the government’s behaviour had been “reprehensible and incomprehensible” and he hoped that “this meeting marks the end of discrimination to which we, as a party, and our electorate, have been subjected”. Mr Thomas said that “terrorism in support of, and terrorism in opposition to, a change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland has done great damage and inflicted immeasurable human suffering – although it has been steadfastly resisted by an overwhelming number of the people of Northern Ireland.”The detailed minute, taken by Mr Beeton, who less than five years later would be killed in the Paddington rail disaster, said: “During Mr Thomas’s reading, which was delivered, in some contrast to Mr McGuinness’s style, in a measured tone and pace with much deliberate eye contact across the table – Ms Bhreatnach and Ms O’Hanlon wrote notes almost continuously Mr Kelly looked lean and mean, and very attentive, writing one or two short lines in his notebook Mr McGuinness appeared to take no notes and looked slightly nervous.”Mr McGuinness told them that “British sovereignty over the six counties, as with all of Ireland before partition, is self-evidently the inherent cause of political instability and conflict”.He said that Sinn Fein wanted a process which “culminates in ... the end of your jurisdiction ... in the shortest possible time, consistent with obtaining the maximum consent to the process”.We in Fine Gael want to see Irish unity – but not now Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Although Sinn Fein camein  to accept the principle of consent – what it had derisorily called ‘the unionist veto’ – Mr McGuinness told officials: “Your commitment to uphold the unionist veto is an attempt to predetermine the outcome of negotiations. The consequence of upholding the veto is, in effect, to set as your objective the maintenance of the primary source of the conflict.”Mr Thomas said that “there did seem an inherent weakness in Sinn Fein’s criticism of the unionist veto and their recognition of the need to achieve something with consent”.try catch  TrendingThese are all the mobile speed camera locations in Northern IrelandPolice

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns
