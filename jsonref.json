If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Boris dodges Commons sleaze showdown claiming say","story":"Share this article\u0027Cowering\u0027 Boris Johnson has no sleaze apology, no shame and no face mask at hospital - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"China Saudi Arabia COP26 negotiators accused blocking efforts reach climate change deal","story":"Share this articleChinese and Saudis thwart moves towards climate deal | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"why is niac bearing the brunt of criticism over vaccine boosters","story":"The EMA has green-lighted booster doses to be administered to adults ‘at least six months after the second dose’, so that  means anyone vaccinated after the middle of this year should not get a booster until the New Year.

Photograph:  Chris BellewFennell PhotographyAcademic Dr Martin Worthington has spent the last two decades studying a language that has been dead for thousands of years.Ancient Babylonian, or Akkadian, was the language of the people who once lived in what is now Iraq, a place known as the “cradle of civilisation”. The language vanished around 500BC.Dr Worthington, Al-Maktoum Associate Professor in Middle Eastern Studies at Trinity College Dublin, came across the language when he was studying to be an Egyptologist at the University of Leipzig in Germany in 2000.“Ancient languages have always seemed to me to glitter with a special brand of magic. As a child they fascinated me from the moment I clapped eyes on Egyptian hieroglyphs, and later I went on to discover that these are just the tip of an iceberg,” he said.“I had no idea it would be my career. I was coming from a background of ancient Egypt. Somehow it clicked. Babylonian philology is one of the few things that I really understand.”He estimates that there are around 100 people in the world who have some knowledge of anicent Babylonian and 10 who understand it as well as he does.“Am I properly fluent? Nobody is properly fluent. If you put me in front of King Nebuchadnezzar I’d have to think about what I was saying.”Enter Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)and its adaption of its comic series Eternals, which is about a time-travelling fictional extraterrestrial race of humanoids sent to save the human race from alien invaders.BlockbusterEternals is one of the blockbuster films from the hugely successful Marvel franchise which has produced the Iron Man, The Avengers and Captain America films among many others. Eternals has taken $161 million to date at the box office though it has also garnered mixed reviews.“I wish they would give some of that money to me,” Dr Worthington joked.It’s safe to suggest that more people will have seen the film than have read Dr Worthington’s Principles of Akkadian Textual Criticism or Ea’s Duplicity and the Gilgamesh Flood Story.In the film, the ancient language is used by immortal heroes who reunite to defend humanity from monstrous creatures called the Deviants, when they speak to inhabitants of the ancient city of Babylon.It is directed by Chloé Zhao, who last year made history by becoming the first woman to win a best director Oscar for Nomadland.The Eternals boasts an A-list cast including Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as well as Dubliner Barry Keoghan. Dr Worthington provided written translations and audio recordings, which the actors practiced with the film’s dialect coach.Brought to life“It was thrilling to create these translations and send them out into the ether for an actor to speak them aloud, imbue them with gestures, and bring them to life,” he said.“Film is such a powerful medium, which can summon a past full of moving, breathing and talking people. Eternals will raise awareness of Ancient Mesopotamia and its fascinating cultures, and I hope people will go on to explore them further.”“Thanks to over a century of scholarly work, we have built up a very good understanding of the structures and vocabulary of Babylonian as well as other languages of the ancient Middle East, such as Sumerian and Hittite. With patience and dedication, it is to some extent possible to ‘think in’ these ancient languages.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a what is article 16 and what could happen if it is triggered by the uk","story":"     The speculation is that the UK may use the triggering of Article 16 to go further and to force other changes, which could spiral into a trade war and the collapse of the Brexit trade agreement. Ireland and the EU expects the UK to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol in the coming weeks. This unilateral action would effectively suspend the operation of the protocol and have far-reaching consequences for EU-UK relations. So what is Article 16? Article 16 is part of the Northern Ireland protocol, the section of the Brexit withdrawal agreement which deals with the North. The protocol avoided a hard border on the island of Ireland by placing a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which means additional paperwork and physical checks on some goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. A small number of items can no longer be imported to Northern Ireland from GB, and some suppliers in Britain have stopped selling to the North. Unionists and loyalists are opposed to the protocol, which they claim has changed Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the UK, and has caused trading difficulties, and there have been repeated calls for Article 16 to be triggered to address these issues. In September the four largest unionist parties issued a joint declaration reaffirming their opposition to the protocol and their “unalterable position that the protocol must be rejected and replaced.” What does Article 16 say? Article 16 is the protocol’s emergency cord. If the application of the protocol leads to “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade”, under Article 16 either the UK or the EU “may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures.” It stipulates that these measures “shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation”, with the other party entitled - if the safeguarding measure employed creates an “imbalance between the rights and obligations” under the protocol - to take “such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary” to remedy the situation. The UK government has already said - in its Command Paper in July - that it is “clear the circumstances exist to justify using Article 16” as there has been “significant” disruption to trade between GB and NI as well as political and community instability. What happens if it is triggered? Initially, more talking. Annex seven - which outlines how Article 16 will operate - states that where either the EU or the UK is considering taking safeguarding measures it shall notify the other “without delay”, providing all relevant information, and shall “immediately enter into consultations in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution.” Neither party may take safeguarding measures until “one month has elapsed after the date of notification.” However, there is a caveat in the case of “exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action”, in which case the “protective measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation” may be applied “forthwith”. Given that the UK government has maintained the conditions for triggering Article 16 have existed for some months, it would be difficult to justify need for immediate action that said, it has already demonstrated its willingness to take unilateral action in regard to Brexit, so this cannot be ruled out. What will happen in that scenario? Practically, little is likely to change in the short term. Earlier unilateral action by the UK government to extend some grace periods indefinitely means the scope for change on the ground in Northern Ireland is limited. The speculation is that the UK may use the triggering of Article 16 to go further and to force other changes, which could spiral into a trade war and the collapse of the Brexit trade agreement. Inevitably, it will worsen the already strained relations between Dublin and Brussels on the one hand and London on the other, and will be seen as further evidence of “bad faith”, as Mr Coveney put it, on the part of the UK government. Strained relations - and indeed heightened tensions - over Brexit are nothing new in the North it will be seen as a short term win for opponents of the protocol, who have seen their demand to trigger Article 16 delivered upon, but in the medium to longer term it is hard to see how it will do anything to calm already troubled waters. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, summed up the potential impact for businesses he could easily be speaking for society at large. “What article 16 does it the opposite of what business needs. Business needs stability, business needs certainty, what triggering Article 16 does is give us not only more uncertainty, not only more instability, but long protracted negotiations again.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics sinn fein a party preparing for government","story":"At Sinn Féin’s ardfheis in Dublin last weekend, a motion in support of the non-jury Special Criminal Court was passed, representing a considerable shift in position and removing a significant hurdle to the party’s ambitions to lead the next government.

Photograph: Jan HetfleischGetty ImagesEuropean leaders from Copenhagen to Prague are under growing pressure to reintroduce tighter Covid-19 measures – across the board or targeting the unvaccinated – amid a surge in new infections across the continent.The World Health Organisation has warned that Europe could see another 500,000 Covid-19 deaths by February unless health authorities “reconsider easing or lifting measures at this moment”.Austria led the way on Monday with new laws excluding unvaccinated people from restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and theatres as well as events with more than 25 people.The new rules apply to all residents over 12, with a four-week transition period permitting access for those with a negative test and proof of one jab. Austria’s infection rate is up 60 per cent in a week.New fines for breaches of the new guidelines include €3,600 for a restaurant, hairdresser or other premises that admits an unvaccinated patron, and €500 for the customer.In addition Austria’s Covid app, used to gain access to closed spaces, will now only consider someone fully vaccinated for nine months after their second Covid jab, to encourage people to get a booster shot.The changes had an immediate effect on Monday with queues before vaccination centres across the Alpine republic. Interior minister Karl Nehammer confirmed the aim of the new measures – policed by 800 dedicated officers on the beat – was to “increase the pressure” to get vaccinated.Intensive care“Whoever visits a bar or restaurant has to expect to be checked, sadly this has become necessary,” he said.Announcing the measures, Austrian chancellor Alexander Schallenberg warned of an “extraordinary dynamism” in infections, with “occupancy rates in the intensive care beds increasing significantly faster than expected”.The latest incidence rate data – the number of cases per 100,000 of population in the past seven days – reveal the scale of the fourth-wave Covid-19 spike across Europe.Of the top 10 countries with the worst outbreaks at the moment, six are in Europe with many registering a doubling or tripling of incidence rates in the last two weeks.Austria has a seven-day incidence rate of almost 600, according to the database company Statista, while Slovakia is leading the EU with 961, followed by Estonia and Croatia with 838 and 760 respectively.The Czech Republic, where just 59 per cent of the population is vaccinated, is another European Covid hotspot, with a seven-day incidence rate of 500 and a 59 per cent spike in Covid cases.“The hospitals are being flooded with Covid-19 patients more than even I thought possible a month ago,” said Dr Milan Kubeck, head of the Czech doctors’ association. Ireland has a seven-day incidence of 482.Further north in Denmark, which abolished almost all restrictions on September 1st, the incidence rate has reached 254 and continues to rise.Public health director Søren Brostrøm has demanded the reintroduction of the local Covid-19 vaccination pass – showing vaccinations or recent test results – for access to indoor dining and cultural events.Pandemic plansAcross the border, Germany’s seven-day incidence rate on Monday crossed the 200 mark for the first time since the pandemic began. Berlin’s would-be coalition partners have interrupted talks to focus on new pandemic plans, set to go before the Bundestag on Thursday.The proposals are expected to avoid new lockdowns and will fall short of the Austrian model. Leaked proposals include regular test requirements for care home workers, more sick days for parents and the return of free rapid tests for all, abolished last month.Given ongoing disagreement between Germany’s 16 federal states, which have frontline responsibility for health, some capitals are pushing ahead on their own. The eastern state of Saxony, where incidence rates are twice the national average at nearly 500, has adopted the Austrian approach.Some 54 per cent of Saxons polled by local broadcaster MDR support excluding the non-vaccinated from restaurants, cafes and cinemas. Some 62 per cent viewed it as a “mandatory vaccination by the back door”.Through her spokesman, acting chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her “serious concern” at the situation and urged “people, business and the various levels of state to do what is needed to get a handle on the pandemic”.West of the Rhine, France’s infection rates of 6,600 per day are roughly one third that of Germany’s. But in a live television address on Tuesday evening, French president Emmanuel Macron is expected to outline new pandemic measures including booster shots. An Elysée spokesman said Mr Macron was “very worried about the health situation in Europe”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Circassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd wokeness derails the democrats","story":"US president Joe Biden: Many who were sick of Trump chaos and ineptitude are now sick of Biden chaos and ineptitude. Photograph: Jim Lo ScalzoEPAIn Shakespeare, when characters want to fulfil their desires, they escape to what’s been called the Green World. And that’s what Democrats promised voters: that they could leave behind the vitriol and aggravation of Donald Trump’s America and escape to an Arden that was cool, calm and reassuring.Democrats violated that pledge. On the way to that verdant forest, we got led into a circular firing squad. Tight margins in Congress do not bring out the best in pols.“We promised to change the rancour and ision,” said one top Democrat. “So we offered something else: ision and rancour.”Many who were sick of Trump chaos and ineptitude are now sick of Biden chaos and ineptitude. Scranton Joe was supposed to be the sensible, steady one. After all, as Democrats are keenly aware, Trump lost the 2020 race as much as Biden won it. Only 44,000 votes in Arizona, Wisconsin and Georgia saved Biden from an Electoral College tie.And for a long time now, people have been watching the spectacle of Democrats grinding away at the sausage and fighting for their piece of the pie (to make a metaphoric meal). And it has not been a pretty picture.There’s some truth in what James Carville told Judy Woodruff: “What went wrong is this stupid wokeness. Don’t just look at Virginia and New Jersey. Look at Long Island, look at Buffalo, look at Minneapolis, even look at Seattle, Wash. I mean, this defund the police lunacy, this take Abraham Lincoln’s name off of schools.”There’s also some truth in what representative Abigail Spanberger, a moderate in a tough re-election battle, told the New York Times’s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns about the president: “Nobody elected him to be FDR they elected him to be normal and stop the chaos.”Biden has pursued his two bills with Captain Ahab-like zeal he pines to be FDR and eclipse Barack Obama, who pushed him aside for Hillary Clinton. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hail the bills as transformational. But what are you transforming into?The election cratering showed that such overweening efforts are putting off many voters who are still struggling just to get by as they move beyond the degradation wrought by Trump and Covid.While the Democrats wallow in a family food fight, Americans are still stressed and exhausted from the whole Covid ordeal, confronting high gas prices and stymied from getting the appliances and Christmas toys they want.“I used to advise mayors, you can be as visionary as you want, but just make sure you take the garbage out and fill the potholes,” said David Axelrod, who oversaw messaging for Obama.Republicans have not lost their talent for coming up with boogeymen to scare white voters, and thanks to a dumb comment by Terry McAuliffe in a debate, they have succeeded in turning parents’ rights in schools into a wedge issue.Some in the GOP see Glenn Youngkin as a template for moving beyond Trump. The members of my family who voted for Trump are eager to see their party move back to a more palatable and recognisable form of conservatism. We’ll see.So far, tiptoeing around Jabba the Trump has had limited utility. Despite everything, he still has great sway in the Republican Party. And if the supreme court were to outlaw abortion and approve open carry on guns, that could scramble the equation all over again, sending moderate suburbanites back into the arms of Democrats.Most important, Democrats have to come up with a vocabulary and a vision to elucidate how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and Build Back Better will benefit people. BIF sounds like Willy Loman’s son, and must we ask, to BBB or not to BBB? Yammering about the budget reconciliation process is not going to cut it. Tonally and emotionally, Democratic pols seem at odds with the electorate.At the end of the day, Democrats are going to get some good stuff for Americans, but voters may not realise that because of the big hash the Democrats made with the bills. Asked on Friday if the Democrats could not get out of their own way, Pelosi smiled dryly and replied, “Welcome to my world. This is the Democratic Party.”She sanguinely referred to the damaging internecine warring as “exuberance”. Right now, the bills seem like a Washington abstraction, and it feels as if Biden has been lost in a maze forever, grappling with the minotaurs of Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema and progressives.It’s analogous to Afghanistan. Biden did the right thing pulling us out of the quicksand, but people are mostly going to remember the catastrophic visuals of the botched exit. There is a feeling, many Democrats say, that things are a little out of control – the Afghanistan departure, supply chains, crime, violence, Biden not being able to pass what he wants to pass or even pressing for the votes when he went to the Hill before he left for Europe.The administration lost control of the virus story it didn’t seem to have it together on mask or no mask, school or no school, vaccine mandates or no. Friday’s strong jobs report and a rollout for the children’s vaccine gives Democrats a breather, but many are still wondering if Biden is up to the job. He will need to become a much better salesman than Biff Loman’s dad. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ex council chief found washed swedish coast five months going","story":"A retired council chief, who died after going windsurfing in 40mph winds, was found washed up on the coast of Sweden 600 miles away, an inquest heard.Chris Bamfield, 65, a highly experienced windsurfer, was seen out on his board on November 14 last year at Hunstanton, Norfolk.His wife, Vanessa, reported him missing at 5.17pm after he failed to return to their home in Middleton, near King\u0027s Lynn.Norfolk coroner\u0027s court in Norwich heard how six search and rescue teams, lifeboats and two fixed wing aircraft were launched to find the councillor.But the search, which covered the entire area of The Wash, was called off on the morning of November 16 when it was assumed he was lost at sea.His board and its red and white sail were later recovered in the North Sea around 21 miles off the Norfolk coast, and his body eventually washed up on April 6 this year on Stora Korno beach in Bohuslan, Sweden.Interpol told Norfolk Police on April 20 that a body matching the description of Mr Bamfield had been found.The inquest heard that DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Mr Bamfield, who had recently retired as executive director of King\u0027s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council.A post-mortem conducted in Sweden gave his primary cause of death as drowning, but found that he had also had circulation issues.Reports from Mr Bamfield\u0027s GP confirmed he had been diagnosed as having high cholesterol, but had declined statin medication as he wanted to treat himself through diet and fitness.Norfolk area coroner Yvonne Blake recorded a conclusion of accidental death due to drowning while windsurfing.Ms Blake said: Although he had slightly high cholesterol, it didn\u0027t seem to be in the dreadful range. As I understand, it was not heart attack territory.She added: He was going out doing something he enjoyed. He had been doing it for many years and had all the proper equipment.It seems to me that quite a large search was launched and some time later he was found in Sweden and identified by his DNA profile.Speaking to Mr Bamfield\u0027s widow and daughter who were at the hearing, Ms Blake expressed sorrow that it had taken nearly five months for his body to be found.She said: I am sorry about the loss and all the uncertainty.

The figure compares with one million bookings made in two days when the programme reached those aged 18 to 20 in late June.The uptake in recent days came as booking rules were changed, allowing up to 10 million people aged 50 and over to secure an appointment up to a month in advance.Until the change, about 14 million people in England were able to book their third jab, once six months had elapsed since their second dose.However, changes in the NHS rules meant that 10 million more were able to come forward for bookings now. The vaccines will still be given only six months (182 days) after the second dose.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said on Monday that the Government was “making it easier and more convenient” for people to book their vaccine.“We know immunity will fade over time, especially among older and more vulnerable groups, so I urge everyone who is eligible to get online now,” he said.However, patients reported the site offering appointments miles away from home.Ryan Ogilvie wrote on Twitter: “I am obviously keen to get my vaccine booster, but I can’t. The closest to me is 20 miles away and only accessible by car.”Nigel Knight wrote that the nearest centre available to Brighton and Hove was 13 miles away.“None in Brighton or Hove when I put in my postcode,” Becky Reynolds also said.Jennifer Baker, in Hereford, said despite being six miles away from a vaccine centre: “I have been directed to somewhere 35.6 miles away.”Other people were able to book a slot, only to be turned away at the centre as they were just one day too early for the 182-day mark.Wendy Poppleton, 62, from North Nottinghamshire, booked her booster jab for Monday morning. However, the vaccinator explained he was not allowed to give her the dose yet and turned her away.Howell Harris, 70, from Durham, had his second dose on May 9 and booked his booster for Saturday, one day earlier than his six-month mark.“On Saturday morning, there were several people turned away in the short time I was queuing,” he said.Mr Harris said he was concerned “this glitch, if it is a glitch” could be resulting in wasted vaccines “if the vax centres are left with unused supply”.A carer in North London, who did not want to be named, was also turned away from a pharmacy on Monday after the vaccinator said she was only 181 days after her second jab.An NHS spokesman said: “In the very small number of cases where people have been able to book their booster a day earlier than the recommended 182 days, the NHS has issued guidance to local sites advising them not to turn away anyone who is within a few days of being eligible.”Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and deputy lead for the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme, said: “It is fantastic to see such strong uptake for the booster vaccine, with over a million people rushing to book their extra dose over the weekend and making sure they have as much protection as possible ahead of winter.“In just seven weeks, more than 8.5 million people have received their top-up jab, including almost three quarters of over-75s. And with eligible people now able to book their booster vaccine online five months after their second jab, it is easier than ever to get protected.“I’ve had my booster.

This was the latest incident in a week of disorder linked to the Northern Ireland Protocol.Last Monday, another bus was hijacked and burnt out in Newtownards. Then, on Wednesday night, at a peace wall in West Belfast, loyalist and nationalist rioters attacked the police, after a protest against the Irish Sea border degenerated into violence.These incidents reflect growing anger in loyalist communities at the lack of progress in dealing with the Protocol.This morning, the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), which is politically aligned to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), published a statement claiming that there is no longer a “basis for unionist support” for the Belfast Agreement. It’s leader, Billy Hutchison, said the Protocol damages the “principle of consent” that underpins the Good Friday deal and guarantees Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, until a majority decides otherwise through a border poll.The PUP is a small party, with no representatives in the Stormont Assembly, but its belief that the protocol damages the principle of consent which underpins the Good Friday agreement echoes the thinking of more mainstream figures, like the Conservative peer and former Ulster Unionist leader, Lord Trimble. Mr Hutchison stressed that he remains a “firm and dedicated” supporter of peace in Northern Ireland, but ministers will be worried that a group with historic links to paramilitaries is expressing frustration so publicly.The recent violent incidents in unionist areas were self-defeating and will only undermine the case against the Irish Sea border. But, though they are entirely wrong, you can understand why some extremists believe they will be listened to only if they create disorderDuring Brexit negotiations, the Dublin government, EU officials and sympathetic remainers all encouraged the idea that hardening the Irish land border would effectively invite terrorism by Irish republicans. At one meeting, the Republic’s then prime minister, Leo Varadkar, brandished an old Troubles press clipping about an IRA attack on a customs post, to emphasise his point.These tactics were successful at the time, but now they provide a twisted rationale for violent hotheads who oppose the Protocol. Throughout the Brexit process, nationalist politicians, Irish officials and their EU allies felt free to use inflated, even hysterical language about the UK, and the threats it was perceived to pose, while telling unionists and British officials to “dial down the rhetoric”.Today, for example, the frequently shrill and preachy SDLP MP, Colum Eastwood, urged Lord Frost and the DUP to choose their language about the Protocol carefully. Meanwhile, a senior EU diplomat told the Daily  that, if the government triggered Article 16, “We are ready for peace but prepared for war.”Ironically, people in Belfast will know this translation of a Latin adage best from a famously UVF mural, daubed on a gable wall beside an image of two masked gunmen during the peace process. It would be hard to come up with less appropriate, more provocative, more threatening language, in the context of Northern Ireland.From a unionist perspective, the problem with the Northern Ireland Protocol, as with the backstop before it, was that it prioritised nationalists’ desire to pretend that there was no land frontier on the island of Ireland over Ulster unionists’ right not to be separated from the rest of their country by a new economic and political border. To many unionists, it seemed that the nationalist case was backed up by poorly disguised threats of violence, as well dangerously hostile words.The recent incidents in Northern Ireland are unjustified and they are highly unlikely to achieve anything positive. While unionists in the province are currently at one in their opposition to checks and paperwork for goods crossing the Irish Sea, moderate pro-Union opinion is likely to become alienated from the anti-Protocol campaign, if it is associated with violence.However, people in Northern Ireland have every right to be angry about the Irish Sea border. Given the province’s bloody history and its long-standing constitutional dispute, there has, if anything, been a relatively muted response to its separation from the rest of the UK by an internal border - thank goodness.

MPs voted  to , majority , to approve a Government concession which aims to cut the dumping of raw sewage into waterways. The Government said its amendment to the Environment Bill will legally require water firms to make a “progressive reduction” in dumping raw sewage into waterways. Environment Minister Rebecca Pow warned water companies she will be “watching” their progress on sewage discharges “very closely”. But campaigners have said it doesnapost go far enough.  Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said the Government had been “shamed” into a U-turn on sewage but added the amendment did not go far enough. Mr Pollard said: “The amendment the minister has cited in lieu of the Duke of Wellington amendment is confined to storm overflows and not the sewage system as a whole. “There’s no specic duty on Ofwat or the Environment Agency to ensure compliance – and there should be – and we need to have a focus on reduction on harm rather than adverse impacts. This looks like looking busy without making a real dference.” Tories Philip Dunne and Neil Parish rebelled against the government in the last vote, but supported ministers on Monday.  Surfers Against Sewage said after the vote: “We’re hugely disappointed that the government has decided not to back the tougher Duke of Wellington amendment, which would have given them greater powers in tackling the sewage pollution emergency in our rivers and ocean. “Just last week, UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned world leaders at Cop to stop treating nature “like a toilet”.The government has failed to fully seize the opportunity in the most urgent of environmental decades to make an example of water companies to say, ‘If you pollute, you fix it, you pay.’ The vote comes after Peers backed a bid by the Duke of Wellington to compel firms to improve their sewage systems “as soon as reasonable”.  Ministers were forced into a climbdown in a row over levels of raw sewage being dumped into rivers and seas. Environment Secretary George Eustice said a new legal duty would be imposed on water companies to progressively reduce the amount of sewage pumped into waterways from storm overflows. Martin Salter, of the Angling Trust, said this new amendment did not go far enough.“At a time when public trust in politicians has once again been shaken, we hope MPs will stand firm, and insist on clarity and action by ministers to create a pathway out of pollution.” Comment MORE ON Politics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Aaron Bell, the Tory MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, said some Tories in the apos groupapos a nickname for the apos intake have been “beating themselves up” about siding with the Government. Mr Bell who opted to rebel on the matter, said his colleagues were put in an “invidious position” by the Government. “It churns you up beforehand and leaves you a little shell-shocked afterwards. Perhaps next time it will be easier.” And Tory MP Mark Fletcher, a member of the Standards Committee, urged people to not paint all Tories with the same brush as he insisted many are desperate to stay within the rules.Mr Fletcher told the Commons he would vote against the billhe had to today.  “I think that two years here is more than enough to know the dference between right and wrong, Mr Fletcher added. He urged the Government to avoid ordering Tory MPs to vote a certain way in future matters on standards, before thanking politicians on all sides for checking up on him following his decision to rebel. Their remarks appeared to show a deepening ide within the Tory party, with newer MPs expressing their fury over senior memberaposs handling of the Owen Paterson case. The Standards Committee had recommended former Tory cabinet minister Mr Paterson should be suspended from Parliament for  days after committing an “egregious” breach of a ban on paid lobbying by MPs.  But Mr Paterson quit Parliament before he could be suspended.Mr Bell even quoted a WhatsApp message sent by Tory MP Jill Mortimer, who was elected to represent Hartlepool in May. He told the House: “She said ‘this was a colossal misjudgement, it should not have been whipped, you should have been allowed to vote with your conscience on this’. “I couldn’t agree more and I hope the Treasury bench is listening. Let usto the convention where House business is not whipped.”  And former Tory chief whip Mark Harper urged Mr Johnson to demonstrate leadership and apologise in the Commons. He said: “I hope ministers can rule that out, I think that would be a mistake and most regrettable. “Theydeserve that decisions are well thought through and soundly based and , on occasion, as on this occasion…the team captain gets it wrong, then I think he should come and apologise to the public and to this House, that’s the right thing to do in terms of demonstrating leadership.” Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer slammed the PM for running scared.  He told the Commons: This week he had the chance to clean up, to apologise to the country and finally accept that the rules apply to him and his friends. “But instead of stepping up he has hidden away. Instead of clearing up his mess he has left his side knee-deep in it. Instead of leading from the front, he has cowered away. He is not a serious leader and the joke isn’t funny any more.”  Instead of making the apology on behalf of his party, Mr Johnson was pictured walking brazenly through a Northumbria hospital, maskless next to NHS staff who all wore face coverings. Number  insist Mr Johnson was following the rules and that he could not make it back to London in time for the debate.

Although she no longer has a budget, shes still shopping for cheaper options - to benefit the environmentVictoria has shared her top tips for having a frugal Christmas Image: PA Real LeByHarriet BulloughJessica TaylorReal le features writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsA bargain-hunting mum who has made it her mission to have a sustainable, low-budget Christmas admits she starts her festive shopping in January. Community worker Victoria Billington, , who lives with husband Simon and kids, five-year-old Teddy and three-year-old Elisabeth, has been bargain shopping for years. She first started looking for cheaper gt options a few years ago when money was tight and she had  nieces and nephews to buy for. In the past, the frugal mum has sted through books in charity shops to pick up novels for as little as p and even made a dollaposs house for £. In a bid to be as eco-friendly as possible, she also makes her own recyclable wrapping paper and reuses her homemade advent calendar every Christmas. She said: My husband and I used to be freelancers so we couldnapost always rely on how much income we were going to have at that time. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here So about five years ago, I started making a gt for each of the children on my list as it will be meaningful but wonapost cost anything. Now, it’s not really about the saving for us and more about being as eco-friendly as possible. She added that, of course, Christmas works out cheaper when sheaposs buying second-hand presents too, but she puts a lot of effort into carefully selecting each gt. Victoria, who has four sisters, said her family always valued thoughtful gts over expensive ones. My mum always said sheaposd rather have a bar of soap wrapped up than a really expensive present, she said. So we grew up with this idea of being generous at Christmas, but that doesnapost have to be extravagant.  In order to keep track of her bargains, Victoria has to be incredibly organised, and starts a checklist for all her recipients every year. I start as early as January, she said. I used to lose track when I started, so now I keep a list and write down what I’ve got everyone as I go. I really think about what each person wants. I don’t have a spend limit - I just try and make it meaningful to that person. Although she has no budget these days, Victoria still sets out to find bargains and scours charity shops for gts she thinks will suit her loved ones well. At some charity shops, you can get brand new, unread books for as little as p, she explained. So I grab a few of someone’s favourite books and their present costs me like p. I also found one of my nieces a doll that retails at £ for £, so Iaposm definitely saving a lot of money. Plus it saves any last-minute panic buying! After having kids, Victoria says she became much more aware of environmental issues around fast fashion and buying lots of new things all the time. “It broadens your horizon that itaposs not just about yourself. You start thinking, ‘What are we leaving for our children ’ “Iaposve always been quite thrty and Iaposve always looked to find a bargain. But especially in the last few years, Iaposve been thinking about where I spend my money. It made me realise charity shops and small businesses will benefit more from my spending as well as being more sustainable. As well as charity shops, Victoria finds gts on websites like Olio and Facebook Marketplace and often upcycling items to create cool gts.“I canapost draw so I wouldnapost call myself creative in that way,” she laughed.“I suppose I have the time. When I’m making things, I usually start with an open Google search to find out how to use a material or how to make a particular toy.“I got a lot of crafting supplies from Olio. I think for me that was one of my most exciting finds. Last year, Victoria bought a second hand dollaposs house for £ - and spent several weeks decorating it before gting it to her kids. She said: It was their big present so weaposd got it early and weaposd planned ahead so we were able to spend a while decorating it. Thereaposs tiny little bunting, made from paper and string, that we put on the walls. Victoria has a felt advent calendar that she reuses every year, putting chocolates and bad Christmas jokes in every day for the kids to enjoy. She also enlists hubby Simon to help making presents. Victoria said: My husband is actually very creative so he draws pictures that we can then frame and gt to people. We also make decorations out of pine cones. By just adding festive ribbon or felt greenery, you can make a wreath with a timeless Christmas feel. And none of their arty work is thrown away come January - instead it is carefully stored away in the airing cupboard in a reusable shopping bag, ready to use every Christmas. Although sheaposs proud of her eco-friendly traditions, Victoria doesnapost want to pressure other parents into copying her. I recognise I have the privilege of time,” she explained.Do you plan Christmas months in advance  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc“What we don’t spend in money, we do spend in time and I know not everyone has the ability to do that. “But for us it makes Christmas more special and itaposs really enjoyable to see everyone love the gts you’ve put so much time into. Victoria’s top tips for a sustainable Christmas * Don’t leave it too late – Get started early so you have plenty of time to look out for bargains. * Shop local – Reduce delivery and shipments by shopping in your local area. You don’t have to wait and can guarantee your presents will arrive on time. * Charity shops are great for a bargain – Many businesses donate brand new items to charity shops. Not only do you save money but the money you do spend goes to charity. * Watch how you wrap – Not all wrapping paper is recyclable and making your own can be a fun activity with the kids. Make it a family activity using stamps to create fun recyclable paper. * Don’t follow trends – You don’t need to change your decorations every year or follow the latest fad. Make decorations that are timeless that you can reuse every year.

Her four-day-old tot wouldn’t feed and was holding her breath - something her mum described as a bit like apnoea. “I thought maybe it was a little bit of wind or reflux. It was only momentarily each time,” Claire, from Bedford, told The Mirror. But the next day, she knew it was more serious. “[Ruby] kept doing it and she was turning slightly blue. I took her to AE with what I thought was tummy problems,” the mum-of-five explained. When she arrived at hospital with Ruby, a doctor witnessed one of the episodes while assessing her, and sent her straight to the NICU ward.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here During her first night in hospital, Ruby had a serious seizure. Unsure of what caused it, doctors prescribed her antibiotics and conducted an MRI scan - but the results showed everything appeared normal and Ruby was discharged.According to Claire, who now blogs about her daughter, that’s when everything “snowballed.”She said: “From six weeks old, Ruby started having these episodes every week. For the next year we were in and out of hospital but they didn’t know what these seizures were. “We didn’t knowwe could manage her at home because of rescue medication for her seizures. Sometimes, we’d be in hospital three or four times a week. For the first  months of her le, we spent more time in AE than we did at home.” While Claire and Ruby’s dad were consumed with worry about what was wrong with Ruby, she was also concerned about the toll it was taking on her four older children.  “They didn’t really understand what was going on. I felt bad having paramedics in the house all the time - it’s like your feet haven’t touched the ground,” she recalled. While doctors were baffled about what was causing Ruby’s episodes, Claire had a hunch of her own, that put her daughter’s seizures down to a traumatic birth in which she might have been injured or starved of oxygen. But when Ruby was eight months old, doctors called her for genetic testing. Nearly five months later, they finally had an answer. Ruby was diagnosed with alternating hemiplegia of childhood , a rare and complex neurological disorder with several serious symptoms - including seizures. The condition can cause temporary paralysis , delays in development, issues with balance and mobility, and cognitive impairment. The condition is caused by a mutation on the ATPA gene - but there are lots of dferent types of mutations, meaning people with AHC can all experience dferent symptoms. This makes it dficult to predict how the condition will manest in each child. In Ruby’s case, Claire says she’s the only known person with the specic gene mutation, meaning that for now, her condition is completely unique. The dedicated mum recalled having mixed emotions when Ruby was diagnosed. “We finally knew what we were dealing with, and I did feel relieved we knew what it was. “Then again, there’s no one  to compare her to. She’s one in a million,” Claire said. Now six and a half, Ruby’s AHC affects almost every aspect of her le.  Claire described: “She has absence seizures throughout the day. She’ll just be playing and will get sudden paralysis in her arm. “Fortunately, the hemiplegia episodes are short lived.” She added Ruby has ataxia, a movement disorder that means her walking is “wobbly” and lives with epilepsy alongside AHC. She is also on the autistic spectrum and is largely non-verbal. “The longest Ruby has ever been seizure free is seven weeks and six days, and that was only fairly recently,” Claire said. Ruby’s condition also means she’s at greater risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy . “Every seizure causes damage,” Claire said. “One bad episode and she can regress and lose everything.” Ruby’s condition means Claire “never switches off” and is with her youngest daughter all the time, apart from a few hours a week when she’s at school. She described: “Ruby and I share a bedroom. She has a seizure alarm on her bed so I can be alert to seizures  . I can’t remember the last time I sat in my living room in the evening and watched telly after I’ve put the kids to bed.” She referred to a documentary about the condition, called Human Time Bombs. “It’s an appropriate title because you just don’t know what will happen,” Claire said. She added one of the “cruellest things” about AHC is that it’s often overstimulation of some kind that will bring on a seizure. “It’s heartbreaking. At the end of lockdown I thought the kids had been through a lot so I took them to a chalet on the coast for a few days. But it was my worst nightmare. “We’d had a long journey and were in a new place with a new routine. [Ruby] had a seizure that night, so we came home the next day,” she recalled. “You don’t know what will be the trigger. It could be hot or cold temperatures, some foods, being in the water, or playing with her brothers. I couldn’t ever take her swimming or to a trampoline park, even though she would love all those things.”  Claire has to be so careful with her daughter that she even has to regulate the temperature in her bath with the shower head - making sure it’s never too hot or too cold. However, Claire noted her daughter has still managed to reach some incredible milestones. “She can say ‘mama’ and ‘dada.’ Just after her fourth birthday, she walked for the first time. That’s something I never thought I’d see her do, which is amazing,” the mum said. Although Ruby’s condition has changed family le forever, Claire constantly finds herself explaining AHC to people who have no idea what it is. “Almost everyone I speak to has never heard of it,” she said. “But it can still kill my child. Lots of children and young adults die of AHC.” She believes that, because AHC isn’t well understood, it’s underfunded and under-researched - something she’s noticed when she’s tried to raise money for Ruby in the past. “People are more likely to donate to causes when they’ve heard of the condition rather than something rare,” she argued.Claire is currently fundraising £, for Ruby to have pioneering gene therapy which could make a huge dference to her quality of le and even reverse her symptoms.But she notes it’s largely through the hard work and campaigning of parents of kids with AHC that the therapy was developed in the first place. “When you only have  patients in the world it’s dficult. If there were  million patients it might be dferent, but AHC is so rare that we have to do this ourselves,” she said. “It’s really important to highlight these rare diseases that don’t get as much publicity. For our children, this is a le-limiting disorder and anything can happen at any time. “For Ruby’s sake and for us as a community it’s important that people know what [AHC] is. Just because you haven’t heard of it doesn’t mean it’s not serious.”Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcShe added her intention isn’t to take away from the seriousness of any other illnesses affecting children’s lives, but rather to draw attention to a disorder that many people don’t even know exists. She asked: “Why shouldn’t our children have a chance ” Claire is has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Rubyaposs gene therapy.

In a bid to keep things as normal as possible, teachers globally have continued to go above and beyond, simply to make their class smile. One teacher desperate toto her duties as soon as possible decided to do just that - one day after she had brain surgery. Dedicated Katherine Meucci logged in from her hospital bed to say hello to her class and read them a bedtime story - as she normally does. The kindhearted teacher was keen to reassure her class that she will be back in person as soon as possible.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Katherine, , previously received the worrying news that she had a developing brain tumour. Although doctors thought it was probably benign, they were keen to remove it as swtly as possible, and she underwent brain surgery. But Katherine, who has been teaching at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School for seven years, was determined not to let that halt her teaching duties.So less than  hours after her operation, she took to Facebook Live to read a bedtime story to her fourth-gradestudents from her hospital bed.She had created the Facebook group years ago, in order for students and teachers to read a bedtime story to their friends at school. The teacher read the book, “Mr. Walker Steps Out” by Lisa Graff, and reassured her students that she will be back to school as soon as she can. In the video, Katherine, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, sweetly apologised: “I’m sorryI look a little weird. She added: I got this black eye going on right here because they cut open my head right here to take out my brain tumour. “You are my friends and you are an important part of our school community. You are an important part of our world and you are so loved.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

The man, who is thought to have fallen in the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave network near Penwyllt, has been trapped for two days having hurt his back.He has received medical treatment in the cave, and have been in contact with both the internationally renowned rescuers and other cavers.But this scary saga is far from the first crisis to take place in the Brecon Beacons, with a list of terrying accidents having befallen the sprawling mountainous national park. Where are the Brecon Beacons   Stretching from west to east Wales, the range is home to iconic mountains Pen y Fan, the Black Mountains, Dan yr Ogof all in a rugged and wild that in places seems devoid of human le.

Two years prior to that a Spitfire came down, killing fellow Canadian -year-old Sergeant Donald Perry Carruthers - it took nine days to recover his burned body.

The online sellers are also offering iety boxes of Wotsits and Quavers on eBay for around £ that normally cost around £ from sold-out supermarkets. One eBay trader from Leicester, where Walkers crisps are originally from, is listing a .g pack of Walkers Salt  Vinegar crisps for £. that would usually cost about p.  Another opportunist is trying to sell a g bag of Walkers Salt  Vinegar Squares for £.. It comes as Walkers warned suppliers that their products may not be back on shelves for another month due to an IT problem. A Walkers spokesman said: “We’re doing everything we can to increase production and get people’s favourites back on shelves. “We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused.” Supermarket shelves have been pictured with few Walkers crisps around the country and they are out of stock on Tesco, Morrisons and Ocado websites. The Walkers crisp shortage has now been going on for several weeks and a spokesman for the Poundstretcher group recently said they had seen deliveries of Walkers products plummet. He said: “They had a change to their systems and the change has taken much longer than expected. “In our last order, instead of getting  pallets – which is equivalent to a truckload – we received seven cases, which is not even a pallet full. It is that bad. “I was in Tesco the other day and the crisps shelves were empty, so I think the bigger supermarkets are being affected more severely as their sales are higher volume.” Crisp aisles are the latest to be hit with shortages, with retail experts also warning people may be hit this Christmas by a lack of trees, toys, booze and food including traditional favourites such as pigs in blankets.

He spent eight months in intensive care and then two months on a ward which adds up to  days in total, MyLondon reports. After a five-week induced coma and a le-threatening lung collapse, Andrewaposs health deteriorated to such an extent that in February, doctors called his family to tell them they were considering turning his ventilator off. Recalling when he first became unwell, Andrew said: A week before Christmas , I started to feel il. “I wasn’t eating and I was losing weight, but I thought it was just the anxiety getting to me. When I was admitted to hospital with Covid I initially responded well to treatment, but then my oxygen levels started to drop and I was taken for a CT scan. That was when I was told that I had a pneuomothorax, which is a split on the lung.  “I was on my own as this was the height of Covid, with no visitors allowed, so it was a lot to take in. By this point I was crying my eyes out, on the phone to my sister Hannah and my we Hayley, but I didn’t want to tell my mum or my dad. I couldn’t bring myself to tell them.” After overcoming a second lung collapse, fortunately, Andrew’s lungs begun to improve and he was able to come off the ventilator in June . Andrew’s family, including his we Hayley and sons Jack, six, and Joshua, three, were able to visit, although he could only communicate by pointing a stick at letters on a board.  In addition being on a ventilator in ICU for so long meant that Andrew had to learn to talk and walk again. “I kept thinking ‘why me ’,” he said. “It was very hard to stay positive. But I remembered how when I was going through my chemotherapy I was told to look forward, set myself little goals and when I’d achieved them set myself another one. So that’s what I did.” The last two years have been particularly traumatic for Andrew. Read more He was diagnosed with lymph cancer in October  but chemotherapy treatment had been successful and a few months before his Covid diagnosis, he was in remission and on the mend. He spent the majority of  carefully shielding due to his cancer fight. Doctors, nurses, physios and speech and language therapists at the hospital got to know Andrew during his stay.  They all turned out to say goodbye to Andrew on October . Andrew said: “The care has been fantastic but my journey is nowhere near finished yet. Going home is one major goal, but then that just starts another road in my recovery. I started walking just four weeks ago, and my next goal is to walk to my son’s school and back by Christmas.” Comment MORE ON HospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lincoln Crown Court heard harrowing details that Grzeszcz stabbed his defenceless victim in the neck, chest and abdomen before he tried to decapitate Roberts in woodlands in the Fishtoft area of Boston, Lincolnshire. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker sentenced Grzeszcz to a minimum term of  years in custody before he is eligible for release and removed reporting restrictions that allowed the young killer to be unmasked. The judgeaposs decision means more details about the teenager killer can be revealed for the first time. Grzeszcz was expelled from primary school at the age of  after threatening a girl with a kne. The killer had taken a blade with him to class and threatened the terried youngster at St Nicholas Primary School in Boston, Lincolnshire, the Sun reports. Grzeszcz was moved to Haven High Academy but was kicked out for selling drugs and sent to a pupil referral unit.  A mum, who used to take Roberts to primary school with her children, told The Sun: “It’s not his first incident with a kne. “When he was at primary school he took one into class to threaten other kids. He threatened a girl with it and was excluded.” Roberts was a pupil at Haven High Academy and was two days from his th birthday when he died in Grzeszczaposs hands. Grzeszcz refused to talk about the circumstances of the murder but the court heard it was a planned and premeditated killing. Brendan Kelly, QC, mitigating for Grzeszcz, told the court it was accepted that at some point he formed an intention to kill Roberts.  But Mr Kelly argued there was some evidence to suggest that was not the entire plan and something went wrong. Mr Kelly said while it was no excuse, the boy was a troubled young man who been through a period of chaos during the whole of  with his parents, and perhaps unwittingly the authorities. The net effect a troubled young man, Mr Kelly explained. Grzeszcz, who lived near to the grassy area where Roberts body was found, was found guilty of murder at a trial earlier this year but could not be named until Mr Justice Baker lted an anonymity order at his sentencing hearing today. Grzeszcz was today given a sentence of detention at Her Majestyaposs Pleasure and must serve a minimum term of  years in custody before he is eligible for release. The defence opposed an application for the boy to be named, telling the court that both his parents were in court, and were concerned about him being identied.  The court heard Robert had suffered wounds consistent with an attempt to remove his head before his body was found. Passing sentence at Lincoln Crown Court, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, told Grzeszcz, now , that it was an aggravating feature that he had made a substantial effort to remove the deceasedaposs head.Mr Justice Baker told him: I am sure that as the attack progressed, given the number of serious injuries you inflicted on the deceased, there came a point where you decided to kill the deceased, and you did so. He added: There was a signicant degree of planning and premeditation, including luring the deceased to the scene, and taking the kne with you. Mr Justice Baker said the killing was further aggravated by Grzeszczaposs attempts to conceal evidence - with police finding both the murder weapon and other knives hidden around his bedroom. He noted Grzeszcz was also still unwilling to talk about the circumstances of the murder.  Roberts, who was born in Latvia, lived with his father Edgars just a short walk from where he was killed. He was a pupil at the local Haven High Academy and was due to celebrate his th birthday a couple of days after his death. His father watched on from the public gallery as Mary Loram, QC, prosecuting, gave details of their le in the UK. Miss Loram said: Father and son moved to England from Latvia when Roberts was seven. He made friends easily, learned English and initially at least did well at school. He took up sports, judo and football. It is clear his father worked hard. In his previous statement he says aposhe didnapost have much, but they made sure Roberts had what was needed.apos Miss Loram also read out a brief further victim impact statement from Robertsapos father. In the statement Mr Buncis described how do I put into words what happened to Roberts. His death at the hands of another boy, over what, drugs, fighting, girls, it doesnapost make sense. Mr Buncis added: Iaposve lost my destination, my purpose, my le is in the cemetery. Miss Loram said it was the prosecution case that it was a planned and premeditated killing, with no evidence to suggest Roberts was armed as well. For an adult the starting point is  years, as we say the defendant carried a kne to the scene. However it is important to state that given the defendantaposs age the starting point is  years. That is set down by law.  Mr Kelly said a letter from Childrenaposs Services at Lincolnshire County Council also explained their concerns on naming Grzeszcz for his welfare and that of his family. The jury heard Roberts was found on ground off Alcorn Green in Fishtoft, near Boston, two days before his th birthday. Pathologist Prof Guy Rutty, who examined his body, said he had identied  sites of injury across the neck, chest and abdomen, some containing up to  separate injuries. As well as an attempt to decapitate Roberts he said there were also injuries consistent with someone trying to remove the hand or fingers. Prosecutors said the defendant used such force the tip of the kne broke off and was later found embedded in Robertsapos skull. Giving evidence, the teen claimed he had met up with his friend to hand over a stash of drugs for him to sell, but began arguing when he did not receive the £ payment he was expecting.  Following the attack, Grzeszcz ran home and tried to hide the kne and burn the clothes and gloves he was wearing. He later messaged a friend saying things went wrong and this wasnapost supposed to go down like this. Miss Loram said Grzeszcz had previously discussed a plan with Roberts to rob a shop in order to get money to set himself up as a drug dealer. But, she said, Roberts described the proposal as too mad and refused to be involved. She told the court Grzeszcz feared that Roberts would snitch on him. During the three week trial the jury heard the Grzeszcz also had a collection of knives in his bedroom and had been excluded from his primary school for taking a kne into class.  The jury was told by a fellow pupil that the Grzeszcz routinely carried a kne and would take a blade into his secondary school. At the time of the murder the boy had been excluded for drug dealing in the school. He had previously discussed with Roberts a plan to carry out a kne-point robbery of a shop to get money so he could set up as a drug dealer. The robbery never happened after Roberts described the proposal as “too mad” and refused to be involved. But five days before the murder Grzeszcz carried out a street attack on another boy who was punched and kicked on his way to school. Miss Loram said Grzeszcz intended to set up as a cannabis dealer, and apparently feared that Roberts would snitch on him. He messaged another boy saying “Rob’s a liability” which was met with the response “If he snitch, smack time”. Det Chf Insp Richard Myszczyszyn, of Lincolnshire police, said: “This is an utterly tragic case. I would like to pay tribute to the people who loved Roberts, and had to deal with losing him in such brutal and horric circumstances. Their support for our investigation has been unwavering, and their bravery has been an inspiration. Nothing could bring Roberts back, but our commitment was to try to find some semblance of justice for a grieving family and community. The act was utterly senseless and the consequences, devastating. It will be remembered by officers and staff as one of the worst and saddest cases we have ever dealt with. The level of violence, and that it involved children, makes it almost incomprehensible. “Roberts’s future was stolen and that is an injustice that cannot be undone. We hope today’s sentence might at least offer some closure to those affected. “It’s a stark and chilling lesson on the potential devastation of kne crime.

Sue, a lurcher, was only a small puppy when she arrived at Bath Cats and Dogs Home in August . She was briefly adopted in  but was ed to the shelter because of changes in her new owneraposs circumstances that made keeping her too dficult. Staff at the shelter remain perplexed that she is yet to be chosen by new owners, and have made it their goal to get her into a new home by the end of the year.Sue has some ‘challenging behaviours’ but kennel staff say they are entirely workable. She can’t live with children or other animals and she needs to wear a muzzle while out walking which is typical of Lurchers.Vanessa Langford, spokesperson for Bath Cats and Dogs Home, said: All of our animal care team love her. She’s really people focused, she loves toys and she’s very social, she won’t sit in a corner and not do a lot. “The other really nice thing about her is that sheaposs clever. She likes to learn new stuff. She can already do things like paw and sit. She loves learning because it’s human interaction. “She definitely has some challenging behaviours so she will need an experienced owner, but it’s sad because she’s such a sweet dog.” She is in need of an aposexperienced and patientapos owner, with a secure garden so that she cannot jump out. Vanessa says lots of people have called already wanting to provide her a home, but the restrictions sometimes mean she wouldnapost be secure there.  People are being really lovely and want her but we can’t take that risk of her getting over-excited with another dog or child, that way it wouldn’t be her fault. “The last thing we want is her coming back again. She has a great home here but we know that she would be much happier with someone  where she can chill out. She is an affectionate girl and loves a cuddle on the sofa just as much as she loves playing with her toys. “As much as we love her, she would be happier in a house with a loving owner.” You can put yourself up as a candidate to take this dog or other dogs in need on at rehoming@bcdh.org.uk.

Hannah, a -year-old mum-of-two took her boys to the stock car racing evening, promising them it would be a night to remember. But she has now told of how they begged to go home, after the cars got stuck in the mud and they were left sitting cold and bored in the overcrowded stadium waiting for the entertainment to continue. Hannah, from Brighouse in West Yorks, spent £ on tickets for her, her children and her mum at the event at Odsal Top on Saturday night.She told Yorkshire Live there must have been “around , people there along with a lot of disappointed children”.I had been bigging it up to my sons aged eight and two, telling them how great it was going to be but all they kept asking me was when could they go home,” she said. It was meant to be stock car racing, banger racing, monster trucks and £, of fireworks. The whole thing from start to finish was a disaster and should have been brought to a close a lot sooner than it was. Were you at the event  Email webnews@mirror  It started at .pm and ended at .pm and most of this time we were just sat around cold and bored waiting for the tractors to pull the cars off the track as it was a mud bath. There were four races that lasted a small amount of time due to all the cars getting stuck in the mud then an hour waiting for the tractors to get them all off the track in-between each. The monster truck was cancelled due to health and safety which I can not understand when itaposs a lot bigger than the tractors that are absolutely fine on the track. The children were bored as there was nothing to entertain them at all. Rather than put another two races on the fireworks should have just been done early and the event ended early. Forty-five minutes before the end three-quarters of the people attending had left - thataposs how bad it was. We spoke to a few stewards who all agreed what a shambles it was and that the event should have been ended earlier. We waited until the end as after sitting in the cold for hours of no entertainment we thought we might as well see the fireworks.”  But the family ended up wishing they had gone to a standard bonfire, in which Hannah said the fireworks would have been just as good. We were utterly disappointed with it all and felt it was a complete waste of money, especially for the price we paid,” she said. “Iaposm pretty sure everyone  who attended would agree which clearly showed how many people left early.” Hannah said the “poor stewards” were being abused by attendees unhappy with their experience, which she said was “also unfair”.And another man wrote on Startrax Stockcar Racingaposs Facebook page: Last night was horric, badly organised, half of the event didn’t even happen, no monster truck as advertised, the apos£, firework spectacularapos was far from it, staff were rude and swearing in front of kids, yet to see a race take place.The commentator did his best to build excitement at what can only be considered a disaster but the odds were against him. Waste of time and money. And a woman wrote: My family go often to watch the racing here and itaposs been amazing! Tonight was appalling. Total embarrassment to the sport. Poor kids are gutted. No monster trucks and not much racing. I feel sorry for the drivers too. The staff stewards attitude was beyond ignorant and rude. Nowhere to stand, the younger kids couldnapost see.

A new graphic by the Northern Agenda shows how transformational the rail lines could be for northerners as it makes vast swathes of the country more accessible by rail than by car. It shows how,delivered in full, the projects would make huge areas of the North West, Midlands, South East and even South-West more accessible to northerners. Black dots show areas that are quicker by train, and orange show those quicker by car. In the before picture, it is only quicker to get from Leeds to parts of London and the South-East, Edinburgh, and some areas close by in the north, not including Manchester or Liverpool. However, in the after picture, the dference is stark as all of the South East and London is quicker by train.  Added to that, the West Midlands is too, as the HS line would connect via Birmingham to the north. Even further afield in the South West, Bristol and Wales becomes far easier for people to get to. The graphic is based on data by Tom Forth, Head of Data at Open Innovations, who demonstrated it was quicker to go by car rather than train, from Leeds to almost anywhere  in the north.  The graphic comes ahead of the government’s Integrated Rail Plan which is due in the coming days. It will outline how these two schemes fit in with other rail and infrastructure schemes.It is unknown whether Boris Johnson will see both schemes through in full. Reports suggest Rishi Sunak is pushing for a cheaper version of both projects which would gut its connectivity. HS is a project that would see a new rail line built, this is signicant as it would allow high-speed trains to pass along it, freeing them up from other lines. When a high-speed train is on a rail line, its way must be cleared, meaning fewer other trains can run. However, the infrastructure project would free up other lines. Combined with the Northern Powerhouse Rail, which would look to directly connect northern cities, the two would dramatically increase connectivity and accessibility in the north.

Louise is the daughter of Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex and the youngest granddaughter of the Queen and the late Prince Philip.She is currently studying for her A-levels with her mum keen for her to go on to university. But some royal experts believe she could play a key role in the Firm going forward and won over many royal fans with her moving words about her late grandfather earlier this year.  Here we look at how she is becoming, as one royal expert put it, precisely the kind of person the Queen can rely on. Growing up Louise, who officially becomes an adult today and is th in line to the throne, was born prematurely in November . She was born after mum Sophie suffered a placental abruption and was rushed to hospital. Her dad Edward was not present at her birth as she arrived early when he was on an official visit to Mauritius.

The family live in Bagshot Park, just a few miles from Windsor Castle, and Louise was joined by a younger brother, James, Viscount Severn in .Her first major royal appearance came aged seven when she was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her older cousin Prince William to the Duchess of Cambridge in .She also accompanied her parents on a tour of South Africa in  but public appearances as a child were few and far between. aposFavourite grandchildaposEven though she largely grew up out of the spotlight, Louise has a very close relationship with the Queen and the late Prince Philip. She and her brother James are said to have spent a lot of time with their grandparents due to living close to Windsor and being around at a time when Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh had largely stopped travelling internationally. In fact, growing up, Louise had no concept that her grandmother and the Queen were the same person.Mum Sophie once said: I mean Louise had no concept really that the Queen and her grandmother were one and the same person. “It wasn’t until she was at school that other children were mentioning it and saying, ‘Your gran is the Queen’.Sources have said the Queen and Philip were particularly fond of Louise due to their shared love for the outdoors. An insider previously told the Sun: The Queen loves the fact that Louise and James relish their time at Balmoral, and she has become particularly close to Louise, who seems to have become her favourite grandchild, closely followed by James. Meanwhile, Louise also took up her late grandfatheraposs favourite sport of carriage driving, and recently spoke about they bonded over their love of the hobby. Speaking on the documentary Prince Philip: The Family Remembers, she said: The Duke of Edinburgh has been so involved in my driving, but itaposs slightly scary as he invented the sport pretty much. But itaposs incredible to have learned first-hand from him and it definitely made us closer I think. Family fans But it isnapost just the Queen that Louise has endeared herself to - other royals were also said to be impressed by her during their get-togethers at Balmoral.She is said to have helped out Kate and William by looking after their children while at the Highland estate, and even sat patiently with Princess Charlotte - helping her to draw pictures of the wildle.A source previously told the Sun: Because of her obvious artistic skill, the Queen allowed Louise to look through some of the collection of Queen Victoria’s Highlands sketches which are kept at Balmoral but are rarely dug out these days.Public debut  Now, itaposs not just her family who think highly of the -year-old - Louise won over new fans during her public speaking debut in September.In the documentary Prince Philip: The Family Remembers, Louise spoke fondly and movingly about her late grandfather.Sharing her experiences of taking part in the Duke of Edinburghaposs Award scheme, she said: Iaposd always wanted to do it because of the skills that you develop as a result. But there was certainly an element of making my grandfather proud and honouring him by taking part in the award that has been so much of his leaposs work. And I definitely hope that I have made him proud. Viewers were touched by Louiseaposs comments and one took to Twitter writing: I thought the star of this programme was easily Lady Louise. What a lovely girl she is.Another said: Wow how good was it to see Lady Louise Windsor in her first documentary. While another added: Lady Louise has such fabulous memories of her grandfather, it was a beautul interview and they must miss him very much. Title and royal work Now sheaposs turned , Louise will now have a big decision to make - and it regards her title. When she and her younger brother James were born, their parents decided against them using their HRH titles. However, mum Sophie revealed in an interview last year they do indeed have the titles, and it will be up to them when they turn they want to use them.Speaking to the Sunday Times, Sophie said: We try to bring them up with the understanding they are very likely to have to work for a living.“Hence we made the decision not to use HRH titles. They have them and can decide to use them from , but I think it’s highly unlikely.”  But despite Sophie saying itaposs unlikely Louise will use her title, some experts believe she could be an asset to the royals.Expert Phil Dampier told theLouise could be a secret weapon adding: She seems to be very mature for her age and she’s shaping up to be precisely the kind of person the Queen can rely on in the future. Could there be a role for her in a slimmed-down monarchy  The Queen and Philip had , patronages between them.“You have to ask yourself who is going to continue their legacy with Harry and Meghan and Prince Andrew off the scene  There’s a huge workload there.”While another expert, Richard Fitzwilliam, previously told the Express : Lady Louise has kept a rather charming but low profile.With the number of working royals now fewer and most being from the older generation until George, Charlotte and Louis are able to take on royal duties, there may well be charitable ventures she may wish to support in future years and from that may follow occasional royal engagements. Immediate future  However, now sheaposs turned , itaposs unlikely that Louiseaposs role in the royal family will change quickly.She currently attends a private school in Ascot, where she is studying for her A-levels. And it seems her mum is hoping she will attend university, saying: I wouldn’t force her, butshe wants to. She’s quite clever.She also told BBC Radio : I would hope that she can go on with her studies, which I think she probably will want to do, and I hope that she and her friends will protect her from anything that somebody might want to do.But I have to let her live her le. Itaposs not mine to live. I can only equip her the best that I can, and then she has to make her own choices. “But I hope for the next few years, at least, she will still be able to be as private as she wants to be.And in the same interview, Sophie also revealed how Louise has shunned social media and added: I wouldnapost deny her going onto it. But sheaposs not really that interested in it.“There are a few s that she talks to her friends on. But thataposs basically it. She doesnapost put anything out about herself at all. Sheaposs very private. Sheaposs got her eyes fairly wide open.

Jonathan Jones, , was first diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour at the tender age of . And after surviving over  rounds of chemotherapy to keep the tumour at bay, Jonathan was believed to never be able to father a child and had even frozen his sperm as a teen as a precaution. Now Jonathan and his loving partner Danielle Taylor, , who he met in a bar in Birmingham in , are the proud parents of their young baby, JJ.  Danielle said: When he told me about the brain tumour he thought Iaposd be put off. It just made me want to get to know him even more. I just thought aposWhat an amazing guy.apos That was it for me. Heaposs just one in a million. Despite being told he may never father children and freezing his sperm when just a teen, he recently welcomed his first child after less than a year and without the help of IVF. Jonathan said: Iaposd always wanted to be a dad, but I didnapost think I would ever have a child as I have had over  rounds of chemo JJ is an absolute miracle and was conceived naturally, although we were looking into IVF. I really think my story will inspire other people to remain strong and hopeful. Jonathan remembers the stress of his school days, with poor behaviour always holding him back. Looking back now, he believes it may have been the brain tumour growing and changing his personality even at the age of five or six.  His mum mum, Alison Keen, , was convinced there was more to her sonaposs unruly behaviour than just ADHD. Alison tried it all - from trying to section his son at The Priory, a mental health care facility, even attempting to go on the now cancelled Jeremy Kyle show, which Jonathon refused in the end. It all seemed lost until Jonathanaposs mum took him back to the doctors at the end of July  and demanded a brain scan. And within the hour, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour that was the size of an orange.  His mum was even told had the tumour been left for another two weeks Jonathan would have died. Immediately he was rushed into surgery at University Hospital Coventry where % of the growth was removed and was diagnosed to be a cancerous Oligodendroglioma. Doctors told him he would need chemo for the rest of his le to keep the tumour at bay and he has been on chemo drugs ever since - with  his th year of treatment. He is now on four-weekly cycles, to be extended to six-weekly as he gets older. Worried about his fertility, Jonathan also had his sperm frozen when he was diagnosed in case he wanted to become a dad at a later date. Cancer treatment can slow or stop sperm production altogether and some men become permanently infertile. He married in his s and was with that partner for ten years, but they split up and Jonathan met Danielle in a bar in Birmingham in . It was instant, Jonathan said. Iaposd given up on meeting people. She was dferent.  The couple suffered an unplanned pregnancy after five months and were gutted to miscarry, so planned to do IVF after consulting with their GP.But they conceived naturally again after six months. The result is their son JJ, born on May  this year. Now the couple is gearing up and ready for another baby together to add to their ever-growing miracle family. Jonathan said: With JJ and Danielle, my le aside from the chemo is perfect. JJ is such a blessing.

The -year-old presenter, and co-host Phillip Schofield were speaking to in-house vet Dr Scott Miller about the launch of the first pet-centric TV channel in the UK, DOGTV. Phil, Holly and Scott were all cuddling the dogs on set as Holly asked: “Separation anxiety is a real problem for many people and their pets at the moment. Will something like this be the answer ”At which point the dog she was holding, a red shaggy dog called Ned, became extremely interested in DOGTV playing on the screen opposite, and managed to pull Holly straight off the sofa onto a yellow bean bag on the floor, the Liverpool Echo reports.  She called out: “Ned, Ned, come back.” But the dog was just too strong for her to hold as Phillip Schofield burst into laughter. Just as she’d recovered, Ned lunged forwards again dragging her further across the set as she giggled to herself. Dr Scott Miller described DOGTV as ‘dog Gogglebox’ as Ned got himself comfortable on Holly’s lap, despite being nearly as big as her.This week our sister site TeamDogs is hosting its first ever Hero Dogs Week, supported by Everypaw Pet Insurance.Aiming to shine a light on the UK’s incredible furry friends, this week-long celebration will spotlight the everyday heroes who’ve gone above and beyond to help their humans – but we need your help finding them.

Mr Parke said: “Giving people the option to display their pronouns at work is really important as it encourages them to show allyship towards trans and non-binary colleagues. “Many of us already include our pronouns in our email signatures, but when you’re talking to people in person it’s useful to know how they want to be referred to in order to help everyone feel comfortable and avoid any misgendering. “Right now trans people in the UK are facing more abuse and discrimination than ever before, and so it’s up to all of us to create an inclusive culture and make sure everyone gets the respect they deserve. “It’s great that MS is proactively taking these sorts of steps to support and celebrate LGBTQ+ colleagues.” Sasha Misra, associate director of communications and campaigns at Stonewall, said: “It’s great to see an increasing number of businesses offering the option of badges with pronouns for staff. “Creating an inclusive workplace starts with everyday actions, and having pronouns on badges is a simple yet impactful way to make sure LGBTQ+ identities are respected – for employees and customers alike.” Comment MORE ON Marks  Spencer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Linzie Mathieson, from Kingswells in Aberdeen, was rushed to hospital when her waters broke at  weeks and she was put on antibiotics to prevent infection before being sent home to rest.When she went into labour in August this year she was warned her sons Alfie and Harry were unlikely to survive after they were delivered by emergency C-section, the Daily Record reports. She said the boys were delivered and whisked away to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where they were worked on for a few hours to stabilise them. Both were placed on ventilators and Harry was given Nitric. At this point, Linzie was told that the next  hours would be critical. Poor Harryaposs lungs were underdeveloped and he needed a lot of help in the first few weeks of his le. Alfie came off the ventilator before his brother but had to be put back on a week later as the pair fought hard and battled every hurdle in their way. The boys have since spent eight weeks in intensive care and four weeks in high dependency after their birth.  They are now receiving treatment on a specialist care ward but due to improvements Linzie hopes to welcome them home soon. She said: “They are both still on oxygen and both have surgery this coming week. They have both done so well and have piled on weight and are taking bottle feeds.

Chloe Fewster was whisked away from her family home in Hull by her controlling boyfriend on Christmas day last year and taken to an address in Scunthorpe. She was kept here for three weeks, until she managed to escape him. As her ex-partner was locked up this week for assaulting her, Chloe, , has spoken out to warn other women about her abusive ex, who she thought would end up killing her. Chloe said her partner, Allan MacGilvray, hit her with a meat cleaver and smashed up her phone to keep her from contacting loved ones.I went through three weeks of constant daily physical abuse, I was scared like I had never been scared before,” she toldHull Live . At times I thought he was going to kill me.”She got together with MacGilvray in November , around the time he was accused of raping and attacking another woman, which she didnapost know about at the time. He has since been cleared of rape, but convicted of assault.  Chloe said he was nice for a couple of weeks, before showing his true colours. Over Christmas , Chloe was at her mumaposs house when MacGilvray, , turned up and dragged her out of the shower when she didnapost answer her phone to him, before taking her against her will to an address in Scunthorpe. The pair were homeless and sleeping between ious houses belonging to his friends, before seeking help from a homeless organisation, Nomad. But he made her leave after they asked too many personal questions and he was worried he was going to get reported to the police, who were looking for him for the rape charge, and Chloe, after she was reported missing. In that time he regularly beat Chloe, including inflicting cuts on her head, face and ears with a meat cleaver.Meanwhile her desperate family were putting out appeals for information on social mediaabout her and fearing she was dead.  Chloe was eventually found by police in Lincoln city centre, black and blue, after the drug Spice had left MacGilvray unable to walk and she fled from him. She had used her card which led police straight to her. But terried Chloe wouldnaposthome until MacGilvray was found and arrested a few days later. She said: Police finally found me in Lincoln, black and blue, with marks in my head from a meat cleaver. Iaposd had a kne dug in my ribs and held to my throat. He put a pillow over my face and strangled me from behind like a choke-hold and made me pass out. There’s so much more that he did to me, as well as smashing up my stuff. He smashed up my phone so I couldnapost call anyone. I couldn’t even go to the toilet on my own, he didn’t trust me to do that without being paranoid that I was going to make an escape. He smashed up my make-up because I was taking ages to put it on, as he forced me to wear make-up every day to cover up the black eyes he gave me.  When I was missing he was on my social media pretending to be me, making me send a photo to friends and family to show I was ‘fine’. The phone I was using was a woman’s who he knew as heaposd smashed mine already. MacGilvray has since been jailed for three years at Bradford Crown Court, after being convicted of assaulting a woman causing actual bodily harm, between November  and  last year, in relation to the other victim. He was cleared by the jury at Hull Crown Court of raping her. He admitted causing actual bodily harm and criminal damage in relation to Chloeaposs ordeal. The sentence relating to Chloeaposs treatment by him amounted to just one year. Chloe, who is currently unable to work due to the trauma sheaposs suffered, said she feels angry and doesn’t think that justice has been served. She feels depressed and isolated, and says she has developed trust issues as result of how she was treated. He got one year for me because he pleaded guilty. After everything that I went through, getting brayed every day and wonderinghe’s going to end up killing me as things were getting worse every day, what was even the point  This isnapost justice at all,” she said. Chloe is now trying to rebuild her le now, and said she doesnapost want it to be overshadowed by what he did. But she says she wants other women to know what MacGilvray is like and what he is capable of. Chloeaposs mum, Kerry McDougall said she would like to thank the police for getting her daughter back to her and wants to warn others about his vile actions. She said: When Chloe was missing I had messages off other women, it must have been four or five women who had been previous victims of Allan MacGilvray. They were reaching out warning me about this manaposs history, and their stories were horrendous. I started to worry that he may go too far this time and it will be my daughter he ends up killing. I couldnapost get my head round how he was still able to walk the streets. I had three weeks of constant worry and wondering what was happening to her, not knowingshe was still in Hull or not. I knew something was seriously wrong. When the police found her she was in Lincoln, she had black eyes, bruised ears, and face, and cuts in her head where he had hit her with a meat cleaver. She was still very scared and wouldnapost come home until she knew he had been put on remand. Twelve months in prison for keeping someone against their will and physically abusing them everyday for three weeks is shocking. Especially with his long list of previous convictions for similar offences. Recorder Ben Nolan QC, who jailed him this week, branded MacGilvray a highly unpredictable, volatile, controlling and dangerous man.

Hours early, and on board BA’s flight, there was a chorus of applause as it, and Virgin Atlantic’s jet took to the skies together in a first for two commercial services.You could also hear the palpable sigh of relief from the airline bigwigs present that this moment had arrived, and with it their hope will make a fightback from what has driven other competitors to the wall.  It is also important for those businesses that can finally meet others face-to-face. And it is a big day for tourism chiefs in the Big Apple banking on aof the big spending British shoppers. But yesterday was never really about the firms involved, it was about the iniduals on board - and those who have rushed to book flights - counting down the hours, the day the weeks until they can embrace precious loved ones again.

Kushnahar Islam,  and her daughter Nicola Islam, , travelled from Kent to meet sister Aisha Methew, , her husband Vincent Methew and their two kids Adam and Aaron. It was the first time Mrs Islam had met the youngest grandchild, Aaron. Aisha, from New Jersey, said: “It’s been eighteen months but it feels like it has been  years.  “It is so wonderful to be back together. “It feels so surreal that we are finally here. “We are just so happy.” The first British Airways flight - and another by Virgin Atlantic - took off simultaneously from dferent runways at Heathrow Airport in what is believed to be a first. The flights, and a fleet of others that jetted off from the UK to other US destinations, marked what travel bosses are hoping is a milestone in its long journey back to recovery from the Covid crisis.  Yesterday’s change to US entry requirements follows the UK Government’s decision in the summer to lt quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated US customers when travelling to Britain. In ,  million people travelled between the two countries, along with , tonnes of cargo. The same year saw £.billion spent by Brits travelling to and in the US, and vice versa. While today signalled the lting of the ban, only double vaccinated passengers are being allowed in.  Another of those counting down the days to yesterday was Maria Butter, , who finally meet up with best pal Mario after  years apart. The pair grew up together in their native Columbia, and Maria, who now lives in Manchester, was due to fly to Mario’s wedding in spring , when the pandemic saw the US impose a ban on UK nationals arriving. “Despite being apart for so long, we were so close,” Mrs Butter, a Spanish teacher told the Mirror. “He is like an uncle to my daughter. “Not being at his wedding was so upsetting. “During the pandemic you realised who was important to you.  Christian Marcelia, , said he was “excited and a bit nervous” to fly to New York to visit his girlfriend. He said: “My girlfriend lives over there, so we’ve been sort of long distance for two years. “I’m going there to meet her family for the first time.” They have been a couple for nearly two years, he said, spending most of that time on dferent continents due to pandemic-induced travel restrictions.“  Phil Drummond, , was on one of the last flights to leave the US before the ban came into force in March last year - and was on the first possible flight back to meet his sister Bobbe . During that time his brother-in-law in the US contracted Covid-, and thankfully recovered. “She would have come to us last Christmas but obviously that couldn’t happen,” he said. “It’s just brilliant to finally get to see her again.” Bobbe were there to greet him, along with her six year old son Ben, who was holding a colourful “Welcome Back Uncle Phil” hand written sign he had made and a red big apple balloon.  “It is so, so strange,” she said. “It is surreal. “In some ways it’s like I only saw him yesterday.” The ban on Brits has devastated many airlines, but few more so than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic which relied heavily on the lucrative transatlantic routes. Sean Doyle, BA chief executive, said yesterday: “We have been hibernating for a lot longer than any of us feared when the pandemic started, so it is great to have an important milestone today. “The emotional toll of the pandemic has been huge, but so has the toll on business. “The amount of business done between the two countries is huge. “You need to get in front of people to build relationships and build economic activity.” Travellers to the US still need to conduct costly Covid tests before arrival. Mr Doyle backed calls for the testing to be ditched. “The evidence we have seen in Europe where double vaccinated travellers don’t have to do testing is…no dferent to what we are seeing,” he said. “With the vaccine programmes I would say we shouldn’t have testing for fully vaccinated passengers.” The BA flight was also billed as its greenest ever for long-haul , and the first directly powered by sustainable aviation fuel. With the focus still on the out of the COP climate summit in Glasgow, some % of the jet fuel used came recycled cooking oil. BA is % of its jet fuel to come from less environmentally damaging sources by .

But it has ided some film fans and royal experts, with some calling the accuracy of some of the scenes into question - even though the director described the film as a fable from a true tragedy rather than a biopic.However, one of the more bizarre scenes in the movie sees Dianaaposs character being weighed on her arrival at Sandringham. But having to stand on the scales both on arrival and departure from Sandringham is apparently something the royals actually do. Royal expert Ingrid Seward once told Grazia the Queen ensures that the guests weigh themselves on a pair of antique scales in a tradition that dates back to Edward VII.Edward wanted to ensure his guests were fed well and any visitors to Sandringham were required to sit on the device and be weighed upon arrival and departure to seethey had put on pounds during their stay. However itaposs unclearitaposs something the royals still do today, oritaposs something to stay in the history books. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.But regardless of whether they monitor it or not, thereaposs a good chance they might put on a bit of weight given the lavish food available for the royals to eat - especially on Christmas Day. Darren McGrady, who used to work in the royal kitchens, has previously said: After church, thataposs when they have a big lunch that includes a salad with shrimp or lobster, and a roasted turkey, and all of your traditional side dishes like parsnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. They stick with the same meal year after year. Later they are said to enjoy tea and cake before tucking into a candlelit dinner later that evening.This year, the Queen is said to be “totally committed” to entertaining her loved ones at her Norfolk home this Christmas after missing out last year because of the pandemic. She is currently in the middle of a period of rest and is not set to undertake any public engagements until at least the weekend for the annual Remembrance Sunday service.Last year restrictions meant the Queen and the late Prince Philip had a quiet Christmas alone at Windsor Castle.But after losing her husband of  years in April, it is understood Her Majesty really wants to see everyone together. A Palace insider said: “This year, more than ever, it is incredibly important to Her Majesty to be surrounded by her loved ones. “The Queen is totally committed to hosting everyone as she hopes to make it back to full health in the coming weeks. “Her Majesty is resting under doctors’ orders with the intention of being able to fully enjoy the company of her extended family over the holiday period. “After being forced to cancel a host of engagements, the family get-together will be the perfect tonic.” Comment MORE ON Princess DianaChristmasRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Anti-hunting campaign group Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs published a clip showing a woman being aggressive towards the animal after it ran into a road. In the footage, she can be seen kicking the horse and then punching the animal before pulling it by the reins into a vehicle. The rider, dressed in cream breeches and a navy jacket, is believed to be part of Cottesmore Hunt, a foxhound pack based in Rutland. The RSPCA - the largest animal welfare charity in the UK - launched an appeal for information after the video was shared on social media at the weekend.  Several people contacted the charity to urge them to investigate the incident.A person tweeted: This is unacceptable!!! That poor horse was hit and kicked. Every day more shocking evidence emerges of the violent cruelty these hunts inflict on innocent animals. Ridiculous that they are allowed to get away with it.One replied: Totally agree with you something seriously need to be done about it no animal should be treated like that. Another person said: As a horsewoman myself, nothing makes me angrier than seeing footage such as this. It is shameful. There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour.  No matter how frustrated you are, no matteryou’ve had a bad day. Horses are so sensitive. What a way to make them head shy. Following the incident, Cottesmore Hunt reportedly said it did not condone the actions shown in the video under any circumstances.The Hunting Office condemned the actions of the woman, saying she is not a member of the hunting associations. The RSPCA said in a statement: This footage is really upsetting. We will always look into complaints made to us about animal welfare. We would urge anyone with first hand information about this incident to contact us on   . A spokesman from the Hunting Office said: The Hunting Office expects the highest level of animal welfare at all times - both on and off the hunting field - and condemns the actions taken by this inidual, who is not a member of the hunting associations. The Mirror has contacted Cottesmore Hunt for comment.

Lee-Joshua Hodgson, three, had groin swelling and a cough when his parents took him to a GP in March last year. He was then taken to hospital, but sent home with antibiotics after doctors decided the odd ailments were caused by a virus, Liverpool Echo reports.Some months later dad Josh found a lump on the back of the toddleraposs knee when he fell over. Doctors initially thought it was a cyst and booked the youngster in for scans in December.The family were sent home on Christmas Eve with the belief all would be okay. But a further scan ruptured the familyaposs le when it showed an extremely rare and aggressive form of terminal cancer.  The cancer - which is called a metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma alveolar - is usually found in the bodyaposs soft tissues.On Boxing Day the youngster underwent major surgery to remove a tumour latched on to his spine.The growth stopped him walking and the cancer in his bones had also caused his hip to break. The cancer - which is called a metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma alveolar - had spread across his body and the little one was given between just five to  per cent chance of survival. Dad Josh said: He had  rounds of radiotherapy which he had to be put to sleep for and six-months of the most intense chemotherapy.  He responded well to it and then was put on maintenance therapy but he was complaining of pain in his back and head and for a long time nothing seemed to get done. I believe the surgery he had on Boxing Day opened a gateway for the disease to spread to other parts of his body. The family was given more devastating news in October of this year when they found out that the cancer had spread to his brain, with one lesion being close to the brainstem. Doctors told the family the cancer was terminal and they do not know how long the three-year-old has left to live.  Josh added: They told me it is terminal, but thataposs the NHS opinion. From a parents point of view, we believe we will find something and we are still looking.Whilst he is still here fighting, we will keep fighting for him. Heaposs the strongest kid Iaposve ever met in my le. Since his terrible prognosis, heaposs been much better in himself. We were told he wouldnapost walk again but we got him walking ourselves. This is a soft tissue cancer, it will pop up everywhere and anywhere because the whole body is soft tissue so why werenapost the right decisions made and scanning done sooner  A fundraiser was set up earlier in the year to help the family to fund specialist, private treatment abroad.Bringing in more than £,, the family said they were in talks with doctors in Spain to discuss options. Josh said: The one we were waiting for, we were told will no longer work for him and we are just waiting to hear back about another combination of treatments. Heaposs on a type of chemotherapy now on the NHS and they think he will respond well to it. It wonapost cure him, weaposve been told we will lose him to this disease but hopefully it will shrink it. Thereaposs a trial thataposs not available here yet, we havenapost got the time, but hopefully this treatment will give him long enough until this trial pops up. In a bid to help the family through this awful time, Kirkby residents Franny Briggs and Jay Murray decided to sleep on the streets from Friday evening to Sunday morning armed with portable phone charges and sleeping bags. Franny, who is recognised in the community for helping those in need, said: We originally wanted to raise funds to help baby Lee travel for treatment but now thataposs not possible as his cancer is too far gone. So this money is to make the family more comfortable with the time they have left. Weaposve done all kinds to raise money but this time we wanted to do something dferent so decided to sleep rough. We didnapost leave the town centre at all and relied on donations given to us on the day, we only had our phones to keep an eye on the fundraising. We raised £, which is great. It was was very cold but we battled on and we had lots of food from local shops and businesses, so we shared that with the real homeless that were there. Anyone wishing to donate can still do so online. Josh added: Franny and Jay said the money was to spend on memories, whatever we decided as a family. Itaposs fantastic, unbelievable what they did. They are brilliant in what they do for the community. Iaposve never even met them before and what theyaposve done for us is crazy. We have that many people to thank but we would like to thank everyone for their support. A gang of kids did a car wash aged three and four and raised £ which was touching, itaposs kids helping kids. The whole community is rallying together. Even people in Huyton. As fantastic as it is. money wonapost change the look on my face but hopefully it will do something when something does pop up.

A group that scours derelict buildings around Scotland shared pictures online of the factory - but they have not revealed the exact location.Images show huge piles of dried-up plant cuttings in the attic, as well as rows of bags of soil, the Daily Record reports.The bar area still has tables laid out with drinks and cutlery, as well as an untouched wedding cake on display. Half-empty bottles of spirits remain on the bar alongside unopened packets of crisps, while boxes of fertiliser are stacked in the back.  The explorer posted images of the “abandoned weed pub” to a social media group with more than , members. They wrote: “When drink runs out, let’s get high.” Despite several requests by social media users to find out where the pictures were taken, the explorer refused to give out the location. Urban exploring has become massive with more and more bloggers posting on YouTube and social media.  But the pastime has prompted debates on the legalities of accessing private property and appeals from emergency services over safety issues.Over summer, an urban explorer digging through a creepy abandoned house in the Scottish Highlands uncovered the mummied remains of a cat in the kitchen.The empty family home was described as being frozen in time by YouTuber Adam Mark Explores , in a clip that sees him take his k subscribers on a tour of the decaying building. Upon entering the house, Adam described the “dark and eerie” atmosphere, as well as a silence which he said put him on edge as he made his way through.  The video showed the rotting house scattered with old books, magazines and newspapers, dated between the s and s. Speaking over the eerie footage, which panned through the dferent rooms of the house, Adam described the thick layer of dust that coated the furniture and the decayed antique dolls. Most of the windows were stained glass which looked amazing with the sun beaming through projecting the colours into the rooms,” Adam said. Scenes from within the house included a dining room table, covered in dirt but miraculously still set with plates and cutlery.

The UK is seeing hotter temperatures and heavier rain, while illnesses and conditions caused by long-term air pollution exposure are ravaging the population. Average global temperatures have risen by more than °C since the s, and , , , ,  and  were the hottest years ever recorded. Unless we drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are likely to see °C further of warming, with the planet set to have heated up by a whopping °C at the end of this century. Those of us living in the west are luckier - climate change is affecting developing countries far worse, and they have fewer resources to tackle it. But that doesnapost mean we arenapost seeing the effects already, every single day.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Shrinking humans  Changes in the temperature of the planet are thought to be affecting the size and weight of humans, because being smaller helps you survive better in hot climates. And °C of global warming reduces the weight of somebody weighing . stone by .lbs on average, a study suggested. Researchers at Cambridge University discovered that human body sizes y depending on the temperatures they live in. Colder, harsher climates make the average body size bigger, while warmer temperatures shrink it - and this is thought to be because bigger bodies retain more heat, while being smaller allows a human to cool down and release more heat. Professor Andrea Manica, who worked on the study, explained: Our study indicates that climate – particularly temperature – has been the main driver of changes in body size for the past million years. We can see from people living today that those in warmer climates tend to be smaller, and those living in colder climates tend to be bigger. But scientists add that itaposs hard to say how much of a part other factors such as advancements in medicine and nutrition have played in the changes in our body size. Wild weather - unbearable heat and flash floodsOne effect of climate change we are already seeing even in the UK is more extreme weather conditions.The UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, with worrying events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall becoming much more frequent. This means we will be more susceptible to flash flooding, which can force people out of their homes and destroy their houses and livelihoods. Whataposs more, the highest temperature in European history appears to have hit Sicily last month, reported to be .C. And our infrastructure isnapost ready for much more rain, with bridges and sewers under immense pressure to manage enormous amounts of water, facing collapse. Nearly four in  peoplelive within  kilometres from a shoreline and are at risk of floodingsea levels continue to rise, says the Met Office. Last year was one of the UKaposs warmest and sunniest but also wettest on record - with figures going back more than  years.  A Royal Meteorological Society report found  was the third warmest, fth wettest and eighth sunniest on record, making it the first year that has been in the all-time top  for all three. Mike Kendon, senior climate scientist at the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, who worked on the study, said: The UK’s climate is already changing.The warming that we see is broadly consistent with what we see globally... and our climate seems to be getting wetter as well as warmer, and that’s consistent with our broad understanding of the process [of climate change]. Richard Allan, professor of climate science at Reading University, added: Very wet periods and associated flooding are becoming more severe as higher greenhouse gas levels warm the air, increasing the moisture that fuels storms. A more thirsty atmosphere also dries the ground more effectively, intensying the already hotter spells and making our weather more extreme. Wildfires Climate change has been a key factor in the terrying increase in wildfires around the world, as drier, hotter land causes fires to spread further and faster. Last year, Calornia saw its worst fire season since records began, while the Amazon rainforest experienced its third-largest fire of all time. Fires hit many other countries including Indonesia, North American, Siberia and Australia - which saw  people killed and  million acres of land destroyed in a weeks-long blaze in .Greg Mullins, Australiaaposs fire commissioner-turned climate change campaigner told: Itaposs going to be a very, very dangerous place to live – not Australia, planet Earth.Iaposm deeply worried about my grandsons and what theyaposre inheriting from us. He added: The whole world is burning at the same time... We need to take action on emissions.And itaposs a vicious cycle, as wildfires are thought to be a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions - and are also responsible for -% of the . million annual premature deaths from poor air quality, according to researchers.Illness, deaths, and more pandemics Heatwaves are currently the number one weather-related cause of death, and between  and , climate change is expected to cause approximately , additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress, says the World Health Organisation.High air temperatures contribute directly to deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory disease, particularly among elderly people, says the WHO. And high temperatures also raise the levels of ozone and other pollutants in the air that exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Pollen and other aeroallergen levels are higher in extreme heat - which can trigger asthma attacks. When temperatures are above °C for two or more days, it can trigger a public health warning - and this could happen four times a year in the s, itaposs predicted -  times more often than in the s.Itaposs thought outbreaks of the West Nile virus has correlated with higher temperatures, according to the UK Centre for Ecology  Hydrology. And the mosquito-borne illness, which can cause serious neurological disease, is more likely to sweep through the UK in the next - years due to climate change.Higher temperatures can also increase many food and water-borne illnesses transmitted through insects, snails and other cold-blooded animals, with malaria rates believed to rise with the temperature. Heavy rainfall also tends to make the rat population explode in numbers, as seen in Pamana in , sparking an outbreak of a fatal lung disease.Droughts, heatwaves and extreme rain are also already affecting food prices and availability, while their transportation systems could also be damaged, potentially changing the types of food we are able to access in this country and thus our nutrition. Air pollution is the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK, with between , and , deaths a year attributed to long-term exposure. There is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, and exacerbates asthma.Moreover, illnesses like Covid- are likely to spread again and just as fast, because coronaviruses and other respiratory illnesses believed to have come from bats and birds are skyrocketing.And with their natural habitats being destroyed, animals hosting the viruses are moving closer and closer to humans - opening the door to more pandemics. Christine Johnson, associate director of the One Health Institute at the University of Calornia, warns: Almost every major epidemic we know of over the past couple of decades — SARS, COVID-, Ebola and Nipah virus - jumped to people from wildle enduring extreme climate and habitat strain.

The “friend” who thinks knowing us insulates them from the charge of racism when they are being just that. Ex-England cricketer Gary Ballance admitted in a statement last week he’d called Yorkshire teammate, Azeem Rafiq, a “P***” – but said it was done “in the spirit of friendly banter” . Ballance has come clean because, in August , Rafiq gave an interview in which he spoke about the racism he experienced at Yorkshire, including an “openly racist” captain and a dressing room in which racist comments were seen as humorous. The club effectively stuck its head in the sand, but an independent report has blown the whole thing wide open. Sponsors have withdrawn their cash, chairman Roger Hutton has resigned and English cricket’s most successful county has been banned from hosting internationals.  But back to Ballance. He claims to be incredulous that calling an Asian person the P-word could cause the kind of hurt and anguish it did to Rafiq. “If I’d believed it, I would have stopped immediately,” said Ballance. “He was my best cricket mate and I cared deeply for him.” Just not enough to stop using this horrendous racist slur against him. It is easy to believe this is a story just about Yorkshire, cricket or even sport. It isn’t. Go into any office, factory, shop floor or football club you like and you’ll find at least one dinosaur convinced that racist abuse can be used as a term of affection. ‘Can a racist term ever be defined as banter ’ trilled the Twitter account of the BBC’s Question Time. Yes, really. It may as well have asked whether slapping your partner is ever justied. Or whether political corruption is ever justiedthe money is for a good cause.  If ever we needed a snapshot of the institutional racism that infects this country to its core, the past week has provided it. Ironically, there is more outrage and anger directed at those who call it out - as Rafiq has found to his cost - than at the issue itself. Yet the fact remains, across any number of industries and sports, iniduals like him iniably find themselves one of the only Black or Asian people in the room at the mercy of the bigots. Across the country you’ll find iniduals pulling the emergency ripcord defence that their workmate, best friend, neighbour, partner, even husband or we is black. Asthat allows them a free pass to use the kind of language or go down the routes that would otherwise see them vilied. The Government does it even now. Prime Minister Boris Johnson surrounds himself with gatekeepers such as Kwasi Kwarteng, Kemi Badenoch and Priti Patel, believing it protects him from stick for describing Burqa-wearing women as looking like letterboxes. Or describing black people as ‘picaninnies’. Question Time is no exception. Presumably pointing to whatever black or Asian members it has on its production team. And no, it is no defence that the offensive question tweeted was one posed by an audience member to spark debate. Rafiq’s forthcoming appearance in front of a parliamentary select committee may well bring the rest of Yorkshire’s house of cards down. But the shock waves are already reverberating way beyond cricket. PS: You’re not someone’s friendyou’re using racist language towards them.

Forensics officers have now been seen taking dozens of evidence bags from the house with items including Bratz dolls and boxes of pens, crayons, crafts and childrenaposs clothes.Kelly is allegedly obsessed with dolls and local sites in Australia first pictured Kelly holding Bratz dolls while wearing a t-shirt that says aposBratzapos on it.Since Kellyaposs arrest, a number of fake Facebook accounts believed to be used by him have emerged. He allegedly created fake social media profiles with photos of his doll collection. When questioned over Kellyaposs alleged obsession with dolls and whether he may have used them to lure Cleo, police said they would not comment. On Friday the stateaposs Justice Department said suspect Kelly was flown to a maximum-security prison in Perth. The developments come as the Aboriginal elder who raised Kelly called him a gt from God and a “beautul little boy”.

Kelly was just two years old when his mother was said to have given him over to Ms Walker in , who then raised him as her own. “I looked down at him and this little boy - God was giving me something back into my le what the welfare took off me - my children,” said Ms Walker, who died in . “His mum didnapost want him and she threw him away.” Kelly reportedly lived alone at Ms Walkeraposs dilapidated Tomkin Crescent duplex home in Carnarvon, Western Australia, after she died last year, aged .

Veronika Rajekaposs social media profile are regularly reported as being fake, she has claimed. The -year-old believes that aposle is harder for beautul people and that she so hot people just think Iaposm fake. Others allegedly bully the former Miss Slovakia  finalist for having had plastic surgery, which she insists isnapost true. People don’t even believe I exist, Veronika said. It’s pretty discriminatory that other women can do the same thing as me and I can’t, and I just get deleted because of my looks.  I call myself an alien as people don’t believe I’m real. They think I’m an AI robot or a catfish online. People say beautul people have it easy but I have it worse as people make it harder for me because I’m beautul.The model, based in Vienna, Austria, travels the world making content for her Instagram – and claims people are always surprised when they meet her for the first time.Veronika claims she receives hundreds of messages from women body shaming her on a regular basis and that many claim she uses filters to advance her looks.  Veronika, who has . million followers on Instagram, said: I get messages from men who donapost think Iaposm real but the worst messages on my Instagram are from women asking me why I’m pretending and asking for proof. I don’t make any adjustments, shaping or filters – I use a skin smoothing tool but I think that’s normal. Skinny girls are body shaming plus-sized models but I’m being body shamed too as they donapost think I’m natural.  I get more abuse from women as they are jealous and they think I want their boyfriend. Only women can hurt other women so strongly. I donapost think I’m perfect but I’m natural in real le, but people are scared of me and donapost want to talk to me. To end the rumours of plastic surgery and claims sheaposs a catfish or robot, Veronika has resorted to desperate measures. She is planning to get a scan of her breasts to prove people wrong. The model paid £ for a breast examination while in Dubai in October, which included a quick scan. She said: I was forced to do this check-up to get people to believe me. People question the naturality of my breasts so I went to a doctor to get a breast examination and proof that they’re real, with no enhancements, objects or scars. My doctor was really surprised as she thought I’d had surgery too and said I had the most beautul natural breasts.  I worked out so much at teenage years that I developed muscles which make my breasts a nice shape. I’m not trying to be sexual, I just have big boobs. God gave me these gts and I want people to believe me. Veronika takes good care of her body - not drinking or partying, instead working out five times a week. But her beauty has also come at a price. She added: ‘I don’t have many friends but I feel good. If you feel beautul the way you are, then you are beautul. If you feel confident in your body and you are plus-sized, then just be confident. “If you have had plastic surgery, just be honest. If you take care of yourself, you can be beautul too.

Paul Millachip, , was swimming in the sea off Western Australia when he was dragged underwater at around am local time on Saturday.

Mr Millachipaposs we Thirl, , said two teenagers on a boat witnessed the attack and tried to help, but could not do anything to save him.  She explained: It came out of the blue. But it did happen, you just have to deal with it. It must have been an absolutely terrying experience for them, so my heart goes out to them. I thank them for what they did. Amazing. They could potentially have saved other lives. Police Acting Inspector Troy Douglas said the teenagers alerted other swimmers and people on the beach, avoiding potential further tragedies. He told ABC News : They have been really, really helpful.

Charlene, , failed toto Monaco to celebrate her th anniversary with her husband in July but said she wasnapost allowed to travel due to a serious ear, nose and throat infection and has since had several surgeries. In August, Albert flew out to South Africa with the coupleaposs children and they posted images of themselves enjoying time as a family on social media. But despite the pictures, French media questioned their relationship, with respected Madame Figaro magazine asking: How long will Albert II of Monaco go on bearing this affront, which is becoming ridiculous Later, both Charlene and Albert vehemently denied the rumours about their marriage, with Albert telling PEOPLE in September: She didnapost leave Monaco in a huff! She didnapost leave because she was mad at me or at anybody . She was going down to South Africa to reassess her Foundationaposs work down there and to take a little time off with her brother and some friends.It was only supposed to be a week-long, -day maximum stay, and [she is still there now] because she had this infection all these medical complications arose. She didnapost go into exile. It was absolutely just a medical problem which had to be treated. While Charlene told a South African TV news channel: Albert is my rock and strength and without his love and support I would not have been able to get through this painful time.  Albert and Charlene met in  - the same year Charlene represented South Africa in the Sydney Olympics in swimming. They married in July  but there were reports before they tied the knot that she tried to leave Monaco andto South Africa. The Palace dismissed the claims as ugly rumours.The couple also spent their first days of the marriage apart with the pair staying in separate hotels in the South African city of Durban - due to Albert attending a meeting of the International Olympic Committee.The palace later said they made up for their time apart on a secret honeymoon - thought to have been in Mozambique. Three years later Charlene gave birth to twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella. In the past, she has spoken about missing her native South Africa.She told Eyewitness News : I am African and this is my heritage. It will always be. It’s in my heart and in my veins.I have the privilege of having this le, but I miss my family and my friends in South Africa and Iaposm often sad because I cannot always be there for them.

make people aware of what will be provided in the future.#No timescale was given as to whether this would be before next May#s elections.In last year#s budget, the service was earmarked for the axe at

trade #Mr Forsyth responded: #It was important for the new route to be established. It was possible to achieve that with a private sector operator taking the risk, which means that CalMac#s available public capital and running costs can be deployed on maintaining other services and introducing new ones.#It must be the right approach to use the state#s nationalised service and the scarce resources available to it as wisely as possible.#That was what lay behind our thinking.#He went on to say that he would write to Mrs Michie regarding the contract.Mrs Michie commented: #It is important we get the full facts about this service so that we can judge whether this really is value for money as the government claims.#FIFTY YEARS AGOEmergency sea rescue services in the Firth of Clyde could have been victims of another hoax on Friday.For the Campbeltown leboat, three naval vessels and a Dakota aircraft spent nearly six hours searching Kilbrannan Sound and its approaches for a boat reported to have been sinking off Campbeltown.The drama began at lunchtime when the Campbeltown leboat mechanic, Mr Alistair Gilchrist, intercepted a wireless message which read: #Mayday Boy Danny sinking  degrees off Campbeltown.#Kildonan Coastguard Station, Troon Leboat Station and Portpatrick Radio also picked up the call the boat#s name, however, was not mentioned in the message received by the other three stations.Then a full-scale search operation swung into operation. Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off.

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

It was the lockdown which entrenched this: screens were the way to connect with people, friends, family and even school learning.They became the default activity and I believe itrsquos become an unhealthy addiction for us and as the nights have drawn in, with less opportunity for outside activity and walks in nature, this addiction has the risk of becoming even worse.I know screens are not all bad, they have benefits and advantages too. . . hell knows, I spend so much time on screens myself.I think we can be too hard on ourselves at times and Irsquom aware of that. Irsquod go to say that some screen time is now important for a iety of reasons. I also recognise that in the last two years they have become a leline for many people.But lately I have been trying my best to practise what I preach as a storyteller. I want to find ways to wean my kids, and myself, from screens to find a healthier balance, a more personal connection which lts our mental health rather than sapping it.Itrsquos not been easy. When the kids are asked to come off screens, they often explode with what I call screen rage. Itrsquos aswe are cutting an umbilical cord and removing their le support system, and they must fight and protest to restore it. The drama is predictable and tiring, but the good news is itrsquos usually relatively short-lived. Irsquove discovered that kids are eventually glad when they have been taken off excessive use of screens.The trick is to have something engaging to replace it with, as well as to model it myself. Thatrsquos the thing, itrsquos so easy to be a hypocrite to tell my kids itrsquos the end of screen time, while using my phone or writing on my laptop.ldquoBut you are still on a screen, dad! was the rebuke from my astute eight-year-old daughter recently. And she was right, so the rules have to apply to me and my we too.We are slowly getting there. We have no screens before bedtime now, instead a family storytelling session. The hardest part has been establishing the routine with so much to do. But now the kids look forward to it and help make the living room cosy in preparation.And I feel the benefits too. It helps me close down that ruminator in my head, which constantly reminds me of how much I have to do, emails I need to reply to, deadlines I need to meet. Instead I become focused on the moment, on the fact Irsquom sharing the attention of my loved ones and we are all telling stories.I know this now does sound overly romantic, but the thing is nothing can compare to these moments of connection, such as the magic of listening to my wee boy tell another spontaneous chapter of his tale of the haunted pizzeria, or listening to my girls weave a story rooted in their experiences of the day or a favoured fable from their earlier childhood. And Irsquove discovered my we Kate is a good storyteller when given the opportunity.Maybe it felt awkward at first, that we were doing it because I thought we should be rather than because we all wanted to. But that awkwardness soon gave way to excited expectation and genuine enjoyment of the experience. And the darkness helps, itrsquos a blanket which adds atmosphere and allows us to use fairy lights and candles, so in that sense the cold and dark of this time of year is a huge advantage: itrsquos the season for cosy storytelling.The flicker of screens still shine more regularly than the storytelling candles in our house. But the balance is slowly changing. Hallowersquoen helped, it seemed such a natural time for storytelling. And I think I can say we have now established our storytelling sessions as a regular family tradition. When it happens, it feels like ancient magic has entered our house.I run storytelling sessions with parents and many share the challenges I recognise in my own family. All families are dferent, of course, and no child is the same. Buta family storytelling tradition can be established, everyone feels the benefits. Evenonly every now and then, they will be times of real connection that everyone will remember.Soyou fancy trying it and would like my short guide with some reflections and tips, drop me an email. Or maybe you have tips and experiences yoursquod like to share recently, a parent told me that bath time was storytelling time in her house, as she sat on the toilet telling favoured tales to her young children!

books on local history and witchcraft, and derives from the report on Spott written by the parish minister for the late th century lsquoOld Statistical Accountrsquo.In his report, the minister John Martin says that the Spott Kirk Session minutes record the referral of Marion Lillie to the civil magistrate in  on a charge of supposed witchcraft and that in  the minutes record: ldquoMany witches burnt at the top of Spott Loan.Mr Martin was, however, wrong.The Spott Kirk Session minutes are exceptionally legible and clear, and they make no reference whatsoever in  to witch burning at Spott Loan or anywhere .Nor is there any mention of Marion Lillie in .However, in , Marion and her son complained to the kirk session that she was being slandered as a witch.A y investigation followed in which it came to light that Marion did indeed have that reputation locally.Since kirk sessions were not qualied to try witchcraft cases, the session passed the matter on to the civil magistrate, as they were required to do.However, there is no evidence of the case being taken any further and the Spott records show that Marion died a natural death in April  and was buried in Spott kirkyard with the usual ceremonial trappings of bell and mortcloth.Unfortunately, many writers on Scottish witchcraft make the mistake of simply repeating what other writers have written, instead of going to the original records to see what was really going on.Poor Marion has thus been slandered in print as an executed witch for over  years, when half an hour spent actually reading the church records of Spott could have revealed the truth.Until recently, a plaque at the Witchesrsquo Stone stated that Marion Lillie was burnt there, but this has now been replaced by one which makes no mention of her.It may well be that the Witchesrsquo Stone marks the execution of a witch, or witches, but the victim was not Marion Lillie, and any such execution was neither in  nor in , which in any case would be

Small beer for them, inflation for the rest of us.GR Weir, Ochiltree.* FORMER Prime Minister Sir John Major says that the current Government in Westminster is behaving in a very \"un-Conservative\" way. I disagree. Itrsquos behaving exactly as I would expect of a Tory government: arrogant and sleazy, with a firm belief that laws and regulations are only for the little people.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.HOLYROOD STANDARDS ARE HIGHERAS parliamentarians are only human, all parties have miscreants but it is how they deal with it that matters, and Richard Allisonfails to acknowledge that Holyrood is vastly superior to Westminster in this regard.Scotlandrsquos standards are higher and much more transparent under the LobbyingAct . In the Scottish Parliament paid advocacy as undertaken by Owen Paterson is a criminal offence and would be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.In the case of Derek Mackay, Mr Allison doesnrsquot seem to know that political parties have no control over what iniduals claim and Mr Mackay left the SNP before being expelled, whereas recently the Tory MP Rob Roberts was allowed back into the Conservatives after sexually harassing a member of staff.Apart from the numerous examples of Tory sleaze and cronyism, we have lost count of the number of times Boris Johnson and co have misled Parliament. The UK Government lied to the Queen to prorogue Parliament, was willing to break international law in a ldquolimited and specic way, forced the PMrsquos own standards chief to quit by overruling him and breached Covid lockdown rules while expecting others to follow them.Outnumbered  to one, Scottish MPs have little or no influence at Westminster and the sooner we get out of that cesspit, the better.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.I DOUBT ANYTHING WILL CHANGEFIRST, can I thank you for publishing two excellent letters on Saturday , from Bob MacDougall and from Richard Allison. I am aware that letters are often referred to as \"excellent\" purely because one agrees with every single thought or statement written in them. Well, yes, in this instance I did, and your first contributor mentioned above finished his letter succinctly and encapsulated todays political situation in the UK: \"The world of politics would surely be a better place without the shilly-shallying Mr Johnson and the isive Nicola Sturgeon.\"As I have often mentioned in your columns, I have the unfortunate situation to stay within the First Ministers constituency ndash a constituency which Ms Sturgeons new bestie, Greta Thunberg, appears to have missed in her tours, and therefore missed the rubbish, the rats, the broken roads and pavements, the tons of litter dropped at random and more.I grew up in Mount Florida, where we had the wonderful local MP Teddy Taylor representing us, and he was what a true MP should be ndash looking after his constituents as best he could. I always remember the story he often told against himself, saying that two of his constituents who lived in Castlemilk were interviewed for a local newspaper, and was asked did they vote Conservative  They laughed and said certainly not, they had always voted Labour, and would continue to vote for the wonderful Teddy Taylor.Sir Teddy, like Sir John Major, would surely dismiss this pathetic apology of a Prime Minister and urge that his toadying party should get rid of him right away. Meanwhile silent SNP ministers sit behind the First Minister every week, and applaud everything she says ndash and thats a lot.I doubt very much that anything will happen soon. After all, we are only the voters, wherever we live.Walter Paul, Glasgow.SNP WILL STRUGGLE IF PM QUITSIF BORIS Johnson resigns because of the Owen Paterson scandal and Rishi Sunak takes over, the nationalists will have lost their greatest asset and will find it dficult to get personal with Mr Sunak.On the other hand, Scottish pro-UK politicians should hang their heads in shameNicola Sturgeon resigns over one of the many scandals swirling around her and they cant lay a glove on Humza Yousaf, John Swinney, Kate Forbes or Angus Robertson, one of whom is her likely successor.It should be like shooting fish in a barrel.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.I HAVE FAITH IN SNP POLITICIANSI NOTE that once again Kevin McKenna has chosen to denigrate First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,  members of the Westminster Parliament and  members of the Scottish Parliament, whom he portrays as money-grubbing iniduals who are only interested in their salaries and pension entitlement . He is of course entitled to his opinion, but as a member of the SNP for more than  years along with tens of thousands of others, I have every faith in the SNP members of both parliaments to hold the Tories at Westminster to account for the manner in which they are ruling over Scotland.Given the current sleaze scandals and dark money swirling around No  and Westminster, it is ludicrous to equate Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Government with the actions of Margaret Thatcher and the Tories in the s.Ms Sturgeon has worked tirelessly over the past  months in dealing with the current Covid pandemic as well as bearing the task of running the country and while no inidual is perfect, she has done this to the best of her ability. This has not been an easy task, bearing in mind  years of Westminster-contrived austerity and the constraints of the devolution settlement.I would ask Mr McKenna: why is it the GMB alone which has been holding Glasgow to ransom at this particular time, when COP is in town, while every other local authority area in Scotland has refuse collectors working normally I write as a past member of two trade unions all my working le and support the refuse collectors in their bid for improved pay and conditions, but there is a whf of cynicism in the way the GMB and the Anas Sarwar have politicised this industrial dispute.Alec Oattes, Ayr.TWO CONTRASTING LEADERSHIP STYLESTHE contrasting leadership styles of the First Minister and the Prime Minister have again been strikingly apparent around COP.During the pandemic the FMrsquos daily public briefings were commonly regarded as a model of good communication and her willingness to take questions from journalists and others an example of how to handle sometimes-dficult scientic detail and to admit its limitations where appropriate.The failure of the public to engage fully with the day-to-day affairs of COP has been partly due to the absence of a clear morning briefing of the programme and its hoped-for outcomes and a further briefing at the end of the day of what has actually been achieved. This surely is part of the role of the chair of the conference.In other walks of le outside politics the FMrsquos acknowledged communication skills would have been utilised to raise the profile and public understanding of the conference to the benefit of the country and wider world.Jim Aitchison, Milngavie.SCOTTISH IS NOW TOXICLAST weekend I attended a superb concert by the Ayrshire Fiddle Orchestra and Dalmellington Brass Band. Catch themyou can. My enjoyment was momentarily lessened by the first bars of a Scottish piece, not because it was not excellent, but with everything \"Scottish\" now appropriated by the separatists, I realised I have become to dislike my own heritage because of the now-toxic association.

Fingers crossed nothing develops later in the day.ldquoGeorge came off having felt a rib in a scrum, which can be uncomfortable, a pretty sharp pain, he added. ldquoBut therersquos been a huge turnaround with him this morning and hersquos bouncing about as normal. George is a resilient character and its good news. Wersquore pretty sure hersquos going to turn it around quicker than we thought yesterday.There is an obvious temptation to reward the players who got the job done against the worldrsquos third ranked team, in the cut-throat world of professional rugby,nobodyrsquos place in the teamis guaranteed.ldquoWersquove got to pick the right team to complement the challenges wersquoll face against South Africa, stated Dalziel. ldquoThey are very dferent to Australia who have that attack focus and want to play a lot of rugby, whereas with the South Africans it is a physical battle. Straight up and down. They are coming straight through the front door at us.ldquoSo, tactically, and selection-wise, wersquoll look at that.A lot of guys who were maybe quieter in that Tonga game [two weekends ago] have now put their hand up and performed.But when you look around the squad there may be guys who werenrsquot involved at the weekend who might be suited to this challenge, so no doubt there could be and probably will be a few changes around that.ldquoThe squad is growing all the time, and wersquore blessed as coaches to have the group wersquove got now through the good work which is going on at the pro teams and through the age grades, he added.ldquoWersquore able to keep building on that and young players are bouncing off each other. Wersquore seeing thatone player goes to the next level then wersquove got more players looking to push beyond that. Nobody is comfortable in any position.ldquoWersquove got real quality players missing out on selection, and it is hard for us to try and pick the right team for the right opposition now, while making sure that we are keeping everyone hungry, and making sure that people are getting opportunities when they deserve it.Despite the magnitude of the challenge Scotland face on Saturday Dalziel insisted that the team will go into the match believing they have nothing to fear.ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to work with these players for a number of years, from the under-s onwards, he said. ldquoIrsquove seen them grow as men and itrsquos outstanding, the high standards they hold with each other.ldquoAs a group, they deal with setbacks, know the path theyrsquore on, and there is no ceiling.They want to grow and become that Scotland team that is consistent, that can win on the big occasion more often.ldquoTheyrsquore very humble and realise wersquore at the start of the process.Itrsquos a young group with loads of growth to come.

It is understood that at least one class within every year group except P is affected by the spread.The two authorities confirmed, this Thursday evening, that any decision to shut the school would be a collective one — but it has not yet reached that point. The only caveat to this is in the eventuality that staff numbers are so depleted, the council has no option but to close Papdale, or reduce teaching hours.As of early this afternoon, only two members of staff have been confirmed to have the virus.In a statement this evening, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The school remains open, and the situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of NHS Orkney Public Health.“Our aim is to keep the school open as long as possible to provide learning for those pupils who are well. We are working on a daily basis with Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“However,staffing falls to a point whereby it is no longer possible to safely manage the pupil numbers in school — as happened in Stronsay Junior High School recently – then we, as the council, can take the decision to close or offer a rolling programme of reduced hours across the school.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social wellbeing.”The authorities have confirmed that a further ten PCR tests have also been requested in connection with Papdale Primary at this time, and contact tracing is ongoing. Parents with children attending the school have been urged to undertake twice-weekly lateral flow testing on both themselves and their little ones.Of the  pupils at the school,  pupils were absent on Thursday from the school — a drop from  on Wednesday. According to OIC, the reason many of these pupils remained at home was due to the COVID- situation —  whether for the purpose self-isolating, or because they are symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.Warn and inform letters have now been sent to the parents and carers of children in all affected classes within P, P, P, P, P and P, in line with Scottish Government and Public Health guidance.In addition, Papdale#s head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Across Orkney, a total of  new positive cases have been reported in today#s daily figures.According to NHS Orkney, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. The health authority has has said that this continued rise in cases is not unexpected.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “We are continuing to see cases riseand this is another day of high case numbers for Orkney, but we want to reassure the community that we are managing these cases.#Although, we do ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible. Vaccinations are underway for both COVID and Flu and these are progressing, but it is a complex and challenging undertaking.#Appointment letters are being sent out for the COVID booster vaccinations and we appreciate your patience during this time.”If you receive a positive lateral flow test result, or you have developed symptoms of COVID-, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test.

This change will take effect from Monday, November  until at least Wednesday, November .Infection among both pupils and staff at the school have mounted in recent days. As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone. We must all continue to do our bit to try and stem the transmission of the virus, which is undoubtedly here for some time to come. This is now about learning to manage how we live, work and learn with COVID-.

I never had the opportunity to grow and bond with her during pregnancy, to feel her kick.The Cardinalesrsquo complaint accuses the Los Angeles-based Calornia Centre for Reproductive Healthand its owner, Dr Eliran Mor, of medical malpractice, breach of contract, negligence and fraud. It demands a jury trial and seeks unspecied damages.Yvonne Telles, the office administrator for the centre, declined to comment on Monday.

Both couples unwittingly raised the wrong child for nearly three months before DNA tests confirmed that the embryos were swapped, according to the filing.ldquoThe Cardinales, including their young daughter, fell in love with this child, and were terried she would be taken away from them, the complaint says.ldquoAll the while, Alexander and Daphna did not know the whereabouts of their own embryo, and thus were terried that another woman had been pregnant with their child mdash and their child was out in the world somewhere without them.The babies were swapped back in January .Mr Wolf, whose firm specialises in fertility cases, called for greater oversight for IVF clinics.ldquoThis case highlights an industry in desperate need of federal regulation, he said.Breaking the news to their older daughter, now seven, ldquowas the hardest thing in my le, Daphna said.ldquoMy heart breaks for her, perhaps the most, she said.Both babies have been ed to their biological families.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

But as a writer, he seemed to have been almost entirely forgotten – at least until recently. Thankfully his literary reputation is now being restored, with a reissue of his novel F For Ferg, a collection of his short stories in preparation, and a biography soon to be devoted to him.During the s and s, Ian produced an impressive run of six highly original and widely acclaimed novels. Despite moving to London as a teenager, his books drew almost exclusively on the language and characters of his childhood in Dromona and Cullybackey, a territory he explored in his fiction with fresh insight and irrepressible humour. Ian was born on November ,  at Moylarg, the middle child of five. The family lived in a terrace of three small houses, known as the Carry Row due to its proximity to the weir on the River Maine adjacent to Dromona Works. He was taught at Tullygrawley National School by R.L. Russell, an unusually progressive master who encouraged his pupils to express themselves through art, poetry and prose. Ian appeared to take little interest in school, and left as soon as he could at the age of , but his teacher’s ideas clearly took root at some deeper level. Russell encouraged his pupils, above all, to closely observe and describe their local surroundings, and this is exactly what Ian went on to do in his writing.On leaving school, Ian entered the local linen plant, Fraser and Haughton’s at Hillmount, enduring  hour shts in the bleaching department. Never particularly suited to paid employment – as he would have been the first to admit – he lasted less than a year at the mill, before taking up a series of equally short-lived occupations, working on a sheep farm, as a stable-boy looking after race horses for local trainer Hugh Dunlop, and as a petrol-pump attendant at what was then Watt’s garage in Cullybackey.Ian’s adolescent years were also a time of changes and challenges. In the mid-s, the family moved from their little cottage at Moylarg to a brand new four-bedroom property in the recently constructed Ard-na-Maine estate in Cullybackey. At their old house, the Cochranes had kept chickens, grown their own vegetables, and drawn water from the well. By comparison, this new development of  houses felt almost like a city, and the resulting sense of upheaval and dislocation is something Ian explores in many of his novels and stories.It was at this time, too, that he began to observe a deterioration in his eyesight. While working at Watt’s garage, he noticed he was unable to read the petrol-pump dial, or to tell the time on the clock of Buick Memorial school as he walked home along Main Street. His vision worsened to such an extent that experimental surgery was carried out in Belfast, which not only proved futile but caused further, irreparable damage. It was only much later in le that Ian’s condition was identied as Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a rare genetic disorder also subsequently suffered by his brother Drew, nowadays well-known locally as a champion blind golfer.Ian had by this time developed a real passion for reading, devouring books at the home of his friend Dermot McTrusty, whose father had an impressive library – “I thought I was in heaven,” Ian later recalled. He now set about learning Braille, fearing the onset of total blindness, although the illness would thankfully never quite develop to that stage. After attending a training centre for the partially sighted in Torquay, Ian took the bold decision to move to London to follow a course in piano tuning. He set off in , at the age of , and would live there for the rest of his le. By Ian’s own account, as the ferry left Belfast he threw his white stick overboard into the Irish Sea, symbolising his intention to defy disability and live le to the full in the capital. During the s in London, just as he had done as a teenager in Cullybackey, Ian flitted from job to job at a dizzying pace, working as a lt attendant, addiction counsellor, domestic cleaner, telephone sales agentand switchboard operator. After several years of ‘scribbling’ for his own amusement, he finally began to take night classes in creative writing in the late s at Morley College in Lambeth, where his striking narrative style and authentic voice were quickly recognised by his tutors, and his first published story, The Hawk, was printed in the college magazine in . Further stories soon appeared in two highly prestigious anthologies of new writing, Faber’s Introduction and Penguin’s Modern Stories  .The s and early ’s were Ian Cochrane’s heyday. His first two novels, A Streak of Madnessand Gone in the Head , both set in a thinly disguised Cullybackey, won him great praise – his work was proclaimed as “the creation of an extraordinarily gted artist” by The Listener – and he was now able to devote himself full-time to his true vocation. His third novel, Jesus on a Sticktook his boundary-pushing dark humour to new levels Ladybird in a Loony-binexplored mental illness with heightened experimentation and ambition, and F for Fergdepicted the passions and frustrations of village le with a new-found clarity and precision of style. His final novel, The Slipstreamis an entertaining, deliberately aimless tale of unemployed chancers adrt in West London bedsit land.Ian’s novels are all told by a young first-person narrator, in a vernacular voice which deliberately tightens the focus of the action and lends his fiction its peculiar intensity. His originality hinges on a winning blend of the sublime and the ridiculous -rightly described him as “a serious comic novelistever there was one.” He undoubtedly expanded the Ulster ‘literary imagination’, breaking away from the more formal approach of predecessors such as Forrest Reid or Sam Hannah Bell and introducing a more earthy and irreverent tone. His conversational style is rooted quite naturally in the excitable talk and bawdy banter of his native place, but his real achievement was to channel this rich resource so successfully into a literary format. In his later years, Ian continued to write on a near-daily basis, but was unable to find a publisher for the work he produced during this period. Changes in British publishing from the s onwards, when the industry became more profit focused and less editorially driven, made it increasingly dficult to find a place for less obviously commercial fiction, just as his own work, ironically, became more personal, dense and challenging. Yet he remained very much a writer by profession, for whom the practice had a vital therapeutic activity, and he described himself as happiest when hard at work at the old wooden desk in his top-floor flat, warmed by the gas fire, rain beating against the window, blissfully engrossed in his fictional world.Often overlooked and underappreciated during his letime, Ian has recently been afforded some much deserved attention and reassessment. Turnpike Books in London reissued his novel F For Ferg in , followed by a  discussion of his fiction at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy. A collection of his unpublished short stories is currently in preparation, as is my own book on his le and work. A biography of this kind is long overdue: from his isolated rural upbringing to the world of literary London, undaunted by blindness or by his lack of formal education, Ian’s journey is certainly a fascinating and inspiring one.And a new generation of authors has also begun to find inspiration and influence in his writing. Ballymena-born novelist Jan Carson, at the forefront of a new wave of Northern Irish writers, has spoken of how Ian’s books helped her to find her own fictional voice, rooted in her native environment. “What I loved about Ian Cochrane’s work,” she explains, “was the playfulness, and the idea that my local culture was just as ripe and ready for the fantastical, the absurd, the strange, the grotesque.”And as his great friend and fellow County Antrim novelist Maurice Leitch says, “I’m delighted Ian is now getting some of the critical acclaim he truly deserves. It’s just a pity he isn’t with us to bask in all the posthumous accolades, he’d be thoroughly revelling in it!”Anyone who has memories of Ian Cochrane is asked to get in touch with the author, Philip Taylor. Any details, however small, will be useful in building the bigger picture of Ian’s unique le and personality.

I am the kind of guy that would have just ignored it, let it clear itself. All I had was slight stomach cramps and constipation and I let it go for a couple of months. I was just taking tablets to cover it up. “I want people to know you could be covering up something you don’t know is there. It could be nothing but get yourself checked out. “I went to the GP who took bloods and suggested I do a FIT test. The results of the FIT test showed that something wasn’t right and within two weeks I was referred to the Endoscopy unit to have a colonoscopy. “This test showed up something in the bowel. After a week, I got the result that I had bowel cancer. “I received a lot of help and support from the specialist nurses. After that, I had a CT and an ultrasound.” Anthony underwent surgery October  and is currently recovering at home with the support of his we.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital imageNational NewsGardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital image overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital imageNational NewsGardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital image overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cllr Harkin, who represents the Foyleside ward, was speaking after Saturdays Global Day of Action rally in Derry where many turned out to march – in unison with other world cities – to send a message to politicians that too little is being done to halt climate change. googletag.cmd.push Many figures from the Executive parties in Stormont have commented on how environmental changes need to be enforced to curb rising temperatures that could have a disastrous effect on the world with many land area at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels. However, Harkin claims such talk is nothing more than hot air and that politicians need to make good on their words with action. He said: “We commend all those who joined climate action now rallies in Derry and Belfast, across Ireland and across the world yesterday. “It was a powerful global day of action in defiance of the superficial proposals of elites gathered in Glasgow at COP. “All five of the Stormont Executive parties ran to the exclusionary Glasgow conference to join the political establishment in an attempt to showcase their newly found environmental credentials. “As Greta Thunberg said its been more blah blah blah from elites. “Rather than acting as a protector, the Executive has spent the last two decades doing immense damage to our environment. “What the Stormont Executive parties say and do is very dferent. “Just months ago the SDLP Minister for Infrastructure rammed through continued corporate gouging of Lough Neagh over the opposition of environmental campaigners. “The entire Executive allowed the DUP to run riot with the climate destroying going for growth agribusiness strategy for over a decade. “Sinn Feacutein and others said nothing because profits were high and it was good for elites. The same inaction is true for the RHI cash for ash debacle. “The same action gap is clear when it comes expanding rail and public transportation. “The lack of urgency from the DfI Minister means it could be a decade before the Derry rail upgrade happens –at all. And there are constant threats to slash funding for public transportation in order to open it up to privatisation. “The same inaction applies to cleaning up the toxic Mobuoy dump, air quality and toxic mining in the Sperrins. “There are real solutions to address the climate crisis. This requires challenging capitalisms drive for profit no matter what the consequences are for communities and nature. “The political establishment in the Stormont Executive, the Daacuteil and Westminster are not up for this because it means challenging elites, challenging inequality and challenging the status quo. “If Stormont manages to finally pass a Climate Act, the Executive cannot be trusted to ensure even its limited goals will be acted on. “We need a real alternative to the bluff and bluster of the Stormont Executive parties.

Padraig Delargy, Cllr Sandra Duffy and Cllr Emma McGinley are also in attendance.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson has launched a blistering attack on Environment Minister, Edwin Poots, demanding he “end his dithering and delaying and his half hearted approach to tackling the global emergency”. As the COP conference looking at climate change enters its second week in Glasgow, Ms Ferguson said that more should be done by the Executive to show that the North of Ireland is playing its part in halting the rise in climate temperature. googletag.cmd.push She stressed the need for progressive views to come to the fore at Stormont and that Mr Poots, who once served as DUP leader for three weeks, should step up to the plate and push through “ambitious legislation” on climate change. Ms Ferguson said: “It’s important across the globe that we send a strong message to world leaders that there must be immediate and decisive action to deal with our climate emergency. “This is a global crisis that requires a global solution, and everyone has a role to play in halting catastrophic climate change. “The DUP minister responsible for the environment is dithering and delaying on climate action and his approach has been at best half-hearted. That’s unacceptable.  Northern Ireland Executive Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Edwin Poots “Civic society, environmental groups, legal experts have come together along with progressive political parties and politicians to shape and launch our own climate bill. “Hopefully these progressive views will translate into a majority for real action on the floor of the Assembly. “The North needs ambitious legislation and it needs it before the end of this political mandate in April. “We need net zero targets which enable our businesses, agriculture, infrastructure and energy providers to plan for the future in a transformative way for our society and its population that creates opportunities for green economic growth and jobs. “But we can leave no inidual, community or sector behind in our pursuit of a sustainable future for ourselves and those that come behind us. Nor can we cannot expect the least well off or the vulnerable to pay the cost. “The climate crisis must be tackled on the premise – and with the promise of a just transition. “The climate emergency recognises no borders and we must respond with an all Ireland approach to the climate emergency. That is just common sense.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital imageNational NewsGardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital image overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The measure means that all essential frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month period. googletag.cmd.push This announcement has come as a huge relief and means these local workers and their families have a signicant degree of protection in the event they are unable to attend work due to ill health and reflects the importance of being in a trade union. Along with this new contractual improvement, UNISON trade union representatives working in Apex also successfully negotiated a Covid- recognition payment for all frontline workers. Niall McCarroll of UNISON said: “This recognition agreement between UNISON and Apex Housing Association has only become a reality as a direct result of local workers joining UNISON, becoming active in their workplace and organising towards achieving better working conditions and improved pay and terms and conditions of employment. “Local trade union members mobilising with the support of their union and changing the very ethos and culture across their place of work. “Across Apex Housing Association there are currently  workers in UNISON with workplace reps, health and safety reps and workplace contacts operating across the entire workforce, providing support and expertise when the need arises with the focus being, to leave no worker feeling isolated whilst building up a culture of solidarity, strength through a genuine unity of purpose. “There is much still to achieve within Apex Housing Association but with the growing numbers of workers joining UNISON, it will only be a matter of time before UNISON and Apex deliver on the outstanding issues. I would encourage any local worker employed in the Community and Voluntary Sector to make contact with UNISON Community Branch. “Together we can make positive changes in your workplace and begin the process of you being valued for the work you complete within the community. “Do not let any employer tell you there is no point in being in a trade union.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital imageNational NewsGardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital image overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Greenlough vs. Steelstown Brian Og’s Ballymaguigan, pm Referee – Gregory McWilliams  , ,  and now  – No one knows just what a Steelstown victory would mean today more than Marty Dunne. The veteran goalkeeper has been there through it all over the years, the joy and excitement of reaching Intermediate finals paling in comparison to the pain of losing them, and often in such cruel circumstances. googletag.cmd.push Dunne could only watch on as Paddy Henry’s effort  seconds from the end, won the game for Castledawson at Celtic Park in . He had to wait another six years for a second chance, only for Castledawson to defeat them by a single point again, this time at Owenbeg. Whilst not as dramatic as Henry’s winner, the loss of a last minute Steelstown free kick, due to Mickey McKinney lashing out at Niall Keenan, saw the opportunity for a replay lost, and Steelstown bodies crashed to the ground in dismay at the final whistle. Four years later and it seemed it might finally be Steelstown’s year – they held a good lead against Greenlough at Bellaghy, but they let it slip, and an error by Dunne himself led to a goal for Michael McDonnell in added time. There was no way back. So, in , Steelstown still await their first title, and Dunne, still going strong at , has one more chance to get his hands on a trophy that has eluded his grasp for over a decade. This will be his fth final - fourth Intermediate, one junior - and he knows just how fortunate he is to get another opportunity. “Its one thing you understand when you get older you appreciate them more and you look forward to them,” he said. “You know they are not going to come around all the time. When you’re younger you think ‘we’ll get plenty of these’, but you realise how sparse they are now so it’s good to be in it again and get another chance at it. “We would have killed to be back in this position after last year. A lot of teams could just fade away after something like that and not get back up there again, so we’re lucky in that regard in that we’re straight back where we want to be and we can have another rattle at them.” Last year’s final is still fresh in his mind, and it is he who brings up his short kick-out which led to that late McMullan goal. That is a regret, but he doesn’t lose sleep over it. “These things happen in matches,” he acknowledged. “All you can do is try and put it right again. Once it’s done it’s done. You are a goalkeeper and you’re going to make these mistakes, so these things are going to happen, especially in the heat of a final when you’re trying to rush things and trying to do things. It will not be in my head anyway, that’s for sure. “We were up by three points I think going into the final quarter and we never really kicked on. We kind of sat back and we never pushed on to get that result. You always think you should have won it and my contribution at the end didn’t help. These things happen so I’m looking forward to getting a second chance at it.”  Weight of history Everyone knows by now that Steelstown are still without that elusive first title, but Dunne, who has every right to feel that the club deserves one by now, does not believe that the weight of history should be a factor this weekend. “The first one is always the hardest to get over the line, but it’s a dferent group of players,” he explained. “I don’t think the young boys will be too concerned about that, it’s still just one match against Greenlough who are a good side and it will be hard to win. You would like to experience getting over finals, but the only way you can do that is by winning your first one.” It is impossible not to notice the progress made at Steelstown over recent years- from their senior ladies, to their reserves, to their underage work – the club is synonymous with success in so many ways. Dunne has enjoyed being a part of that, but he knows from the grassroots up to senior, nothing can ever be taken for granted “There’s been ups and downs but you always think it’s going to be a straight line up,” he reflected. “Going into senior was brilliant even though we didn’t win Intermediate, we stepped into senior and that was good, getting a run at senior. I wish we had stayed there, it’s disappointing to be back down in Intermediate, because we could have stayed on there. “This group of players are good enough for senior and that’s where they need to be. In the long term that’s what those guys need. “You always want the trajectory heading up the ways and that’s the next step but you want to win a championship. That’s the point. If we were to get that it would definitely help that group of players push on. It seems that every time Steelstown are in a final it’s a young team, but we probably have a better balance than we ever had there’s plenty of older heads there and younger boys spread throughout the team.” Hugh McGrath’s team were very impressive in Sunday’s semi-final win over the Limavady Wolfhounds. The -, - victory was borne from slick and clinical attacking play and the game was over as a contest by the half time break. Steelstown are going into the final with great momentum. “We made a good start, pegging on the scores and keeping the pressure on,” Dunne agrees. “There was a wide range of scorers so we weren’t relying on one or two scorers. It was good to get it over the line with a decent performance, but obviously Greenlough is going to be a step up again, we’re under no illusions about that. Our heads are pretty level one thing about this group is that they won’t get ahead of themselves in any regard. “We have to go at them and take them on, and get the scores on the board and be confident. We did that in the final against them last year but then we dried up and didn’t really push on, and we sat back a bit which isn’t really our style. You can’t throw away -point leads or -pount leads, you just can’t do it because you can’t stop momentum thenit turns against you. You have to keep pushing on.”  The future Dunne had decided to retire two years ago, but he was convinced by Eamon Gibson tolast year, and as  comes to an end he is still the main man for Steelstown. He knows by now not to look too far ahead, but he would dearly love to get that trophy in his hands before that final game comes. What a fairytale ending that would be for a terric club servant. “I’ll not look beyond Saturday’s match and see how it pans out from there,” he said. “Things could be very dferent depending on the dferent outcomes, so I haven’t given too much thought to it. “That’s why you keep going, because you want to win something. There’s plenty of people out there who don’t even get the chance to get to a final, plenty of players who have played for a lot longer than me and haven’t had much to show for it. As much as you can look back and say it’s disappointing not to win, at least you have got this one more chance, and that’s all you can ever have, that one chance every year, so take it, and I’m just looking forward to that.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital imageNational NewsGardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital image overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute  Dergview  It was another opportunity missed for Institute as they could only draw with Dergview at the Brandywell. It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat. The home side were thrown a leline just before the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty. A cross into the Dergview box found Aaron McGurk, whose touch took the ball away from him. Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot. Dergview were baffled by the decision, but after their protests, McLaughlin kept his calm to score his first goal in  games and his th for the season overall to make it -. ‘Stute had a great chance to take the lead in the game for the first time on  minutes when McGurk did well to work his way into the area, and although his shot was blocked, the ball fell out of the sky right onto the foot of McLaughlin, who volleyed wide with the whole goal to aim at. Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital imageNational NewsGardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital image overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital imageNational NewsGardai renew public appeal to identy human skull with aid of new digital image overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like. Anyway. googletag.cmd.push For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul.

A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships.

Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War .

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   .

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

Perhaps there is something to this global warming malarkey after all EDAC had two juniors taking part. Both were using the course as practice for the more competitive All-Ireland races coming up in the middle of November.Alex Robinson ran in the U- race which was two loops of the one-mile course. He ran very well and held onto fourth place for most of the race, just ping to fth on the final turn. The hills drained his legs so he couldnrsquot master a sprint.He finished the two-mile course in a time of ., which at just over six minutes per mile, is nothing to be disappointed with for cross country.Oliver Robinson ran in the U- race.

Oliver finished third boy overall. Well done to both lads for continuously keeping the East Down name to the fore, week in week out.EDAC member Patrick Smith also made the long trip to Bangor on Saturday to take part in the gloriously titled North Down Festival of Cross Country Running, just to try it out.Although he was the sole EDAC representative, he soon settled into a good rhythm, despite the very tricky underfoot conditions brought about by heavy overnight rain, which almost flies in the face of the seemingly never ending forecasts of impending global warming doom.He was only running to have a go at cross country, since all his club colleagues had been fulsome in their praise for last weekendrsquos races in Comber, and also to re-kindle the love for the genre, some  years after his last attempt.So without over exerting himself and drinking in the applause of the spectators, he finished in a highly respectable . and th place in a high quality field.Despite Patrick being unduly critical of his performance, he had finished the course in what is a pretty good time for a cross country race. Race position is only a number.Well done Patrick, no need to run down your achievements, yoursquoll find plenty to do that, keep your chin up and keep going.Coach Ryan Maxwell sent Gordy Graham off to the Armagh ten miler on Sunday as his first building block on the road to the Manchester Marathon next spring.Gordy said that it was a brilliant event but a tough courseyou were after a personal best.

He said the local company, which is the largest private employer in the Killyleagh area, regrets that after two yearsrsquo growth, it has been necessary to lay off staff.The spokesman said evenit had not been for the events in America on September , there has been an unfortunate downturn in the leather clothing business.ldquoAs a result of reduced orders, it has been necessary to take this short term step and we would stress these are lay-offs not redundancies and we remain optimistic about the future, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK ndash A vandalism attack on the GPrsquos emergency vehicle placed patientsrsquo lives across the district at risk last week.Doctors have revealed that had the Pound Lane attack in Downpatrick not been spotted by paramedics based at the Downe Hospital, the consequences for patients could have been fatal.Two tyres on the special car used by GPs belonging to the DowneDoc GP co-operative were slashed during the early hours of Thursday morning in an attack described as a ldquofrightening new development.The emergency vehicle, which is packed with vital medical equipment, was targeted outside the Pound Lane Health Clinic sometime between .am and .am. The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the Downpatrick attack as a ldquofrightening new development because the vandals deliberately put the emergency car off the road by puncturing both tyres.He also confirmed an immediate review of security has been ordered in the wake of the attack to ensure it does not happen again and that patients lives are not put at risk.SEAFORDE ndash Criminals have once again targeted a family-owned business on the Newcastle to Seaforde Road.Police are investigating the most recent attack on Brennanrsquos service station during which a car rammed into the front of the building on Thursday evening, causing

vehicle without taking anything from the premises.It is understood that they were attempting to access a cash machine inside the building but were disturbed before they got to the machine.Councillor Patsy Toman said people throughout the community were ldquodisgusted that the McKibbenrsquos family business had been targeted.ldquoThis family is working hard to serve the district and they have installed the cash machine as a service to local people which some think was the target for last weekrsquos attack, he said.ldquoIt would be a real pitythis cash machine had to be removed to stop vandals attacking the store.DRUMANESS ndash Drunken vandals ran amok in a night of horric Halloween violence in Drumaness last week.Parts of the village were vandalised as the teenagers, some of whom were brandishing fireworks, terrorised residents in the village on Wednesday night.The situation was so bad that local politicians and police were called to speak with teenagers in a bid to quell the trouble and a number of parents were also contacted to take their children home.Local councillor, Mr Patsy Toman, said many people were disgusted at the behaviour of the teenagers, many of whom he claimed were fuelled by alcohol they had bought illegally.Mr Toman, who was called to the village along with Down Council chairwoman, Mrs Anne McAleenan, said the widespread hooliganism and violence has no place in Drumaness and hopes the situation will not be repeated.He said young children and elderly people were terried as the teenagers ran amok and claimed the damage to property was widespread.ldquoThe majority of the teenagers responsible for the trouble were tanked up on illegal alcohol they had purchased and there is a real underage drinking problem in Drumaness which has to be addressed, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Northern Ireland Electricity will invest pound, on improvements to the Ballynahinch network over the next six months.NIE officials have confirmed that the

I did so because my mum Marilyn has had liver cancer for the last three years.Alistair said that the Boston Marathon was quite an emotional event for him this time due to his motherrsquos illness.ldquoI ran as part of a charity team with  people from all over the States and some other international runners and I got to hear why other people were running and their situations as well.The overall time effort was raising , which will go into medical research.Alistair has raised thousands more for other charities, such as Barnardorsquos, from his running.He felt that running the marathon was not as challenging as actually getting to Boston.Alistair explained: ldquoThere was lots of training without knowingit would even happen, waiting and hoping the US border would open to allow travel and when it didnrsquot in time, I had to convince the US Consulate in Belfast to grant me a special exemption to travel, so there were lots of hurdles to overcome on this journey.Alistairrsquos achievements are all the more impressive since he only took up running nearly six years ago.ldquoI decided to take up running for fitness and I used a couch to K running app on my phone.

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests.

I had previously requested a site meeting with officials to look at the key areas where the issue is most prominent and have been told that talks will take place, alongside some preliminary work.Mr McGrath said this included the continued dosing of sewage at an upstream wastewater pumping station, with NI Water looking to acquire additional land to construct a permanent dosing plant.ldquoSome very welcome news is that a local businessman plans to treat waste generated at his premises before it enters the sewerage system, he said.ldquoThe new system should be up and running in the coming weeks and this is the sort of community activity that Downpatrick does best local people identying solutions and putting their shoulder to the wheel.Mr McGrath said he will continue to seek progress reports from NI Water and keep local people up-to-date with whatrsquos happening.He added: ldquoItrsquos my hope that we are approaching an appropriate and sustainable solution to this long running issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Trust committed to Downe MRI scanner  ","story":"THE districtrsquos most senior health official said she would welcome regular conversations with the public and politicians in helping shape ldquosafe and appropriate services across the area.The commitment by South Eastern Trust chief executive Roisin Coulter came after a meeting she had on Monday with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors.Describing the talks as ldquouseful, positive, open and honest, Mrs Coulter said the health trust was ldquoproud to offer health and social care services from over  facilities across the Down area.She said that since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, all services apart from urgent care have been restored to the Downe Hospital in Downpatrick, where  inpatient beds are open and all outpatient services back up and running.The health chief also issued a reminder that the regional review of urgent and emergency care services across Northern Ireland which is being led by the Department of Health is expected shortly.ldquoIt is anticipated that this review will influence the future of all urgent and emergency care services throughout Northern Ireland, said Mrs Coulter, confirming that the health trust continues to provide a consultant led urgent care centre at the Downe from Monday to Friday between am and pm, alongside a nurse-led minor injuries service on Saturday and Sunday and GP out-of-hours service.ldquoThe urgent care centre has proven very successful with the public and treats an average of  patients every day, the health chief continued.ldquoWe remain committed to the installation of a new MRI scanner at the Downe. Indeed, this is a capital priority for the organisation. However, it requires approval from the Health and Social Care Board and the Department of Health.Mrs Coulter acknowledged that Covid- has had a signicant impact on the mental health of many people and posed unprecedented challenges for the health service.She continued: ldquoPrior to Covid, the system was already facing huge strategic challenges in the form of an ageing population, increasing demand, long and growing waiting lists, workforce pressures and the emergence of new and more expensive treatments.ldquoWithin the Trust, an enormous effort has been put in to introduce telephone and video-based appointments for mental health service users. The use of digital media to remotely contact service users has been very successful and has enabled teams to hold more consultation appointments.Mondayrsquos meeting with councillors also heard that the health and wellbeing of staff across the South Eastern Trust is of vital importance, with Mrs Coulter heartened to hear that council members said they appreciated and valued the care provided across all of the services the organisation provides locally.The chief executive stressed that she was both ldquooptimistic and realistic about the future as staff deal with the fourth surge of the pandemic and prepare for the expected winter pressures.Mrs Coulter added: ldquoOur health and social care services are facing unprecedented demand, and we so appreciate the tireless dedication and commitment of all our staff.ldquoI would welcome further, regular conversations with Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the public in shaping services that are safe and appropriate across the Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13182396.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These volunteers didn’t put on a unorm and work long and dangerous hours over and above their daily employment hours to assist in any sectarianism. Like myself they made a decision to play their part in keeping the peace. They put their heads above the parapet, put their personal safety and that of their families on the line, making many sacrices to their quality of le in doing so. They were targets for terrorists   whether in or out of unorm and remained so even when they left the service.

Please try again later.Submitting...Loyalists angry at the Brexit protocol claim the imposition of economic barriers on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has changed the region’s constitutional position within the UK.The support of the PUP and other loyalist representatives was crucial in concluding the Good Friday Belfast Agreement deal that largely ended decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.Mr Hutchinson said the principle of consent has been exposed as “little more than a deceptive snare”.“It is my view that , as is currently the case, the constitutional guarantee is not as was promised to the unionist community, then there is no basis for unionist support for the Belfast Agreement,” he said.Billy HutchinsonMr Hutchinson insisted the PUP remains a “firm and dedicated” supporter of peace in Northern Ireland.In March, an umbrella group representing three loyalist paramilitary groups – the UVF, Ulster Defence Association and Red Hand Commando – announced they were temporarily withdrawing their backing of the Good Friday accord.They also cited concerns about the contentious arrangements governing Irish Sea trade post-Brexit.However, they stressed that unionist opposition to the protocol should remain “peaceful and democratic”.The PUP has limited electoral strength in Northern Ireland.The party has no MLAs at Stormont and three local councillors out of a total of  council seats in the region.Mr Hutchinson said the principle of consent in “practice has failed to protect the substance of the Union” and instead has led to its “incremental weakening”.He said the protocol is a “real and present threat to the substance of the Union”.And he said the “peace process” was not based on a faithful reading of the  accord and rather a vaguer concept of the “spirit” of the agreement – a spirit he claimed has only delivered concessions to nationalists.“If the ‘process’, as it seems, is little more than a vehicle to incrementally dismantle the Union we cherish, then the Progressive Unionist Party will be champions of peace, but firm opponents of the process,” he said.He added: “The core basis that I have set out for the Progressive Unionist Party’s support for the Belfast Agreement, namely that the principle of consent secured the Union, means the Union in substance can no longer be said to apply in any meaningful way.“It follows therefore that it would be to perpetuate an act of intellectual deceit upon our party members, and the unionist and loyalist people whom we represent,I, as party leader, did not honestly and forthrightly call attention to this most serious of issues.”Mr Hutchinson went on: “A Belfast Agreement which is based upon a deception on the core constitutional protection that was said to exist for our community is not the Belfast Agreement I signed up to and urged others to support in .”He set out a plan for restoring unionist and loyalist confidence.He urged the UK Government to initiate a review of the  Northern Ireland Act, which gave legislative effect to the agreement, with a “view to strengthening the principle of consent”.He said the cross-community consent mechanism in the Assembly, which requires proposals to achieve the support of both a majority of nationalists and a majority of unionists, must be applied to any vote on the continuance of post-Brexit trading arrangements.The vote on the continuance of the protocol, due in , is currently based on a straight majority vote.Mr Hutchinson also called for the restoration of the concept of “equal citizenship” across the UK. He said key to achieving that is restoring commitments in the Acts of Union that all parts of the UK be on an equal footing in matters of trade and treaties.He added: “I will continue to work constructively with leaders of all other unionist parties, and key stakeholders within the unionist family, to secure the removal of the intolerable and constitutionally damaging protocol.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

While acknowledging the work led to delays for motorists, Councillor Lavelle McIlwrath said they were viewed as a necessaryevil in order to deliver services to the area.However, he criticisedthe condition of the repair work between the traffic lights at Mahon junction an Ridgeway Park, describing it as “diabolical”.“I have had numerous complaints from motorists about the way the Armagh Road has been left.“The section of roadway that was dug up cannot now be avoided as you drive towards town and the uneven way the repaired carriageway has been left is shocking.“The irony is that this stretch of roadway was one of the better ones in the area prior to the roadworks and is now one of the worst.”Cllr McIlwrath confirmed he had raisedthe matter with both Firmus Energy and the Department for Infrastructure and said they energy firm has agreed tothe road to its original standard.“I raisedthe matter directly with Firmus Energy as well as the Department for Infrastructure,” he said.“I am pleased to confirm that Firmus Energy has agreed to revisittheir repairs at the Armagh Road and ensure that this stretch of carriageway is ed to its original standard.“The work will take several weeks to plan and coordinate.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, a spokesperson for Firmus Energy confirmed the road surface will be repaired.“We have been liaising with Councillor McIlwrath, the Department for Infrastructure and our contractors to agree a plan to repair the road surface and hope to have that work completed as soon as possible.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Photo: PacemakerUpper Bann MLA Mrs Kelly was quoted in a newspaper article as saying this week’s PSNI th anniversary was the perfect opportunity to recommit to the principle of a shared police force. The SDLP policing board member also said the creation of the PSNI was a “signicant departure from the institutionalised sectarianism represented by the RUC”.Those comments led to the NI Retired Police Officers’ Association penning an open letter to Mrs Kelly, in which the NIRPOA chairman called on the MLA to withdraw her remarks, and to apologise for the “gross offence” caused.The letter states: “I am writing to seek your immediate withdrawal of that remark, and an apology for the gross offence you have caused to the thousands of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC who served this community in the most challenging of times.”Mrs Kelly responded, saying: “The SDLP has previously paid tribute to the sacrices made by many RUC officers and their families.“The fact remains that there were severe institutional problems within the RUC and this is a matter of public record. That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Most PopularPortadown school contacts PSNI after TikTok accounts aimed at humiliating teachers condemnedNumber of COVID patients in Craigavon Hospital doubles in two weeksMan lost consciousness after being struck from behind in Lurgan attackCraigavon men facing charges of aggravated burglary after pensioner was confronted in his Tandragee homeTeenage boy stabbed at Halloween Fireworks Display in CraigavonMost PopularMike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC commentsStephen Barriskill killing: PSNI charge -year-old man with murderRoad repairs branded ‘diabolical’Halloween hooligans’ rampage in Lurgan ‘terried’ residentsBuilding firms from across NI offer jobs after JMC Mechanical and Construction Ltd, goes into liquidation                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
