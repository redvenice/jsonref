[{"url":null,"title":"Covid cases South Africa SOAR 92 just days scientists raised alarm Omicron variant","story":"Share this articleShare this articleThe booster rollout has been plagued by problems since launching in September, however, which has raised concerns about whether it can cope with the increased capacity.GPs say they are too busy trying to deal with record non-Covid care backlogs that have amassed during the pandemic and figures show there are a third fewer mass vaccination hubs giving out boosters now compared to the initial vaccine rollout.Vulnerable patients say they\u0027ve had to wait weeks to get a booster appointment because most are being administered in local pharmacies that are operating with limited staff and during limited hours.  Mr Johnson spoke out amid grave concerns in the NHS about his 500,000 jabs a day target to outpace Omicron — as ministers lined up GPs to do the work but doctors claimed they are \u0027burnt out\u0027 and warned more face-to-face appointments with patients will have to go if they are expected to help.    Today the Health Service Journal reported that from December 1, doctors will receive £15 for each jab given from Monday to Saturday – up from £12.58. This will reach £20 for Sunday and Bank Holiday vaccinations until the end of January. The pay for jabs in care homes and houses will also rise.One NHS chief executive said getting GPs to lead the surge was \u0027a very big ask, on top of many other very big asks\u0027, adding it would be extremely difficult to reach the 3.5million rate due to a lack of medics, volunteers and facilities after a third of vaccination centres closed this summer.A GP practice manager tweeted: \u0027Cash won\u0027t make much difference, it\u0027s the workload \u0026amp workforce that\u0027s the problem. Is not just jabbers but the back room engine tracking and calling patients, organising rotas, sorting out logistics etc\u0027. Soldiers will also be called back. Some are currently helping deliver the vaccine in Scotland but not in England. Before they were stood down in July, as well as putting jabs in arms, they also co-ordinated distribution of the vaccines and set up vaccination centres. Tens of thousands of volunteers and retired doctors and nurses who helped over the past 12 months will also be needed again this winter. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said: \u0027We\u0027ve already done almost 18 million boosters across the UK but we\u0027ve got millions more to do to protect the most vulnerable.\u0027Then we\u0027ll move down the cohorts rapidly, and working together with the devolved administrations we want to ramp up capacity across the whole United Kingdom to the levels we achieved in the previous vaccination effort.\u0027We\u0027re going to be throwing everything at it in order to ensure that everyone eligible is offered that booster, as I say, in just over two months.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Javid urges people Covid tests going Christmas parties","story":"\u0027Obviously, the booster vaccination campaign is very welcome and I\u0027m sure that will help, and really the the last thing on the cards is more social distancing and how seriously we take that.\u0027I think, at the moment, one of my concerns is that there is an intensification of social mixing just in the run-up to Christmas and the timing of that is a bit unfortunate, given these circumstances.\u0027I\u0027m not saying that those events should be stopped or banned, but I think, you know, people might think about spending more time outside, trying to keep more of a distance, wearing masks at them, potentially taking tests before they go and potentially taking tests after they\u0027ve been to one and before they go and visit their relatives at Christmas.\u0027  Boris Johnson insisted he had already put in place a package of \u0027balanced and proportionate measures\u0027 in response to the threat posed by the new variant as cases of Omicron reached 22 in the UK.The mandatory wearing of facemasks in shops and on public transport came into force in England yesterday, along with tighter testing requirements for international travel and the return of self-isolation for contacts of confirmed Omicron cases, even if they have been fully vaccinated.But it is the booster campaign which the Government believes provides the greatest line of defence against the new variant and the Prime Minister promised that everyone eligible would be offered a booster jab by the end of January with at least 400 military personnel helping the NHS, and vaccination centres \u0027popping up like Christmas trees\u0027.Mr Javid said Omicron cases are likely to go higher and \u0027we have to be realistic\u0027 that there is already likely to be transmission within the community.Dr Harries had earlier told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that even if \u0027vaccines appear to be effective, but we find that the variant is more highly transmissible, having lowish grade infection, but in very large numbers of the population, (it) could still be a significant impact on our hospitals\u0027.\u0027And, of course, our behaviours in winter and particularly around Christmas, we tend to socialise more, so I think all of those will need to be taken into account,\u0027 she added.\u0027If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay.\u0027She suggested \u0027being careful, not socialising when we don\u0027t particularly need to\u0027 and getting a booster jab.The comments caused alarm in the hospitality industry and helped fuel a Tory backbench revolt which saw Conservatives rebel over new restrictions.Asked whether parties and Nativity plays should be scrapped, Mr Johnson said: \u0027We don\u0027t want people to cancel such events and we think that, overwhelmingly, the best thing for kids is to be at school, as I have said many times throughout this pandemic.\u0027He also rejected suggestions that advice on working from home should be reinstated in England, as is happening in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, in response to the concerns about Omicron.Scientists believe Omicron could be more transmissible than the dominant Delta variant and may render vaccines less effective because of the extent of its mutations.Mr Johnson, who visited a festive food market set up in Downing Street after the press conference, will be asked about the Government\u0027s approach again during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the Commons today.In the Commons on Tuesday, 19 Tories – with two rebel tellers – opposed the mask-wearing measures.Some 32 Conservatives rebelled by voting against the self-isolation regulations while two more acted as tellers for the noes, but the measures both comfortably passed.Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the powerful Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, said there were \u0027serious concerns\u0027 about the \u0027efficacy of what is being proposed\u0027, and warned against \u0027mission creep\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Commuters say people wearing face coverings Tube","story":"Share this article\u0027And not just the leisure business, were getting quite a few bookings cancelled for meetings and events. I know, for instance, some of the larger bookings – we just recently opened our new flagship at the Fairmont in Windsor, and they actually had big large corporates who had bookings in January who are saying \u0027\u0027actually, we may want to push it back to further, later in the year to get some more clarity on where we\u0027re heading\u0027\u0027.\u0027It comes as Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said some NHS organisations had asked staff \u0027not to mix in big groups\u0027 in the run-up to Christmas owing to fears off staff absences.She told Sky News this year was \u0027very different\u0027 to last year when \u0027it was absolutely clear that nobody was going to a Christmas party\u0027.She added: \u0027This year, we are in in a slightly different place - people will be taking their own decisions.\u0027We know that many NHS trusts, for example, are asking their staff not to mix in big groups in the run-up to Christmas because of the potential threat to their health and what they will be available to do.\u0027So, they are setting one example there.\u0027I think, at the moment, without that advice for Government, I think it\u0027s for iniduals and inidual organisations to think about what they will be doing in the run-up to Christmas. But it\u0027s a really challenging and difficult one.\u0027The thing we can encourage everyone to do is to go out and get their booster when it\u0027s made available to them and to book in for that because that\u0027s one of the best defences that we\u0027ve got alongside wearing masks, washing your hands and also making sure you\u0027re in ventilated rooms.\u0027Leaked minutes of a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies meeting held on Monday, seen by the BBC, show that scientists believe booster jabs are likely to provide protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death from most variants in the short term.But the notes say: \u0027Any significant reduction in protection against infection could still result in a very large wave of infections.\u0027This would, in turn, lead to a potentially high number of hospitalisations even with protection against severe disease being less affected.\u0027  It comes as easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said bookings had \u0027softened\u0027 since the Omicron strain emerged and the Government brought in costly travel rules that will require passengers to isolate until they have a negative PCR test result regardless of their vaccination status.Mr Lundgren, writing in the Daily Mail, pointed out airline shares had dropped 13 per cent within hours of the announcement of the change. \u0027Ministers must ensure their decisions are backed by data and precautions are kept in proportion to the threat,\u0027 he said.And Emirates airline president Tim Clark said a hit to the peak December travel season – when millions across the world travel to see friends and family – would cause \u0027significant traumas\u0027 for businesses.Critics have claimed that Mr Johnson\u0027s announcements are an over-reaction, given that only 22 omicron cases have so far been found in England. And early signs are that the variant is a mild form of the virus.They say the moves are contributing to a renewed climate of fear, hitting consumer confidence – with the hospitality sector especially hit. Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u0027This will cost the economy billions. It is a calamity. Christmas parties are off.\u0027Writing in the Mail, Patrick Dardis, head of Young\u0027s pubs, claimed: \u0027Within hours of the country being told that a new variant of Covid had been identified, the phones started ringing in the 300 pubs, restaurants and hotels in the Young\u0027s chain.\u0027And it wasn\u0027t good news: the cancellation of Christmas parties, dinner bookings scrapped, weekend events in December delayed until who knows when, mini-breaks binned. This scenario is being repeated up and down the land.\u0027Damian Wawrzyniak, an award-winning chef who runs House of Feasts in Peterborough, told the BBC: \u0027We had 20 cancellations over the weekend, mostly for Christmas parties. Hospitality has been waiting for Christmas and if it\u0027s not what we were hoping for, there\u0027s going to be some casualties.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"GPs workload slashed focus new national mission booster drive","story":"Share this article\u0027Now, that will go up, it will certainly go up, but the numbers are low, I hope it sort of stays that way.\u0027So, I am not worried about a pingdemic type situation but we have always also said that even before we knew about the variant in our Plan A we have always been clear that as you get into deeper winter, the colder, darker days, the virus likes that, not just this virus, the flu virus, they like that.\u0027So as we do that then people should just be careful to try and think can they ventilate a room and just follow the current guidance.\u0027Dr Harries sparked a Tory backlash and warnings from the hospitality industry yesterday after she said decreasing social contact \u0027a little bit\u0027 could help slow the spread of the new variant.She said that \u0027if we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay\u0027.Downing Street subsequently slapped down the advice as it stressed a reduction in socialising is not part of the Government\u0027s response to Omicron.Mr Johnson later echoed a similar sentiment at a Number 10 press conference as he said Christmas parties should still go ahead.Mr Javid was asked for his opinion on the issue this morning as he said: \u0027I think people should continue to behave in the way that they were planning to behave over Christmas.\u0027I don\u0027t think there is any need to change those plans. The only changes that have been made in the last few days are the ones that everyone now knows about.\u0027It might effect your international travel plans, so if someone had plans to travel over Christmas then there could be an impact there.\u0027There is the need to self-isolate if you come into contact with someone with Omicron.\u0027The Health Secretary was also asked if people should take a coronavirus test before attending a Christmas party.He replied: \u0027I would. I would. It is not a formal recommendation in the guidance but if I was going to a party with lots of party and things I would.\u0027But I would have done that by the way even before we knew about this variant.\u0027Again, the reason I would have done that is because it is getting cold, it is getting darker, we are spending more time indoors, probably more people indoors than before just because of the colder, darker days, so a sensible precaution that everyone can take.\u0027  NHS waiting list could DOUBLE to 12 million in just four years: Millions of patients who missed out on vital care during Covid pandemic could increase huge backlog, damning report warns By ELEANOR HAYWARD FOR THE DAILY MAIL NHS waiting lists could double to 12 million by 2025 despite billions more in taxpayers’ cash being pumped into our hospital wards, a damning report has concluded.The National Audit Office (NAO) said millions of patients had missed out on vital care during the pandemic – and could now return to the health service to increase the backlog.The number currently waiting for NHS care already stands at a record 5.83 million. But the NAO warned this could double to 12 million in a little over three years.Its report also warned the health service was falling dramatically short on all key targets – including cancer care – with the ‘catastrophic’ consequences costing lives.And it suggested Boris Johnson’s controversial new ‘health and social care levy’ would be inadequate to prevent hospital waiting lists continuing to soar. The report is likely to add to fears the NHS will swallow up almost all of the money from the new levy in the coming years, leaving little for the collapsing social care sector. Yesterday\u0027s study by the NAO – an independent watchdog that scrutinises public spending for Parliament – provides the most in-depth assessment to date of the horrifying legacy of the pandemic on non-Covid care.Even under its best case scenario, the NAO said the number of people in England waiting for routine care – currently at a record 5.8 million – will increase to 7 million in 2025.But if the NHS were to perform activity at pre-pandemic levels, this would actually reach 12 million by 2025 – meaning one fifth of the population was caught in the backlog.Experts warned if the Omicron variant leads to more disruption and lockdowns this winter there will be an ‘even bigger mountain to climb’. The report said up to 9.1 million patients missed out on referrals for elective care, saying ‘millions have avoided seeking or been unable to obtain healthcare during the pandemic’.Many were put off seeking help due to the Government’s ‘stay at home message’, while others had vital operations and appointments cancelled as hospitals dealt with an influx of Covid-19 patients.The NAO said it had been ‘impossible’ for the NHS to maintain cancer care throughout the crisis and treatment including chemotherapy ‘dropped significantly’. There were between 240,000 and 740,000 ‘missing’ urgent GP referrals for suspected cancer from March 2020 to September 2021. And between 35,000 and 60,000 fewer people started treatment for cancer than would have been expected during this time frame.The authors of the report said it is uncertain how many ‘missing’ cases will return to the NHS over the coming months.But if 50 per cent seek treatment, and activity continues to grow in line with pre-pandemic plans, the waiting list would reach 12 million by March 2025.If the NHS meets the Government’s target of increasing activity by 10 per cent more than planned, the waiting list would stand at 7 million in 2025.The Government’s new 1.25 per cent hike in national insurance, coming into force in April, will raise an extra £36billion over three years for the NHS and social care.Of this, £8billion will go specifically to addressing the backlog. However, the NAO said it was uncertain whether this funding would be enough to reduce waiting times and address long-term problems in the health service.It noted ‘waiting time performance had been gradually deteriorating’ since 2013 and ‘the pandemic heaped yet more pressure on a care system that was already creaking under the strain’.NHS England data shows that in February 2020, just 83 per cent of patients were seen within the 18-week standard. By last month, this had fallen to 66 per cent.The report said it will be impossible to clear the waiting list unless workforce shortages – of around 100,000 doctors, nurses and other NHS staff – are addressed. It also warned ‘the ongoing pandemic may continue to affect bed and staff availability in unexpected ways and at short notice’.The NAO report said if the backlog is to be cleared, social care needs support so elderly patients do not end up trapped in hospital.Tim Mitchell, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said the projection that waiting lists could hit 12 million was ‘very worrying’ but ‘will not come as a surprise’.He called for the creation of ‘surgical hubs’ to tackle the backlog, adding: ‘Frustrated patients who have been left waiting in pain for hip, knee, heart and other vital operations, want to know there is a plan to reduce waiting times.’A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘NHS staff are now pulling out all the stops to recover elective activity levels, so anyone who is concerned about their health should come forward so the NHS can help you.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"SAGE tells No10 bring fit fly tests vaccinated UK arrivals","story":"Share this article In the minutes, seen by the BBC but yet to be published, SAGE scientists say extra swabs for travellers returning to the UK would be \u0027valuable\u0027. They also stressed how much uncertainty there is around the variant\u0027s transmissibility and effectiveness against vaccines.Ms Cooper slammed ministers for failing to sit up and take notice of advice from their scientists.She said: \u0027It is totally unacceptable that ministers are failing to take action at the border when even their own advisers are telling them to introduce pre-departure tests.\u0027It cannot be right that people can travel to an airport, board a busy flight, queue at busy departure gates, and travel on trains and buses in the UK, all without having taken a test.\u0027The Government must not repeat the mistakes it made earlier in the pandemic by being too slow to take action to prevent further cases of the Omicron variant entering the UK.\u0027Boris Johnson tightened restrictions for arrivals amid concern over the Omicron variant, saying they would slow down its \u0027seeding\u0027 in the UK.But Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have called on the Prime Minister to go further and require all arrivals to quarantine for eight days. Around 78,000 people were arriving in UK airports every day last year, when lockdowns and restrictions slashed air passenger numbers. It is thought to be higher now, although still below the 500,000 arrivals a day registered before the pandemic began. Up to fifty direct flights arrived in the UK from South Africa between the Omicron variant being detected and travel restrictions being imposed.Now anyone coming from the red list country has to go into mandatory hotel quarantine for 11-days at a cost of £2,285. At least six countries in southern Africa have also been slapped with the restrictions. Guidance for un-vaccinated arrivals required them to take a Covid test three days before departure for the UK, and on day two and day eight after their arrival. They must also self-isolate for ten days. For vaccinated travellers they must self-isolate and take a Covid test within two days of their arrival. They can only leave self-isolation when the test is negative. Mr Johnson has also brought face masks back in shops, on public transport, and on school corridors, and said everyone who is a close contact of an Omicron case must self-isolate.But he has faced pressure for restrictions to be further ramped up amid growing concern over the spread of the Omicron variant.Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency, said yesterday that people should avoid socialising in the run up to Christmas.And some experts have called for face masks to be used in classrooms again.People in Scotland have also been told to start working from home where possible to curb the spread of the virus.  Scientists are working at breakneck speed to establish the risk it poses, but they say no concrete results are likely for the next two weeks.Top epidemiologists at the UK Health Security Agency say they need hundreds of cases to be identified before they can make concrete assertions on its transmissibility.Israeli news site Channel 24 suggested yesterday that Omicron may be 1.3 times more infectious than Delta, but they did not provide any data to back up the claim. The Israeli Health Ministry said it did not recognise the claim. Pre-departure Covid tests would be valuable, say Sage scientists - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Festive flights jeopardy plans change test rules","story":"Share this articleNon-U.S. citizen, Non-U.S. immigrants: Air Travel to the United States | CDC"},{"url":null,"title":"Sajid Javid denies PM broke Covid rules parties No10","story":"Share this articleBoris Johnson \u0027broke Covid lockdown rules\u0027 with Downing Street parties at Xmas - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fcaffb5854dafcd8175ea5640137324cbd98e67/221_86_5026_3015/master/5026.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dcd759bb4e8e9a603af4c44bdae803c4","title":"world chess championship game 5 live magnus carlsen v ian nepomniachtchi","story":"Carlsen, who’s spoken on multiple occasions about altering the format, was diplomatic when the question was put to him yesterday. “There’s a saying that if you don’t have anything nice to say, you shouldn’t say anything at all,” he said. “So I’m going to invoke that particular saying right here.” Nepomniachtchi, for his part, was less keen on change. “It’s hard to say because I believe the importance of traditions in chess is really big,” he said. “I guess whatever works you shouldn’t try to make it work better in order not to break it. I believe this system with the matches is more or less fair.”As far as I can tell, the only player to compete in a world championship game that started on his birthday (until Carlsen yesterday and in 2018) was the great William Steinitz in Game 16 of his doomed title defense against Emanuel Lasker on 17 May 1894. It wasn’t his best day.The time control for each game is 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, 60 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 61. Players cannot agree to a draw before black’s 40th move. A draw claim before then is only permitted through the arbiter, if threefold repetition occurs (as occurred in Game 4). If the match is tied after 14 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day (16 December) in the following order: • Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. • If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). • If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death ‘Armageddon’ match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner. Notably, Carlsen’s second and third title defenses both came down to tiebreakers. But many believe the increased length of this year’s match (from 12 to 14 games) and the stylistic matchup at hand promises a decisive result in regulation. The first three games were fighting encounters notable for Carlsen making early material sacrifices in exchange for long-term initiative, demanding extraordinary accuracy from the Russian challenger for him to emerge with a result. Yesterday? Not so much. Carlsen failed to get his teeth into Nepomniachtchi’s Petrov with the rare 18. Nh4!? and the affair fizzled out to a draw after 33 moves and 2hr 37min. “Obviously I would have loved to win, would have loved to find more chances than I did, but I think overall it’s a normal result against a world-prepared opponent.” For those of you just coming aboard, Carlsen, who turned 31 on Tuesday, has been at No 1 in the Fide rankings for 10 straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he dethroned Vishy Anand for the title in 2013. Nepomniachtchi, also 31, is ranked No 5, having earned his place at the table by winning the eight-man candidates tournament in April.  We’re a little more than 40 minutes from today’s first move, so not much longer now."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"foley defends rollout of requirement for children over certain age to wear masks","story":"Dr Tony Holohan: ‘Parents have a key role to play in reducing transmission within and between households.’ Photograph: iStockMinister for Education Norma Foley has defended the manner in which new public health measures that require children from a certain age to wear masks in school and other public settings came into effect.From today, pupils from third class upwards are required to wear face masks in schools, with exemptions for children who can provide a medical certificate.Children aged nine and over are also required to wear masks on public transport and in retail and other indoor public settings under the new Government guidelines.The new measures for children were announced on Tuesday evening and came into effect on Wednesday morning.Some parents, principals and unions have the criticised the fast pace of the move with Ms Foley criticised for the short notice given to schools and parents to implement the new measures.‘Chaotic management’Speaking in the Dáil this morning, the Minister said the measure was being introduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February.“This is a public health measure, it is guided by public health, it is the strong recommendation of the CMO and indeed of Nphet that this is an additional tool for our schools,” the Minister said.Ms Foley said schools “know their children and are best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face masks may not be possible for them”.She said it is expected that schools will take a practical approach over the next day or two in order to communicate the new measures to parents and ensure parents have the opportunity to provide masks to children.She was responding to Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, who said school principals were this morning having to police the wearing of face masks without any lead-up period or “any sense of what the legal implications are if a parent was to refuse”.The party’s education spokesman said the overnight communication from the Department of Education was delivered “with all the subtlety, compassion of a gas bill”.Mr Ó Ríordáin told the Dáil on Wednesday morning that school communities are grappling with “another chaotic management of messaging and leadership” from the Department of Education.Schools have been provided with guidance and information, and more than €700 million has been provided in resources to deal with a variety of infection and prevention control measures, she added.However, Mr Ó Ríordáin said school principals were given 16 hours, after a “classic, soulless communication”, to “get their act together to enforce a diktat” to potentially very anxious children.“You’ve been described, as a Government, as a bad debs committee and that’s the best description I can come up with this morning,” Mr Ó Ríordáin added.In a letter distributed to all primary schools, Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan appealed to parents to follow new public health measures introduced as part of an effort to drive down Covid case numbers in children. He urged parents to reduce social contact between now and the Christmas break.The letter was sent to schools on Tuesday night, and principals have been asked to distribute it to all parents.The decision to introduce masks in schools comes on the back of the latest epidemiological data that shows high rates of infection among five to 11 year olds, who have not yet been vaccinated.Dr Holohan published similar public health messages in relation to primary school children on social media on Tuesday night. There were a substantial number of responses from parents – particularly those of nine-year-olds – who objected to their children wearing masks.He said the National Public Health Emergency Team would review the requirement for children to wear masks in primary school in mid-February.In the letter Dr Holohan said there had been significant and rapid deterioration in the epidemiological situation over a very short time. He said schools are “at the heart of our communities” and play a “fundamental role in the social lives and wellbeing of our children”.“It is therefore imperative that we move quickly as soon as we notice a significant change in incidence,” he wrote.Dr Holohan outlined the new recommendations around avoiding indoor birthday parties, playdates and sleepovers, and indoor community gatherings. He also outlined the updated advice to parents.“I am keenly aware that these measures are not what any of us want to hear, particularly at this time of year. I know this is an additional burden at what has been a very difficult time for all of us, particularly those of us with young families,” he said.“That being said, parents have a key role to play in reducing transmission within and between households.”Dr Holohan acknowledged young children often display respiratory symptoms at this time of year and that it gets “increasingly difficult to isolate and arrange PCR tests repeatedly”, but he said “this remains an essential measure to protect families and the wider community”.“When incidence of disease is as high as it is at the moment across the country, it means that the force of infection is pushed down through the unvaccinated population and into our unvaccinated young children,” Dr Holohan said.“While we know that most in this age group will experience a very mild form of this disease if they pick it up, for a small few, they may become severely ill.”He added: “I am hopeful that if we all make a concerted effort to follow these measures for at least the next two weeks, we can make a real difference to incidence of disease in this cohort and in the wider public.”Development concernsParentline, a charity helpline for parents, said it had received a deluge of calls in recent days from parents who are concerned about the impact of the new restrictions on their children “developmentally and emotionally”.Chief executive of the charity Aileen Hickie said parents understood the importance of keeping schools open, that Covid was spreading rapidly and the need to stem outbreaks, but they were concerned about developmental outcomes especially for children with hearing difficulties or with special needs.Ms Hickie noted the new measures for children were guidelines and school principals had discretion for cases of complex concern, but she said that “once again” the responsibility was on parents to ensure their child wore a mask.Trade union Fórsa said it supports the use of face masks in schools but that the Government’s rush to implement the measure will make it more difficult to achieve.It also said that that responsibility for excluding children from school for non-compliance should rest with school principals and senior teachers rather than special needs assistants (SNAs), school secretaries, and caretakers, all of whom it represents.“The measure shouldn’t have been implemented overnight with no time to build consensus or explain the requirements to students, parents and staff,” said the union’s head of education, Andy Pike.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lack of prompt decision making exhausting public s patience","story":"People queuing at Citywest vaccination centre in Dublin this week.

Photograph: iStockOne case of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 has been found in the Republic from a batch of eight cases that were sequenced, it has been confirmed.The confirmation was provided during a briefing of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Wednesday, and public health officials said the case was identified through “blind luck”.The case involved a person who recently returned from a country in southern Africa, where the new variant was first identified.The person had returned before Ireland imposed travel restrictions on seven countries in southern Africa. The person then developed symptoms which necessitated a PCR test.Outlining the case, Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said he did not have details on the severity of the case.Dr de Gascun said there was “an element of blind luck” involved in the identification of the case, as it was included in a regular 10 per cent sample of all cases that is referred to the laboratory at Backweston each week.Last Friday, a member of staff noticed it was a possible Omicron case and it was sent for genetic sequencing. The result of this process confirmed it as involving the new variant.Seven other cases with S-gene dropout, which can be indicative of Omicron, were found not to involve this variant.Omicron responseThe emergence last week of the new variant, which some experts fear could prove more transmissible, prompted the Government on Friday to impose travel restrictions on passengers from seven southern African countries: South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique. People arriving in Ireland from these countries have to quarantine at home for 10 days after entering the State. Although the number of travellers impacted will be small, the reintroduction of travel restrictions marks a further return to tighter restrictions to bring Covid under control.Travellers from those countries will also have to present a “not-detected” pre-flight PCR test result, regardless of vaccination status, quarantine at home for 10 days and undergo a further two PCR tests. The obligation is backdated for recent arrivals from these countries, who will be traced and contacted using the passenger locator form. The Garda will monitor compliance, initially.Concerns over Omicron and the ongoing high level of Covid cases in the State has led to the Government approving a raft of measures.These measures require travellers into Ireland from any country to show negative PCR or antigen test results, introduce mask-wearing for primary school children from third class upwards and ask parents to limit their children’s socialising.Pandemic powersTwo pieces of legislation – one to extend several Covid powers and one specifically to revive mandatory hotel quarantine if needed – are to be brought to the Dáil and Seanad in the coming days.The mandatory hotel legislation is necessary because those powers have already lapsed, while the other Covid powers – including those concerning masks, hospitality restrictions, Covid certificates, travel restrictions and others – are due to lapse early next year.Officials are currently preparing orders to require travellers into the country to show a negative PCR or antigen test from Friday. There will be “spot checks” at the airport to ensure travellers are compliant, but officials said it would be mostly a matter for airlines and ferry companies to ensure that passengers could show a negative test.The Government is considering fines for carriers that allow people without tests to board, while a spokesman confirmed there would be fines for passengers who could not show a negative test. There will be no checks for travellers from Northern Ireland.

Advent calendars waiting on mantelpieces. The jingle-jangle of sleigh bells on an endless muzak loop. A portly man promising a season of goodwill only for a grisly Covid variant to change everything and No 10’s advice to slip from ho-ho-ho to no-no-no. The crackdown’s first edict is already here. Today, like some unwelcome rehash of a movie you didn’t like the first time round, is Mask Day 2. At 4am today, the new regime dawned, replacing the do-as-you-see-fit attitude that followed “Freedom Day” on July 19 with an order to mask up in shops and on public transport. It had to be masks. There are a host of so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) able to dent Covid, from handwashing and work-from-home directives to full national lockdown. But, of all the options on the menu, none is so isive in Britain as the wearing of masks. None polarises us more, setting very British attitudes at odds with each other: the deferential queue observer against the authority questioner the selfless, polite personality against the robust, self-reliant inidual. It is as though our island’s character has been resolved into contradictions. Indeed on this issue the Union is indeed ided, with different rules in its four constituent parts. Today’s promise is that those who don’t comply will be walloped with a series of £200 fines, which double with each reoffence. But anyone who has seen “enforcement” on the London Underground – where staff themselves wear masks around their chins as canned messages demand passengers muffle up – will know this is likely to be a charade. Instead we must prepare ourselves for the return of that ultimate in British authority: the tutting and eye-rolling of social disapproval. What official force can compare? Other countries may endure anti-lockdown riots directed at the state, but Britain does it differently. From today, my friends, it is not us against them, but us against us as, with pursed lips or defiant stares, we once again begin to police ourselves.Who knows why this devolution of enforcement to the inidual is particular to Britain, but it is. Take a trip to France and you discover a host of measures that seem sensible there but unimaginable here. Want to get on the train? You need a mask and proof of vaccine. Two centuries of statist edicts from the centre make such rules unremarkable. And as for the draconian rules of Spain, or Greece, well it’s easy to forget that both were Right-wing military dictatorships within the last half century. Whereas we, in sometimes self-congratulating style, do cherish the whole Mother of Parliaments bit. And that Parliament is led by a man whose every fibre rebels against the nanny state, even if the pandemic might demand, from time to time, a dose of unpleasant nannying. From the very beginning, the experts at Sage’s behavioural insight subcommittee (Spi-B) were clear that, if the country was not to dissolve in bitter acrimony over masks, strong leadership would be required. “If government is to recommend that the public wear face masks in the community,” it noted on April 20 2020, a month into lockdown one, “there will need to be thorough guidance and communication.” Without it, we would have “heightened public awareness, negative evaluation and harassment of people who are not wearing face masks, leading to ision which could undermine collective solidarity which is helpful for managing the pandemic.”Instead of such clear guidance and communication, however, there was fudge. To begin with, that was not unusual. After all, at the beginning of the pandemic even the WHO considered there was insufficient evidence that masks reduced transmission. But that was when droplets from coughs and surface contact were considered the two main vectors, and the dangers of aerosols – particles hanging around in the air for ages – were largely unrecognised. On May 11 the first recommendations were made in England: the Government advised the use of a face coverings, but only in enclosed spaces, where social distancing was difficult. A month later, they became mandatory on public transport. A month after that, in shops, too. Such off-on requirements were off again this summer, but the ambiguity remained as official advice stated that “you are expected and recommended to continue wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces ... where the risk of transmission is likely to be greater.” Yet as we all know, Tory MPs on the Government benches have almost all abandoned masks, while Labour seem to have a three-line whip enforcing them. Professor Robert West, a psychologist on Spi-B, has warned how confusing this all can be. “People who are ambivalent, it gives them a kind of excuse to say, ‘If they’re not doing it why should I do it?’” The PM, however, prefers nudge to nanny-state. “Nudging” can be highly effective and has certainly informed the decision to market masks as a tool to protect others, as much as (if not more than) to protect oneself. Psychological studies suggest we like people more after doing something nice for them. Social cohesiveness is built on the giving and receiving of favours – like wearing a mask to protect them. As Spi-B noted as long ago as April 2020: “Wearing a face mask could demonstrate that an inidual is concerned for other people’s welfare and is enacting desired social norms around safety and hygiene.”Recently, though, the question has been: “What social norms?” In the early days, evidence of mask effectiveness was inconclusive but the goal to limit the spread of the virus was universal. Before vaccines or treatments we didn’t want to catch it and even thought we might be able to contain it.Now data on masks is much clearer. Observational studies report big reductions in infection (as high as 53 per cent). Two randomised trials, usually considered more reliable, report smaller, but still important, reductions of around 10 per cent. But stopping Covid’s spread is no longer so important to many people. Schools resemble chicken-pox parties, where parents drop off children to get them exposed to the virus, with the aim of better preparing them to fight infection later in life. Who now doesn’t expect to get Covid eventually?The answer, of course, is the elderly and vulnerable. But the fabric of social cohesion is fraying as more and more of us shrug and reconcile ourselves to the endemic nature of the disease. Liberty vs solidarity: the framing of today’s response is inherently political, Right vs Left. And nothing signals that better than a mask. As time has gone on, they have become ever-more like personal political broadcasts on behalf of the wearer. For the last few months, though, like manifestos out of campaign season, they have been largely uncontested. But today, once again, the national edict will freight them with moral significance. Prof David Halpern, chief executive of the Government’s Behavioural Insights Team, known as the Nudge Unit, who also sits on Sage, reckons that “the British are particularly good at this”.For the Government, such social policing has evident benefits: the brazen maskless commuter and the tutting double-masker hate each other, not Whitehall, which avoids becoming the target of widespread public ire. Some might argue that this is a blame-avoidance tactic dressed up as policy. Now, though, we are facing a rewind moment, a potential reset to March 2020. Instead of laissez-faire we are once again instructed to do our best to prevent the spread of the virus. This time, however, we all know from experience we cannot stop it. We can only delay. What price we are each prepared to pay to do that, after 18 months, is anyone’s guess. Government nudgers – long amazed by how compliant we’ve all been – may once again find themselves astonished and delighted. The risk is, of course, that the silent social self-regulation of British people finally gives way, and the phony war between Mask On-ers and Mask Off-ers collapses into open hostility.More from News Politics latest news: Boris Johnson says no rules were broken at \u0026#39boozy\u0026#39 parties last yearThree Covid vaccine doses \u0026#39enough to protect against omicron variant\u0026#39, early research suggestsCovid latest news: Vaccine passports have no impact on reducing infections, experts warnTurkey acts to support plunging lira for first time in seven yearsThree injured at Munich train station after \u0026#39World War II aerial bomb\u0026#39 explodesWith each new set of restrictions, Britain moves further away from its traditions of libertyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"forget omicron should call xi variant","story":"The naming of Covid variants, like the naming of cats, is a difficult matter. If you’re the World Health Organisation, anyway. Apparently keen to avoid giving offence, they’ve been working their way through the Greek alphabet so quickly that “luxury watch company suing WHO for trademark infringement” headlines are probably imminent. For in classifying the latest variant of concern as “omicron”, the WHO skipped two letters – “nu”, supposedly to “avoid confusion with the word ‘new’”, and “xi” – to, in their words, “avoid stigmatising a region”.It is a curious decision which throws up more questions than it answers. What are we going to do when we’ve run out of Greek letters? Switch to Cyrillic, Babylonian or Cuneiform, or move towards college fraternity style hyphenation (stand by for the “Phi Kappa Delta variant”)? But it’s telling, too. The affair exudes a sense of subservience, even pre-emptive self-censorship. Did anyone actually ask the WHO to do this? Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, may be a powerful man but he is not yet, to my knowledge, a geographical region. And given Beijing’s culpability in the pandemic, if a new variant deserved to be named after anyone, it’s him.This may seem a minor quibble, yet the thinking sums up much of what got us here in the first place, and transcends the WHO. The West excels at ignoring the dragon in the room on a host of issues, often without even being told to. Reporters blanched when Donald Trump described Covid-19 as the “China virus” at the start of the pandemic, and a similar cowardice masquerading as sensitivity has stifled discussion ever since.I’ve recently finished the brilliant Viral by Matt Ridley and Alina Chan. This bold investigation into the origins of Covid-19 also reveals a shameful wall of institutional silence on this most vital of questions. Circumstantial evidence that the virus emerged from a lab was largely ignored while those who tried to investigate it were silenced or smeared as conspiratorial cranks. That we can discuss it comparatively freely today owes more to a handful of whistleblowers and internet sleuths than it does to any established scientific agency.This month, meanwhile, Disney+ launched in Hong Kong. Disney has owned the rights to the cartoon series The Simpsons for years, yet eagle-eyed fans in the former British colony soon noticed they’d quietly omitted something – a 2005 episode in which the family travels to Beijing to help Aunt Selma adopt a Chinese baby. The episode, a late-season highlight, fizzes with lacerating satire. Their adoption agent says to bookworm Lisa at one point: “Soon you will have a little Chinese sister who will surpass you academically”. “Oh I don’t know. I’m considered pretty smart, replies Lisa. “Well Tibet used to be considered pretty independent”, counters the agent. “How’d that work out?” At Tiananmen Square the family spots a placard that reads: “On this site, in 1989, nothing happened”. With even this telling nod to history excised, we’ve moved beyond irony.Again, it’s not obvious whether it was the result of instruction or self-censorship, but neither should surprise us. This is, after all, the same Disney that chose to film parts of its live-action remake of Mulan in Xinjiang Province, the site of Uyghur internment camps, starring an actress who came out to support the Chinese government on the crackdown in Hong Kong.One notable recent exception to the wall-of-silence rule of public life is the Women’s Tennis Association, which has repeatedly slammed the shocking disappearance of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai. But the WTA is in the minority even among sporting bodies a senior Olympic official participated in feeble televised interview with Peng, seemingly designed to allay public outrage ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Then there is the fiction of “Chinese Taipei”, a bogus and misleading term of national status foisted on Taiwanese athletes by the International Olympic Committee to make their participation acceptable to China.The new head of MI6 has warned of China’s use of “debt traps” to buy global influence loaning money to smaller, poorer states, then calling in these loans on harsh terms if they are left unpaid – or simply if the country decides to oppose Chinese interests in some way. Too busy gloating over the apparent downfall of the West, liberal thinkers seem unable to identify this practice for what it is – an aggressive form of modern-day colonialism.This has been particularly striking in the case of Barbados and its shift from monarchy to republic. Naturally, the right-on commentators focused on slavery, reparations, the ills of the British empire, and so on, rather than the fact that the island has received large amounts of Chinese “investment”. You have to wonder whether they are ignorant of, or just unconcerned by, the fact that something much less benign is waiting in the wings.As China expands its odious reach around the globe, we seem unable to react, except with silence, or a pathetic misdiagnosis of the problem. How can we begin to counter the enemy we face, when we can barely find the words to describe it?More from News Politics latest news: Boris Johnson says no rules were broken at \u0026#39boozy\u0026#39 parties last yearThree Covid vaccine doses \u0026#39enough to protect against omicron variant\u0026#39, early research suggestsCovid latest news: Vaccine passports have no impact on reducing infections, experts warnTurkey acts to support plunging lira for first time in seven yearsThree injured at Munich train station after \u0026#39World War II aerial bomb\u0026#39 explodesWith each new set of restrictions, Britain moves further away from its traditions of libertyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new set restrictions britain moves away traditions liberty","story":"Parliament debated and voted on the latest set of coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday, but only after they had come into force. The country now faces at least three weeks of masks in shops and on buses and new self-isolation requirements that could go on for months. Perhaps most costly, those flying into Britain will now have to take a PCR test, rather than the much cheaper lateral flow tests. This latter development, it must be said, has been exposed to the least scrutiny in Parliament. Each of these measures can be debated on the basis of whether they are likely to be useful tools in slowing the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. They should also be tested as to whether the loss of freedom for British citizens is proportionate to any benefit they might bring. But for me, they pose a bigger question: what do they say about the kind of society we have become? Let us take a step back and survey the wreckage of the last couple of years. In March 2020, we were told that we would all be locked down for three weeks while NHS capacity was increased to cope with coronavirus. Three months later the lockdown was still in place. We then went through a hokey-cokey of restrictions for another year until we were told that the vaccines were riding to the rescue. At every turn of this story, we as a nation move away from our centuries-old traditions of liberty and respect for the rights of people to make decisions over our own lives. An authoritarian habit of imposing binding restrictions doesn’t just take away our freedom to do as we please but also takes away our responsibility towards other people. In essence, it makes us all lose some humanity.The restrictions have also knocked hell out of some of our most important industries, with our world-leading aviation sector possibly suffering the most. Even when the Soviet-style ban on leaving the country was scrapped, a complex, expensive and ever-changing list of other requirements was put in place to deter people from travelling. Thousands of jobs have been destroyed, families have been kept apart and less affluent people have been largely excluded from international travel. Meanwhile the evidence has mounted that closing borders has not stopped variants of coronavirus from spreading around the world. When Australia and New Zealand exercised a policy of almost entirely shutting their borders, the delta variant still became the predominant variant there too. The only benefit of the millions of PCR tests taken by Brits returning from green and amber list countries in the summer was to prove that they were actually less likely to have coronavirus than people who had stayed at home.In September, it looked as if there was light at the end of the tunnel when cheaper, easier to take lateral flow tests replaced the pricey rigmarole that had gone before. Passenger numbers started to creep back up but nonetheless remained a fraction of what we saw pre-pandemic. And now, instead of building on that progress, the Government has returned to expensive tests (and self-isolation pending the result), extended the number of countries on the red list and moved back to quarantine hotels for people flying from them. Flying has once again become a rich man’s game — too tricky a venture for the millions hoping to visit family or take a break in the sun. In the interests of fairness and to help sustain the recovery of a fragile sector, the Government must take urgent action to make sure that testing is affordable (or free) and that results are rapid.Sir Graham Brady is the Member of Parliament for Altrincham and Sale West.More from News Politics latest news: Boris Johnson says no rules were broken at \u0026#39boozy\u0026#39 parties last yearThree Covid vaccine doses \u0026#39enough to protect against omicron variant\u0026#39, early research suggestsCovid latest news: Vaccine passports have no impact on reducing infections, experts warnTurkey acts to support plunging lira for first time in seven yearsThree injured at Munich train station after \u0026#39World War II aerial bomb\u0026#39 explodesWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bexley election hopeful says voters","story":"Exclusive: Bexley by-election hopeful says voters turning away from Tories in \"disgust\"Labour candidate Daniel Francis says Conservative supporters staying at home and others switching sides could deliver an unlikely victoryDaniel Francis is Labours candidate for this weeks poll Image: Daily MirrorByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Nov | comments TORY voters are turning away from Boris Johnson in “disgust” at Conservative sleaze and the cost of living crisis, Labour ’s hopeful for Thursdayaposs Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election told the Mirror.Peppa Pig has also been cited as a reason why voters will not back the Prime Minister’s candidate at the ballot box.But Labour’s Daniel Francis admitted winning the seat from the Tories’ -year grip and where they are defending an , majority would be “a dficult path, we don’t underestimate that”.

Mr Francis, a dad of eight-year old twin girls, decided to launch his bid to oust the Conservatives from this South East London stronghold on the Kent border after being persuaded by we Emma, a teacher, and parents at the school gates.“Iaposm standing because I had a broad consensus of Labour Party members plus Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters at my daughters’ school gates encouraging me to stand, saying, ‘If you do, we will vote Labour’.“Those conversations made me believe I could bring together a cross-section of people who normally wouldnapost vote Labour, along with those who do vote Labour.  “Those people at the school gates have been natural Conservatives but theyaposre really not happy with what is happening with public services and believe that I was the person that could be arguing for the right direction in Parliament.” Anger at the Government ranges from the failure to tackle rising gas and food prices to Tory sleaze. “People have been talking about bread and butter issues - cost of living, high streets, policing, cuts the Conservative council has made,” said Mr Francis. “But during the course of the campaign, people’s perceptions have changed about the Prime Minister and about the sleaze that has been surrounding this Government.” While realistic about their chances of winning the seat, Labour canvassers have been buoyed by doorstep reactions. Some traditional Conservatives have volunteered they will not back the party’s candidate Louie French - blaming the Prime Minister.  Mr Francis added: “People have looked at the performance of both the main party leaders and seen who they believe is competent and in control of events and concluded that isn’t the Prime Minister, and that under Keir’s leadership they want to look at the Labour Party again and give us another chance.”Tories who defend Mr Johnson point to his electoral successes - twice winning the London mayoralty, leading the Brexit campaign and steering the Tories to their -seat majority at the  general election.But Mr Francis believes the magic has worn off - and Peppa Pig may have played a role. The PM was widely mocked for talking about the cartoon character during a speech to business leaders last month.“When Boris Johnson was the Mayor of London here, he had a very large personal vote and popular appeal,” said Mr Francis. “But one of the key issues people cite as the main reason they are defecting to Labour is the Peppa Pig speech.” He added: “The Prime Minister has clearly become unpopular here and is being cited as a liability. “I’ve had someone who was a Conservative member until last year tell me he had left the party and was voting Labour in disgust.” Labour insiders concede it will probably not be enough to beat the Tories, but they are confident of cutting the Conservative majority. Mr Francis hopes voters will flock to Labour - boosting the party’s hopes nationally. Fuelling hopes Mr Starmer’s leadership will revive Labouraposs fortunes, he cited the midpoint of Tory PM John Major’s reign, when voters were turning to Labour.  “I’ve been in the Labour Party since , I first knocked a door when John Smith was leader,” he said. “I think people are looking at us in a similar vein to that period in our history, that we are beginning a path after a period when we did have a dficult time, of moving back to the people and electability.”Asked about Jeremy Corbyn ’s ongoing influence on voters, he said: “Some people still have that period in their memories, some people feel we have moved on. “Clearly we will see what the result is on Thursday, but there will be a path that some people need a longer time to look back at that period in our history and think that we have changed. “But they are seeing on a number of issues how the party is moving on. “We are moving back to the centre ground and to where the main thrust of the British people are.” What are voters saying Voters on Bexley High Street today made clear their unease with the Tories - and some pledged their support for Labour, while others had advice for Keir Starmer.But they all expected the Conservatives to win on Thursday. Eva Seeley, , a retired estate agent, said: “I’m going to be voting Labour. I have always voted Labour and I’m not very happy with the Government at the moment - I think Boris isn’t doing a very good job.  “Keir Starmer is doing OK. He’s a bright man but he needs a bit more charisma. “I don’t think Labour will win but they might cut the majority.” Susan Berry, , a retired hospitality manager for Lehman Brothers, said: “I will stick with what I always stick with - the Conservatives. “I’m not % happy with the Conservative Party at the moment, but I won’t vote for the alternative.“Labour don’t say anything positive about what they would do - solutions instead of criticisms. “I think Boris has had a bit of a rough ride, myself.” Ashley Johnson, , a plumber, said: “I didn’t know the by-election was taking place.  “I don’t really follow politics but I know a bit about Boris - I don’t think he’s really the best. “He’s more for the rich class. For the working and middle class people, he doesnapost really help them. “I would probably vote Labour, but I would like to know more about Keir Starmer. “I reckon he should help out the people who are working class - not tax them so much, bring living costs down, rent and things like that. “That’s how to help normal people.” John Bowerman, , a pensioner, said: “I’m voting Labour, I always do - but it’s a waste of time.  “The Tories - they could put up a pig in lipstick and they would win here.” Sarah Spencer, , a finance manager, said: “I haven’t seen anything from the Lib Dems through the door - so much Conservative stuff! “If there’s a Lib Dem then definitely I’m voting for them - I’ve always been a Lib Dem supporter, I just wish there was more activity from them in the area, they need to be more vocal.  “Unfortunately, it’s a Conservative borough and has been for a long time. But I think there should be some change.” Whataposs the constituency like  Old Bexley and Sidcup is in South East London suburbia and borders Kent. The constituency was created in  and former Prime Minister Ted Heath held the seat until . It has only ever had Conservative MPs in its -year history and the closest Labour has come to winning was in  when the Tory majority was cut to just , - when Heath retired.  Labour has come second at the last eight general elections. The Liberals came second in  and . James Brokenshire became the MP in  and his majority at the December  poll was ,. His death in early October from lung cancer triggered Thursdayaposs by-election. The seat is in the “doughnut” of outer-London boroughs where the Tories and Liberal Democrats are often successful, whereas Labour’s support traditionally lies in the capital’s inner-city seats.No-one expects Daniel Francis to win but the party would face criticismit failed to cut the Conservative majority, on what is expected to be a low turnout.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON James BrokenshireJohn SmithLabour PartyLiberal DemocratsConservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Today Boris Johnsonset a target of offering a booster to all those eligible “by the end of January”. That’s more than million boosters in just nine weeks.The best chance of a normal Christmas with our loved ones is to roll up our sleeves, Sajid Javid told the press conference. It’s hard-pressed NHS staff who have to roll their sleeves most of all - with troops also being called in to help. Here’s what you need to know about the latest announcements.Who is eligible for a booster All adults in the UK are now eligible for a Covid booster vaccine - Pfizer or Moderna. Previously all over-s and people with certain health conditions were being offered a third dose. On Monday that was extended to all over-s following a rapid review by the JCVI. This was to give the population further protection in the face of the Omicron iant. The question is now how it’s delivered.What is the gap between doses At the same time, the JCVI halved the minimum gap between second and third doses from six months to three months. While immunity is said to be better with a six-month gap, the JCVI weighed that up against the risks of waiting too long with a new iant. So, can I get a booster jab now No, not necessarily. Taken together, the two changes suddenly made tens of millions of people eligible for a booster jab overnight. That means there is not enough capacity for everyone to get their jab straight away and they must book in a prioritised way. Under-s can’t book in yet because the UK Health Security Agency is still updating a Patient Group Directive, Green Book and National Protocol. This is expected to change in the coming days, though the NHS has not set a firm timetable. Boris Johnson said: “Evenyou have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please donapost try and book until the NHS says it is your turn.What order will people be offered a booster Boris Johnson confirmed: “As with the first jabs, we will be working through people by age group going down in five-year bands. “It is vital that the older and the more clinically vulnerable get that added protection first.” That means those aged - will be offered the booster, followed by -, then -, - and under-. In practice the booking system was known to open up to one year group at a time earlier this year. Those already eligible at the top of the list were people in residential care homes over-s frontline health and care workers and under-s with under-s with underlying health conditions and adults who share a household with immunosuppressed people. How will the NHS ramp up capacity Boris Johnson said England will have more than , community pharmacy sites, “all of” which will increase capacity. Shut-down “hospital hubs” will be reactivated and temporary vaccination centres will be “popping up like Christmas trees”, he claimed. As with the first rollout, troops will help. “We will deploy at least  military personnel to assist the efforts of our NHS”, the PM said. NHS England chief Amanda Pritchard said mobile vaccination units would do some of the work for hard-to-reach communities. But she added: “It can’t happen overnight, particularly given the other pressures facing NHS staff who are working extremely hard”. Is the January  target achievable The new target announced by Boris Johnson will force NHS chiefs to hugely ramp up the speed of booster jabs. Overall .million people have had a second dose while .million have had a booster or third dose. That leaves .millon who still need a booster by the end of January. With nine weeks to go, that means the NHS would have to average more than .million boosters a week - or more than .millionit took a week off over Christmas. Currently there is an average of around .million doses per week.

Notes from a meeting on Monday, obtained by the BBC, say it is “highly likely” that the multiple-mutated strain can resist vaccine immunity “to some extent”, like the Delta iant does.The notes add: Any signicant reduction in protection against infection could still result in a very large wave of infections. “This would in turn lead to a potentially high number of hospitalisations even with protection against severe disease being less affected. It comes after Boris Johnson last night insisted a Christmas lockdown was extremely unlikely. A government spokesman did not deny the minutes were genuine and warned: “We continue to monitor the situation closely and will not hesitate to take further actionnecessary.”  The leaked say it would be “valuable” to go further on travel testing, forcing travellers to the UK to take a pre-departure Covid test before they take their flight. Currently travellers from non-red-list countries will only need to take a Day  test after arrival and isolate until it comes back negative. The leaked SAGE minutes said this approach will “identy signicantly fewer cases than an additional test on either day five or day eight - as the Welsh and Scottish governments have called for. Scientists simply do not know at the moment whether Omicron -  cases of which have been found in the UK so far - is resistant to vaccines.  Face mask laws and mandatory -day isolation for close contacts of suspected Omicron cases have been introduced for three weeks - and could be extended beyond December  - while scientists work out the risk.Health Secretary Sajid Javid today said people “maybe” want to take a lateral flow test before going to Christmas parties. But he rejected comments of government advisor Dr Jenny Harries who suggested people may want to cut down on socialising. Mr Javid agreed with Boris Johnson, saying there is no need to cancel plans.And Mr Javid claimed the restrictions “might” be reviewed earlier than the planned three-week review date on December . We are confident that actually maybe within two weeks we will know a lot more about this. We may not even need to wait three weeks, he said.  The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesnotes said the size of any future wave remains highly uncertain, according to the BBC. But the scientists added it may be of a scale that requires very stringent response measures to avoid unsustainable pressure on the NHS. They went on: It is important to be prepared for a potentially very signicant wave of infections with associated hospitalisations now, ahead of data being available… The situation could develop quickly over the coming weeks and decision makers may need to act while there is a high level of uncertainty including the potential need for stringent response measures.” The minutes obtained by the BBC have not been seen by the Mirror. However, SAGE minutes are published regularly by the government including on most Fridays. A government spokesperson said: “As soon as we became aware of the Omicron iant we took rapid action to protect public health - including expanding the red list, introducing PCR testing for travellers, changing the rules on self-isolation for close contacts and mandating face coverings in shops and on public transport. “On top of this we are speeding up our vaccination programme by offering all adults in England a booster jab by the end of January, halving the gap between second doses and boosters, and offering second jabs to - year olds, following advice from the JCVI. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: “It is totally unacceptable that Ministers are failing to take action at the border when even their own advisors are telling them to introduce pre-departure tests. “It cannot be right that people can travel to an airport, board a busy flight, queue at busy departure gates, and travel on trains and buses in the UK, all without having taken a test. “The government must not repeat the mistakes it made earlier in the pandemic by being too slow to take action to prevent further cases of the Omicron iant entering the UK.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Adam Wagner, Visiting Professor of Law at Goldsmiths University of London who has analysed Covid laws, said organisers of such an event could have faced a £, fine while attendees could have been fined £.It comes after the Mirror revealed Boris Johnson and his Downing Street staff were accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at No. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November  when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown, sources told the Mirror. Then on December , with London in tier  restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. Scroll down for the full legal opinion and join the debate in the comments.  Downing Street did not deny the events were held, but a spokesman said: “Covid rules have been followed at all times.” Mr Wagner, however, said only “permitted organised gatherings” or those “reasonably necessary for work” would have been allowed at the time. In an analysis for the Mirror, he wrote: “It seems doubtful that any kind of party, held for over  people indoors where Covid was more likely to spread, would be reasonably necessary for work. “A court looking at this would probably take into account the fact that official guidance from  November said ‘[a]lthough there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier’.  “This strongly suggests that primarily social work Christmas parties would not be permitted under the rules – and a court would not be sympatheticthe party was organised by the politicians who made the rules in the first place. “At the time, anyone who held, or was involved in the holding” of an illegal gathering over  people indoors would potentially have committed a criminal offence. They could be charged or given a £, fixed penalty notice. “People who attended illegal gatherings also potentially committed criminal offences or could be given fixed penalty notices of £.” Sources told the Mirror officials knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home. Around “ or ” people were said to have been crammed “cheek by jowl” into a medium-sized room in Number  for each of the two events. “It was a Covid nightmare,” one source claimed.Health Secretary Sajid Javid - who was not in the government or No during that time period - today claimed he was “absolutely certain all the rules around the pandemic would have been followed.”He attempted to raise questions around the accuracy of the Mirror’s reporting, but decline to actually claim it was inaccurate. Askedthe gatherings happened, he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “Whatever would’ve happened in No throughout the pandemic, I’m absolutely certain all the rules around the pandemic would have been followed.“Obviously I can’t tell you what’s going on on a daily basis in any building, butit’s government and especially No all the rules would have been followed at all times.” He added: “You’re assuming that the news report you’re referring to is accurate, and I’m sure you would have come across inaccurate news reports in the past.” But askedhe was certain it’s inaccurate, he replied: “I can tell you all rules would have been followed at all times.” Top barrister’s opinion in fullBy Adam Wagner, Barrister and Visiting Professor of Law, Goldsmiths University of LondonThe lockdown laws changed regularly last Winter and it was sometimes dficult to keep up. From  November to  December we were in a national lockdown. From  December, the “three tiers” were introduced. The “leaving party” was during the national lockdown law which applied from  November to  December. The  December “Christmas party” was whilst London was in “Tier ”, the highest level of restrictions at the time. During that period there were only two legal ways to have an indoor gathering of more than  people. There were “permitted organised gatherings”, but that would mean guests weren’t allowed to mingle with anyone not in their household. That doesn’t seem to apply here. The only other legal route wasthe gathering was “reasonably necessary for work”. It seems doubtful that any kind of party, held for over  people indoors where Covid was more likely to spread, would be reasonably necessary for work. A court looking at this would probably take into account the fact that official guidance from  November said “[a]lthough there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier”. This strongly suggests that primarily social work Christmas parties would not be permitted under the rules – and a court would not be sympatheticthe party was organised by the politicians who made the rules in the first place. At the time, anyone who held, or was involved in the holding” of an illegal gathering over  people indoors would potentially have committed a criminal offence. They could be charged or given a £, fixed penalty notice. People who attended illegal gatherings also potentially committed criminal offences or could be given fixed penalty notices of £.

The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryne Stone has launched a formal investigation, after it was alleged the Commons leader had failed to properly declare loans to his company. An update to the Commissioneraposs website, published today, said Mr Rees-Mogg was under investigation over the aposregistration of an interest under Category  of the Guide to the Rulesapos - adding that it was related to aposemployment and earningsapos. The site does not specy what the investigation relates to.But it comes after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner wrote to the independent adviser on ministersapos interests, Lord Geidt, over a series of loans to Mr Rees-Moggaposs company Saliston Limited, between  and . In her letter, revealed by the Mirror last week, she said that failing to declare directoraposs loans worth £.m a year allowed Mr Rees-Mogg to borrow a large sum of money at a very low interest rate.She added: The financial benefit to Mr Rees-Mogg in this transaction is the dference in the interest he paid on this loan compared to a loan that he could take out on the open market from another provider, for example a bank. In this transaction, this dference is the value of the financial benefit transferred to Mr Rees-Mogg, which is a financial interest that should have been declared.  Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to £.m a year in directoraposs loans from his firm Saliston Ltd between  and . Although it does not specically identy directoraposs loans, the MPaposs code of conduct requires directors to declare taxable expenses, allowances and benefits. The Leader of the House of Commons stated that he was an unremunerated director and shareholder of the firm but did not mention he had taken out the loans. By using directoraposs loans he was able to borrow the large sum at very low interest rates.  UK company Saliston Ltd has previously been described as a holding company by Mr Rees-Mogg, with £m property assets, understood to include a Mayfair house. Saliston also has a stake in asset management firm Somerset Capital Management LLP, which Mr Rees-Mogg co-founded. He paid just £, interest to Saliston on £m of loans over three years, a rate of just .%. The deputy Labour leader and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pointed to a section of the ministerial code which says that ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise.

Under new rules that came into force on Tuesday, everyone who comes in contact with someone suspected of having the Omicron iant must self-isolate for ten days - eventheyaposre fully vaccinated. If they donapost, they face a fine of £, rising to £, for multiple repeat offences. While other Covid rules will be reviewed by December , the law underpinning the isolation rules will not expire until March . That does not necessarily mean the system will remain in place until then, but Tory MPs have voiced fury.  Tory Huw Merriman told the Commons: If the aim is for us to be covered for no longer than is necessary, why do they have no end date and default to  March The impact of these regulations is even greater than our having to wear a face covering for longer periods because, as has been mentioned, we could well be back to “pingdemic” territory.Tory Andrew Murrison added: The fact is that motion  on the Order Paper expires on  December, yet motion  expires on  March . Can she [the minister] explain the logicality of that Covid rules are due to be reassessed by the Government in three weeks time - just before Christmas. If the threat from Omicron, which some fear may people able to evade the vaccine, is considered to be lessened, then the rules may be eased.In Parliament  Tories voted against the new isolation rules, including the former Cabinet ministers Greg Clark, Jeremy Wright and Esther McVey, as well as Mark Harper, the former chief whip.  Sir Christopher Chope, a Conservative MP who made headlines last month by forcing a debate on whether Owen Paterson should be suspended, criticised the isolation plan.He said the regulations were “part of a scaremongering propaganda campaign that is really designed to restrict or stop interaction between social animals ”.Other MPs told thethat they were concerned the rules would lead to a pandemic and people cancelling Christmas parties to avoid going into isolation. At his press conference today the PM told Brits not to cancel Christmas plans - and stressed there is no immediate lockdown threat.  Boris Johnson said he wanted to take a balanced and proportionate approach to omicron, which has now seen confirmed UK cases rise to .There are  in England, with nine in London. His intervention came after the head of the UK’s Health Security Agency, Dr Jenny Harries, urged people not to socialisethey do not need to in the run-up to Christmas. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said uncertainty caused by such remarks was “extremely frustrating”. He said: “At the very moment operating costs are at their highest, we are now faced with another poorly conceived communications strategy from Government which has and will severely impact businesses. “Christmas bookings and advance ticket sales have already been hit following the announcement of the new Omicron iant. “The Government needs to recognise that, while restrictions are not in place for the hospitality and night-time economy sectors, we are reliving the moments of March  where the Prime Minister asked people not to go to pubs, bars, clubs and theatres. “It is surreal and extremely frustrating to see healthcare advisers publicly telling people not to socialise, giving unnecessary uncertainty to our customers and workforce.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonChristopher ChopePoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So what exactly is changing and how will it affect you  Here are all your questions answered.Where will I need to wear a face mask Face masks are mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices from am on Tuesday. They will also be compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. But masks will not be mandatory in pubs and restaurants, or cinemas and theatres, like they were before. Government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, but this is not a legal requirement. What are the new foreign travel rules From am on Tuesday, all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world must take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Ten African countries were added to England’s red list over the weekend, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. The  nations are Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Those who breach isolation rules can be fined between £ and £,. When will I have to self-isolate All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status.Those affected will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace. It’s not thought the Covid- app will single out those who have to isolate.Elsewhere, people travelling to the UK must self-isolate until their Day  test is negative - as above. People who test positive for Covid must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of vaccine status. And unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated close contacts of a Covid case must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of whether it’s the Omicron iant.Who will get a booster vaccine - and when All adults in the UK will now be offered a Covid booster vaccine - Pfizer or Moderna - in a much shorter time period than before. Third doses will be fast-tracked, with people able to get them three months instead of six months after their second dose. While immunity is said to be better with a six-month gap, the JCVI watchdog weighed that up against the risks of waiting too long with a new iant. However, people will have to wait for their place in the queue. Boosters will be offered in descending order of age in five-year brackets. So -year-olds may have to wait a while. Downing Street was unable to say how long the booster rollout will take. No hopes to see a more detailed timetable published by NHS England “in the coming days”. People should not yet go online and try to booktheyaposre . Meanwhile --year-olds will be offered a second dose. Will schools shut early for Christmas Since Monday, the government is “strongly advising” school pupils above year , staff, and visitors to wear face coverings in communal areas of England’s schools. Local public health teams can send groups of pupils home as a last-ditch measure to stop the spread. But No insisted schools will not shut early for Christmas this year. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said the Government will keep schools open until they had absolutely no choice but to close the institutions down. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People do not need by law to wear masks or show a vaccine passport in hospitality venues. Health Minister Edward Argar said the government will let people in England “use their judgments” about whether to attend festive bashes this year. But the minister also warned people “will reflect carefully on how they are going to react” to the new iant. Voluntary government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, and take a lateral flow test before socialising with other people. Why are these restrictions being introduced Scientists are alarmed by the Omicron iant because it has more than  mutations, which potentially means it could resist the vaccine. Therefore, the government is introducing restrictions to buy time for scientists to work out whether it’s as bad as they fear. At the moment, No admitted, “no one has any hard evidence of its impact on things like hospitalisations”. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said scientists must get live samples of the Omicron virus and test them, asking the public: Please, everyone needs to give us time to assemble that data.He added: “I’m asking people not to panic - but I’m not asking them either to completely ignore the weather forecast.” Are the rules strong enough to work Several key figures say they are not. Labour’s Angela Rayner called for mask mandates to also apply to pubs and other hospitality settings, when people are moving around. She added: “Itaposs so important that people wear masks when theyaposre indoors, in arenas where theyaposre meeting people and... mixing in large numbers.”Scotland and Wales’ First Ministers wrote to Boris Johnson demanding all UK arrivals isolate for eight days, with PCR tests on day  and day . Currently they’ll only have to isolate until a Day  test comes back negative. Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted his approach was “proportionate”. Will the rules be tightened further It is possible. Boris Johnson has not yet enacted all of England’s ‘Plan B’ measures, leaving vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums in reserve. The government has also not advised people in England to work from home where possible, despite advice of that kind in Scotland. Askedthe Government might tighten up England’s rules even further in the next three weeks, minister Edward Argar said: Itaposs not something Iaposm anticipating. But the PM’s spokesman did not rule out tighter travel rules. No said Boris Johnson was not “planning” to adopt Scotland and Wales’ plea for eight days’ isolation, but did not rule it out, saying the response would be kept under review.When will they expire The measures will last three weeks and expire on December , with a review ahead of that. That means they could be ended, continued or strengthened in time for Christmas. MPs will also get a vote on the measures on Tuesday.

We were at the theatre, to see a show my son had been learning about at school, a super special early Christmas treat.Behind us were five women in their thirties who, from the off, talked, and not even in stage ­whispers only during the big musical numbers. They chatted at the top of their voices throughout, as though they were at home in front of the telly rather than surrounded by people, and being incredibly rude to the performers on stage a few feet away. Half-way through the second act, I snapped. Although that makes it sound much more impressive than it was, because obviously I just meekly and incredibly Britishly pleaded with them to be quiet. Please. Thank you. Sorry. It did not go well. I was stupid for trying. What did I think they were going to say, “We had no idea we were disturbing you, please accept our apologies ”  Of course not. They knew they were being loud. They didn’t care. It reminded me of whenever I’ve seen anybody ask someone to wear a mask. The last time, it ended with the personanswering the polite, reasonable request with, “You f***king bitch, mind your own business”.The irony of saying that about a global pandemic – by definition, everyone’s business – seemingly lost here.Now there’s a potentially serious new iant, so we’re being asked to do something. The something that a worldwide study found to be the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid. Wear a mask.  The reaction to this small ask, and my uncomfortable theatre experience, has left me with a depressing realisation. We’re not living in a Me First society. We’re living in a Me Me Me Me First society. This was impossible to ignore thanks to the amount of maskless people going about their business on Monday – in shops, on public transport , everywhere. They knew the mandate was coming into effect the following day, and why, but still they refused to take part in the communal effort to save Christmas – and, you know, lives – until there was no other option. Admittedly the messaging has been insane over the last few months. There will be some who think you must not need to wear a maskthe man with the most important job in the UK doesn’t. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. But there are others who know this isn’t the case, but don’t want to wear masks, so they just… don’t. Similar to the kind of person who feels like chatting loudly in a theatre, so just… does. Apart from no one diespeople talk in a theatre. The truth is that there are a lot of utterly selfish iniduals out there. We see it on a larger scale with rich countries not doing enough to supply vaccines to poorer ones because they’re too worried about themselves. And what gets lost is that helping them is the best thing we can dowe’re worried about ourselves, becauseeveryone’s vaccinated, spread is reduced and iants less likely to develop. We all need to look out for each other, with masks, with sharing vaccines, with compassion. Only then is there hope for us all.

New offences would force prison terms on activists who lock, chain or glue themselves to railings, gates or other objects. That could have seen a jail term for Will Young, the Pop Idol singer who padlocked himself to the gates of a puppy breeding facility earlier this month. The last-minute amendments would also impose six months’ jail on activists who “wilfully” obstruct highways or the construction of major works like HS. Courts would get powers to impose “prevention orders” on protesters’ future behaviour, eventhey’re not convicted of a crime. And police would get sweeping new powers to stop and search protesters, even without suspicion a crime was committed.  Ms Patel claimed the laws were to crack down on groups like Insulate Britain - but opponents said the effect will be far-reaching.She said: “We have seen some of the most self-defeating and dangerous protests ever seen in recent years with people gluing themselves to roads and locking themselves to vehicles and buildings, causing serious disruption to the law-abiding majority across the country. “These are selfish actions which drain the police of resources.” But Liberty has warned the laws “restrict and criminalise protest” on top of measures already agreed in the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill. Even before the new amendments, the Bill will already make it illegal to inflict “serious annoyance” on a person without reasonable excuse, with up to  years’ jail in theoryjudges choose. Existing measures also include imposing up to  years’ jail on people who vandalise statues - up from three months. And the Bill will create new offences against obstructing the road or using a loudspeaker at the gates of Parliament. Tory ministers tabled and withdrew the new amendments last week. Today they are being re-tabled in the Lords for a vote. There is anger because they will not receive detailed Commons scrutiny, only a ‘ping-pong’ vote by MPs in a short debate. Opposition peers last week accused the Home Office of a “naked attack on civil liberties” in a midnight debate. Lib Dem peer Lord Paddick, a former senior Met Police officer, said the “outrageous proposals” introduced “in a wholly unacceptable way at the last minute”. Labour frontbencher Lord Kennedy condemned Insulate Britain tactics but added: “This is no way to do business.”He added: “Although we are responding to one particularly crass protest, the law being debated would not just apply to that one crass protest but all peaceful protests.” Pressing the Government to temper the measures, he said: I think at the moment they are totally unacceptable”. The Home Office pointed out it cost the Met Police nearly £m to police Insulate Britain protests in less than a month to October .

So-called pushbacks are not the solution to curbing the number of desperate people trying to reach Britain and would do the opposite of what is required to save lives, the Joint Committee on Human Rights warned. It described the proposed Nationality and Borders Bill as littered with measures which are simply incompatible with the UKaposs international obligations. Committee chairman Harriet Harman said: The Government is determined to prevent these crossings, but pushbacks are not the solution.They will not deter crossings, the seas will become even more dangerous and the people smugglers will continue to evade punishment.  Current failures in the immigration and asylum system cannot be remedied by harsher penalties and more dangerous enforcement action. The Bill is littered with measures that are simply incompatible with human rights law and the UKaposs obligations under international treaties. That is why we have called on the Government to amend the Bill by clearly setting out how any new measures can be carried out with respect to human rights law. Any measures that cannot meet these standards should be removed from the Bill completely. The legality and effectiveness of the tactic has been repeatedly called into question ever since it was first proposed, with campaigners threatening legal action against the Home Secretary. But Priti Patel has insisted the plan has a legal basis, although the Home Officeaposs permanent secretary Matthew Rycroft previously conceded that only a small proportion of boats could be turned back. The committeeaposs report said: A policy of pushbacks would likely be incompatible with the UKaposs obligations under international human rights law and maritime law. It added: Pushbacks are known to endanger lives at sea. This is even more so when dealing with people on small, unseaworthy vessels, in a busy shipping lane, often with rough waters, without appropriate le-saving equipment, as is the case for migrants in small boats in the Channel.  A policy of pushbacks fails to comply with the obligations to save those in distress, contrary to the right to le and international maritime law. Moreover, pushbacks would do the opposite of what is required to save lives. Pushbacks would create a situation where state actors were actively placing iniduals in situations that would increase the risk to le. Under the current conditions, we cannot see how a policy of pushbacks can be implemented without risking lives, contrary to the UKaposs obligations under the right to le and international maritime law. Plans to criminalise those arrive in the UK without a visa or through other approved immigration routes are inconsistent with the United Nations Refugee Convention, which explicitly prohibits refugees being penalised for unauthorised entry, the committee said, adding: Given the limited options refugees have for entering the UK via legal routes the Government should reconsider these measures. The group of MPs and peers also called for reassurance that border officials will not be granted immunity from prosecution where criminal offences are committed leading to loss of le at sea. A Home Office spokesman said: As part of our ongoing operational response and to prevent further loss of le at sea, we continue to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options to find ways of stopping small boats making this dangerous and unnecessary journey. These all comply and are delivered in accordance with both domestic and international law.

Sajid Javid gave the less-than-certain advice to millions of Brits after fresh mixed messages from government. Yesterday a top advisor to the government, Dr Jenny Harries, was slapped down by Boris Johnson after suggesting Brits may want to cut down socialising at Christmas. She said “not socialising when we donapost particularly need to” would “help to keep the iant at bay”. But Boris Johnson rejected her advice and said events should go ahead. Today Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister, urging people to “follow the existing guidance and be sensible about that.”  But the existing advice says people “may wish to take a rapid lateral flow testit is expected that there will be a period of high risk that day. “This includes spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illnessthey get COVID-.” The government also “continues to expect and strongly recommend that you wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.” Mr Javid said he would personally take a lateral flow test before a big party, despite not saying Brits should definitely do so.  He told Sky News: “It’s not a formal recommendation in the guidance, butI was going to a party with lots of people and things, I would. “But I would have done that even before we knew about this iant.” He later told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: If you are invited to a Christmas party, thereaposs quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFTbefore you go. Go to the party, but just be cautious. Askedhe’d wear a mask at the party he replied: “Maybe. “It dependsI’m walking around or sitting down - it depends. If I’m eating. People just need to make a decision based on the guidance.” He added: “I think people should continue in the way they were planning to behave over Christmas. I don’t think there’s any need to change those plans.” It comes after face masks were made mandatory in shops and public transport in England to fight the spread of the Omicron iant. Face mask laws and mandatory -day isolation for close contacts of suspected Omicron cases have been introduced for three weeks - and could be extended beyond December  - while scientists work out the risk.  Mr Javid claimed the restrictions “might” be reviewed earlier than the planned three-week review date on December . We are confident that actually maybe within two weeks we will know a lot more about this. We may not even need to wait three weeks, he said. SAGE member Prof Andrew Hayward told Times Radio people should take precautions before Christmas parties to avoid a lockdown. He said: “ One of my concerns is that there is an intensication of social mixing just in the run up to Christmas and the timing of that is a bit unfortunate given these circumstances. “I’m not saying those events should be stopped or banned. “But people might think of spending more time outside at them, trying to keep more of a distance, wearing masks, potentially taking tests before they go and potentially taking tests after theyaposve been to one and before they visit their relatives at Christmas.” Labour has called for more face mask mandates including in pubs, and for theof pre-departure tests for people coming to the UK. Leaked SAGE minutes warn the Covid Omicron iant could need “very stringent response measures”it threatens the NHS. Notes from a meeting on Monday, obtained by the BBC, say it is “highly likely” that the multiple-mutated strain can resist vaccine immunity “to some extent”, like the Delta iant does.The notes add: Any signicant reduction in protection against infection could still result in a very large wave of infections.” A government spokesman did not deny the minutes were genuine and warned: “We continue to monitor the situation closely and will not hesitate to take further actionnecessary.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A SAGE subgroup said it “can’t rule out” the drastic scenariothe B... strain has a major resistance to the vaccine. The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupsaid Omicron’s multiple mutations “are highly likely” to make antibodies from vaccination or previous infection less effective. The experts said there was not yet direct experimental evidence of “immune escape”, but evidence so far was “highly suggestive” that it can infect previously infected or vaccinated people. They added: “If introduced into the UK, B... would likely be capable of initiating a new wave of infections. “We cannot exclude that this wave would be of a magnitude similar, or even larger, than previous waves.”  They went on: “Although data on disease severity associated with B... are not yet available, a large wave of infections will be accompanied by a wave of severe cases. “The subgroup cannot rule out that this may be sufficient to overwhelm NHS capacity.” The NERVTAG meeting was held on November , a day before Omicron was designated a iant of concern by the World Health Organisation. Since then the government has extended boosters to all adults just three months after their second dose, and introduced mandatory mask-wearing and travel testing rules.But leaked minutes of a main SAGE meeting - held on Monday - say it would be “valuable” to go further, forcing travellers to the UK to take a Covid test before they take their flight.Currently travellers from non-red-list countries will only need to take a Day  test after arrival and isolate until it comes back negative. The leaked SAGE minutes said this approach will “identy signicantly fewer cases than an additional test on either day five or day eight.  Labour have demanded theof pre-departure tests while the Welsh and Scottish governments have called for tests on Day , and for travellers to isolate until then.New Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: “It is totally unacceptable that Ministers are failing to take action at the border when even their own advisors are telling them to introduce pre-departure tests. “It cannot be right that people can travel to an airport, board a busy flight, queue at busy departure gates, and travel on trains and buses in the UK, all without having taken a test. “The government must not repeat the mistakes it made earlier in the pandemic by being too slow to take action to prevent further cases of the Omicron iant entering the UK.”It came as the leaked minutes of a main SAGE meeting said the Omicron iant could need “very stringent response measures”it threatens the NHS. Notes from a meeting on Monday, obtained by the BBC, say it is “highly likely” that the multiple-mutated strain can resist vaccine immunity “to some extent”, like the Delta iant already does.The notes add: Any signicant reduction in protection against infection could still result in a very large wave of infections. “This would in turn lead to a potentially high number of hospitalisations even with protection against severe disease being less affected. It comes after Boris Johnson last night insisted a Christmas lockdown was extremely unlikely. A government spokesman did not deny the minutes were genuine and warned: “We continue to monitor the situation closely and will not hesitate to take further actionnecessary.” Face mask laws and mandatory -day isolation for close contacts of suspected Omicron cases have been introduced for three weeks - and could be extended beyond December  - while scientists work out the risk.Health Secretary Sajid Javid today said people “maybe” want to take a lateral flow test before going to Christmas parties. But he rejected comments of government advisor Dr Jenny Harries who suggested people may want to cut down on socialising.

We are confident that actually maybe within two weeks we will know a lot more about this. We may not even need to wait three weeks, he said. A government spokesperson said: “As soon as we became aware of the Omicron iant we took rapid action to protect public health - including expanding the red list, introducing PCR testing for travellers, changing the rules on self-isolation for close contacts and mandating face coverings in shops and on public transport. “On top of this we are speeding up our vaccination programme by offering all adults in England a booster jab by the end of January, halving the gap between second doses and boosters, and offering second jabs to - year olds, following advice from the JCVI.

Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson have been given big departments to look after as the leader moves his team further away from the Corbyn-era left.And heavyweights Yvette Cooper and David Lammywon two of the biggest roles in the shadow cabinet.Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided when news of the reshuffle broke, as she was delivering a keynote speech on Labour ’s plans to tackle sleaze.She said: I don’t know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it.  You may have been blindsided too - since it all happened on a major day of Covid news. So who’s rising up the ranks and who was demoted from a top job  Here’s everything you need to know.PROMOTED Yvette Cooper - Shadow Home SecretaryA starto Labour’s top team, the MP since  served under Blair, Brown and Miliband and came third in the  leadership race.Her job as Shadow Home Secretary - where she took on Theresa May - ended when she said she could not serve under Jeremy Corbyn.As DWP Secretary in  she faced controversy over benefit sanctions in the Welfare Reform Bill, and her views on Corbyn cast a shadow for the left. But away from the front bench, she carved out a fearsome reputation as chair of the Home Affairs Committee, sharply interrogating Priti Patel. Born to a union chief and maths teacher, the -year-old went from a state comprehensive to a first-class Oxford degree. After a year off with ME aged  - “I hated every minute of it” - she worked on Bill Clinton’s  presidential bid. Following her ascent in Westminster, she and husband Ed Balls made history as the first married couple to serve in Cabinet together. David Lammy - Shadow Foreign SecretaryThe outspoken -year-old from Tottenham enjoys a promotion from Justice to one of the traditional great offices of state. As a friend of Barack Obama with contacts in the US Senate, he may take more naturally to the role than ‘Red Wall’-focused Lisa Nandy. Elected in , he rose through the ranks under Blair and Brown before a -year backbench spell under Miliband and Corbyn. On the back benches he campaigned powerfully for the Windrush generation and Grenfell victims, which included a friend of his, with viral speeches. He was an outspoken anti-Brexit MP during years of rows and stirred debate in  when he argued Comic Relief ‘perpetuates Band Aid stereotypes’. But he is not easily pigeon-holed, chairing a review of racism in the justice system for the Tory government, and nominating Corbyn for leadership. Wes Streeting - Shadow Health SecretaryAged , the former National Union of Students President and MP since  will be seen as a moderniser in the top team.He worked for the Blairite group Progress for a year after graduating and was a staunch critic of Jeremy Corbyn, joining Keir Starmer ’s front bench in May this year.Born to teenage parents, he grew up on an east London council estate, had free school meals and was the first in his family to go to university.He has personal experience of the NHS, having a kidney removed earlier this year due to cancer.Bridget Phillipson - Shadow Education SecretaryThe -year-old enjoys a promotion from Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury to holding the Tories to account over schools. Elected in , this is the biggest role yet for the Houghton and Sunderland South MP. She joined Labour aged , attended a Catholic school and co-chaired the Oxford University Labour club.A backer of David Miliband, Yvette Cooper, Owen Smith and Keir Starmer, she supported remain and a People’s Voteon Brexit.Peter Kyle - Shadow Northern Ireland SecretaryIt is the first Shadow Cabinet job for the -year-old frontbencher, who was elected to Hove in . He was a vocal opponent of Brexit and led a bid, blocked by Tories, to lower the voting age to . A former special advisor and charity chief, he backed Liz Kendall and Jess Phillips in the  and  leadership elections. Pat McFadden - Shadow Chief Secretary to the TreasuryThis is the first shadow cabinet job for more than a decade for the ex-Blair and Brown minister.From a family of seven children to a labourer and children’s home worker who grew up in Glasgow, -year-old was an advisor to Tony Blair before and after the  election.Shadow Europe Minister under Jeremy Corbyn, he was was sacked by the left-wing leader in . Mr McFadden lost his job for asking the Prime Minister to reject the view that sees terrorist acts as always being a response or a reaction to what we in the west do.MOVED Lisa Nandy - Shadow Levelling Up SecretarySome would see a move from Shadow Foreign Secretary as a demotion, but not the Wigan MP. When the -year-old won her last job a colleague was said to remark: “That’s a lot of towns, Nandy”.And askedshadowing Michael Gove and the government’s key policy area felt like a demotion, Ms Nandy told BBC Breakfast: It felt a little like coming home, to be honest.”She has for years beat the drum about left-behind northern areas, co-founding the Centre For Towns think tank. She co-chaired Owen Smith’s  challenge to Corbyn and ran herself for the top job in , coming third. Steve Reed - Shadow Justice SecretaryThe -year-old is moving from the Shadow Communities Secretary job to his second shadow cabinet post. Unlike many others who’ve been promoted he was consistently a minister under Jeremy Corbyn. Born in Hertfordshire, he worked in publishing for almost two decades before becoming an MP. His dad played for Charlton Athletic and he knew Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker when he went to university in Sheffield. Mr Reed founded the Labour Together group and helped run Keir Starmer’s  leadership campaign. Jo Stevens - Shadow Wales SecretaryFormer Shadow Culture secretary Jo Stevens was demoted to Shadow Welsh Secretary, replacing Nia Grfith. Since September this year she had been up against Nadine Dorries, the controversial Tory minister. Born in Swansea, she worked for a solicitors’ firm before winning Cardf Central in , ousting the Lib Dems.She had this job before under Corbyn, but resigned from it in  to vote against triggering Article  and Brexit. Lucy Powell - Shadow Culture SecretaryAnother sideways move, Lucy Powell shts from the ministry of housing to the ‘ministry of fun’. The Manchester Central MP worked at Labour HQ during the  election and later helped lead an inquest into the party’s  defeat.Jonathan Reynolds - Shadow Business SecretaryThe long-time political aide and MP since  is another survivor through both the Miliband and Corbyn eras.As shadow DWP chief he announced Labour would cut the ‘taper’ in Universal Credit - which the Tories later did.He had suggested he was open to the idea of a Universal Basic Income but later cooled on the costly plan.Louise Haigh - Shadow Transport SecretaryThe -year-old was for a time Parliament’s youngest Labour MP and has enjoyed a steady rise. The former Unite shop steward and Special Constable supported Owen Smith’s  leadership challenge but also served as Policing Minister under Corbyn. More recently she has landed attacks on Tory ministers over Northern Ireland amid chaos over Brexit. After being Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, the Transport brief is her second job. Nick Thomas-Symonds - Shadow Trade SecretaryFew would argue the reshuffle was a demotion for the historian, who has written biographies of Attlee and Bevan. He took a finely-judged approach to the thorny issue of migration in the face of hardline statements by Priti Patel. Elected an MP in , the -year-old is another of those who served in junior ranks throughout Corbyn’s time.Ed Miliband - Shadow Climate Change and Net Zero SecretaryThe former Labour leader had enjoyed ato the shadow cabinet under Keir Starmer. However, his job has now been split into two - one covering business and the other climate change. This will give him more time to focus on climate change, on which he has campaigned relentlessly in recent years. But it could prove dficult for him to land a blow on the government, given the role he’s shadowing doesn’t technically exist.Jon Ashworth - Shadow Work and Pensions SecretaryNicknamed ‘Sparkle’, the No advisor in the Blair Brown years proved a survivor even through the Corbyn era. An MP since a  by-election has had  years of unbroken service on the front bench including as the longest-serving Labour shadow health secretary in history. He was moved while off sick with Covid, but insisted it was good news, telling friends he needed a new challenge.Emily Thornberry - Shadow Attorney GeneralThe MP equivalent of a Duracell bunny, the lawyer was another survivor through the era of Corbyn, who was her Islington constituency neighbour. But she’s slipped from the top of the pack since doing the Shadow Foreign Secretary job under the former leader. She was notorious in  for tweeting a photo of a house in Kent with a white van and England flags. The lawyer was accused of snobbery and was later “squeezed out” of the  Labour leadership race, not winning enough nominations to go to the members’ vote. But her story is not what you might think - she told the Mirror in  how she remembered bailfs coming to her home, where her mum’s cats were put down because she was too poor to care for them. Jim McMahon - Shadow Environment SecretaryThe -year-old - moved from Transport - is another junior member of the top team and like Lisa Nandy, another voice for towns in the north. He was a council leader in Oldham and represented councillors on Labour’s ruling NEC before winning the  Oldham West and Royton by-election. His victory defied fears Corbyn’s Labour would tank at the ballot box - at least then - and he’s been on the front bench almost ever since.OUT Kate Green - Shadow Education Secretary Luke Pollard - Shadow Environment Secretary Nia Grfith - Shadow Welsh Secretary Cat Smith - Shadow Voter Engagement MinisterCharlie Falconer - Shadow Attorney General,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Cllr Nick Kelly initially refused to apologise for saying everyone had a responsibility not to put themselves in a compromising position after she vanished earlier this month. A body found on a beach has been now been confirmed to be missing -year-old. A large search was launched after she disappeared in Plymouth, Devon, on Saturday November , after failing to meet her boyfriend. Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Conservative Association confirmed in a statement that Kelly had been temporarily suspended, pending an investigation. He made the comments during an ITV interview on November .PlymouthLive reports that there was an outcry on social media and from a number of local politicians.Cllr Tudor Evans, leader of the opposition on Plymouth City Council, said: It’s dficult to conceive of a more insensitive and arrogant thing to say at this time, or, in fact, at any time. He was also slammed for his victim-blaming rhetoric. Cllr Kelly initially told PlymouthLive : “In no way was I implying Bobbi-Anne did anything wrong in any way.He then said: “I again apologise unreservedly that my words have taken away this focus, at a time when we should all be working together to grieve for Bobbi-Anne.” He added: “This tragedy is in no way her fault. What has happened to her is solely at the hands of the person who took her le.  “I am aware that a snippet from one interview I carried out, relating to general community safety issues in the city, and comments made in an informal conversation, have been used to imply the opposite. It could not be further from the truth.”In a heartbreaking update on Tuesday, Devon and Cornwall Police wrote: Formal identication has now been completed and it has been confirmed that the body located in Bovisand on  November is that of -year-old Bobbi-Anne McLeod.Her family have been informed of this update and have asked for their privacy to be respected at this time.

A price comparison of eight leading supermarkets put Asda in second place and Tesco third. Surprisingly, Lidl was fourth with £., behind Tesco’s £. basket and £. at Asda. Waitrose was the most expensive at £. - more than £ dearer than Aldi - for staples from the turkey and stuffing to veg, mince pies and Christmas pud.  According to the study, Tesco and Asda have closed the gap on the budget chains with pennies separating their bills from Aldi’s and both cheaper than Lidl. Tesco and Asda were cheaper than the discounters for Christmas puds, matched them on the cost of kg of potatoes and their own label mince pies cost under £ - more than % less than Lidl’s at £.. And Tesco also matched the Aldi and Lidl price for kg of parsnips and carrots. But when it came to the centrepiece, the discounters had the best value turkey crown at £. compared £. at Asda and £ at Tesco. Waitrose had the most expensive bird costing £ with Morrisons and Sainsbury’s the second most expensive at £..

Ms Redfern refused to comply with the order and defiantly re-opened the next day. She argued the action against her was unlawful and she needed to provide for her family. The council then took the case to Swansea Magistratesapos Court, in a bid to force the cinema to shut for a specied period. At a hearing on Tuesday, solicitor Lee Reynolds argued that Cinema  Co had clearly ignored the rules. He said: The reality is we say, the way these premises are being run, is asCovid simply does not exist.  The important point we rely upon, whilst it is accepted we will never be able to prove that the premises are infected, they may be infected. Businesses are given directions to minimise the risk of infection and contamination, and the way these premises are being run means they may be contaminated. This is not a theoretical risk, the officers have attended, seen the lack of signage, lack of anti-bacterial hand wash. It is a real risk instead of a theoretical one. It is based on the eye witness account of officers who have attended and can, on oath, put forward a position why these premises could be infected or contaminated due to the way they are run.  However, Ms Redfern hit back - insisting her business was safe and claimed that the action against her had been unlawful. She said: They are trying to close me down unlawfully and each time they have turned up I havenapost been there and itaposs just incorrect. I donapost believe the allegations are correct at all. Public Health Act - I have a right to run my business. All I have done is give my customers the freedom of choice whether they want to come to my business or not. The councilaposs unlawful closure is having a ripple effect on the local community. However, Ms Redfernaposs appeal for District Judge Neal Thomas to dismiss the case was rejected. He said: Iaposm satisfied the local authorityaposs application has been properly brought under the Public Health Act and I grant the application as requested. Itaposs clear from the evidence the local authority is trying to do no more than their job. To try and reduce the risk of transmission of a disease. The outcome of his ruling does not mean Ms Redfern has a criminal conviction against her name, but it does mean that the councilaposs enforcement action against her was legally correct. And as a result, it means that Cinema  Co must comply with Covid regulations - effectively meaning it will have to shut its doors, as per the councilaposs original order. Solicitor Mr Reynolds said thatCinema  Co remained open then an application for contempt of court would be made. He said those who were found to be in contempt of court can face a jail sentence. Ms Redfern was told to pay the councilaposs legal costs of £,. She declined to comment as she left court. A council spokesman said: We welcome the decision today by the district judge, which we hope will encourage the owner of Cinema  Co to carry out the necessary work to protect staff and customers. During this entire process, the Council did not want to close down this business - indeed we have provided millions of pounds of funding, help and support so businesses can operate safely during the pandemic. We want Cinema  Co open and trading, the same as the majority of businesses in Swansea and Wales, who are following the rules and are doing all they can to keep people safe. We will continue to offer support and advice to Cinema  Co to ensure those measures are in place and that they can operate safely. The coronavirus virus is still with us and signicant concerns remain about the potential impact of the new Omicron iant.The measures and regulations currently in place are vital to help slow the spread of the virus and to protect the NHS and social care.We hope Cinema  Co will comply with the court order and follow all of the Covid safety measures.

Health officials in the area, said it was highly probable that the Covid iant had been discovered there, and said it is taking precautionary action against its spread. The B. . . iant, known as Omicron, was first identied in southern Africa, but has since been reported in at least  other countries but is expected to be far more widespread. Cases in the UK have been found from Glasgow, to Liverpool, Norfolk and London as the government works to try and keep the new iant from spilling out of control. See the full list of where it is in the UK below. Since its discovery the government has announced tighter restrictions, including requiring mask wearing on public transport. So far, every confirmed case in the UK has been tested and along with their contacts are isolating.  The full list of cases where the Omicron iant is across the UK: Barnet –  Bolton -  Brentwood –  Camden –  Glasgow -  Haringey –  Lanarkshire -  Liverpool –  North Norfolk –  Nottingham –  Sutton –  Wandsworth –  Westminster –  Health officials have said that it is “highly probable” that there are two more cases of the Omicron iant in Bolton. The iniduals that tested positive are said to be linked, and members of their households are being re-tested and are self-isolating. Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: “We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this iant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy. “Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new iant – please get your first, second, third or booster jab without delay. Following the change in JCVI advice yesterday, a booster dose for everyone over  years is now recommended at a minimum of  months from your last primary course jab. Please take up this offer as soon as you are invited to protect yourself, your families and your communities.  “Please make sure to wear a mask in line with government guidance, including on public transport and in shops, to help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new iant. “It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing. That’s why it’s critical that anyone with Covid- symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately.”  All nine of Scotland’s Omicron cases can be traced back to a single event, which took place on November . First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that this suggested that there was community transmission already happening within the UK. She added that more cases were likely over the coming days, which could also be linked to this super-spreader event. Most of England’s cases focus in and around London.  The case in Brentwood, Essex, was linked to a local KFC branch but all staff tested negative and the fast food chain has reopened since. One of the cases in Westminster involved an inidual who left the country shortly after. Wales and Northern Ireland are yet to report a confirmed case of the new iant.

Police said the opening of The Ripped Gym in Harlow in Essex in November last year was a blatant breach of legislation and put peopleaposs lives at risk.In police bodycam footage, -year-old owner Michelle Meade-Wyatt told officers who attended the gym that she did not consent to any fines. She refused to provide her details and added: Iaposm a living woman and weaposre under common law. An officer warned her she would be arrested and that the matter would be dealt with under Covid- legislation. Essex Police said that after around  minutes of trying to engage with her, officers felt they had no choice but to arrest her for breaching the regulations. The force said that Meade-Wyatt, of Liverpool, admitted at Colchester Magistratesapos Court to breaching Covid- restrictions.She pleaded guilty to failing to cease carrying on a business that was restricted under the Health Protection CoronavirusRegulations , police said.She was ordered to pay fines and costs totalling £, at the hearing on November .  Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Nolan said: This case is a very clear example of a blatant breach of the legislation, which not only put peopleaposs health at risk, but at a time when infection rates were rising. She said that officers and council staff had made extensive attempts to engage with the gym owner to resolve this situation. Meade-Wyatt told the PA news agency: I stayed open because the members were committing suicide. She said she only admitted the charge after there was a slight changing of wording. Meade-Wyatt claimed that after her arrest she was held for just under  hours, and she plans to take civil action against the force.

The sheep can be seen laying in the long grass as the violent stallion jumps around and picks up the defenceless animal and aggressively slings its body in every which way.The sheep already looks leless as it is dropped to the floor before the horse picks it up again to throw it around once more.  A couple of startled onlookers can be seen tentatively approaching the horse in a bid to help the sheep, but decide to hang back as the furious horse is filmed bucking and throwing its head around in a display of sheer rage. As the sheep is picked up a second time its face is red with blood from its injuries. Viewers of the shocking footage remarked about the power and potential threat horses can pose when distressed. One user commented: Everyone knows to stay clear of the back end, but the front is really the most dangerous. Iaposve seen my horse lt a  lb bale of hay and causally toss it when trying to pull some lose bits of forage out.  Another added: Easy to forget how powerful horses are. Lted that sheep and threw it around like it was nothing. Others took pity on the sheep making reference to their gentle nature, used to soothe children to sleep. One comment read: I bet that sheep wishes it was jumping over a sleeping childaposs mind, being counted so that they could fall asleep.

The government is keen for anyone who shows any covid symptom to take a free PCR, which can be booked here. But many Brits have been coughing and sneezing more than usual – and there have even been reports of it being the worst cold ever so itaposs important to be able to tell the dference between the two coronavirus iants, a cold and the flu. What are the symptoms of a cold  According to the NHS, the symptoms of a cold can come on gradually, and include:A blocked or runny noseA sore throat HeadachesMuscle aches Coughs A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smell  What are the symptoms of the flu  The NHS says flu symptoms can include:a sudden fever – a temperature of C or above an aching body feeling tired or exhausted a dry cough a sore throat a headache dficulty sleeping loss of appetite diarrhoea or tummy pain feeling sick and being sickWhat are the main Covid symptoms According to the NHS, the main coronavirus symptoms are: A high temperature A new, continuous cough A loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteMost of the above symptoms are the first that were officially recognised by the government and are still the accepted ones linked to the Delta iant.Statistics from South Africa, where the Omicron iant was first detected and sequenced, has shown that there have been no hospital admissions and no deaths from people with Omicron.Doctors also say people recover from it in just a few days after symptoms, including tiredness, headache and muscle aches, pass.  Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, who was one of the first people to suspect the Omicron Covid strain, has said she noticed patients at her private clinic showing symptoms that are dferent from the Delta iant.Dr Coetzee told the AFP that she alerted health officials of a clinical picture that doesnapost fit Delta on  November when seven patients showed dferent symptoms that seemed very much related to normal viral infection. She said her patients presented with extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, scratchy throat and dry cough. Unlike the previous iants, this one doesnapost cause loss of taste or smell, she added.

There are some however, who decide to take it on the chin and see it as an inevitable factor of le.Take Ricky Gervais for example, in an interview with journalist Charles Wooley he insisted that ‘parties don’t last forever’ and saw the funny side to death. Another celebrity with a fearless opinion on death is Sir David Attenborough, who was asked in an interview with Anderson Cooper, CBS News, for his thoughts on the subject.During the chat, Attenborough discusses optimism and the idea of death and what he fears the most. Cooper asks Attenborough: “What are you most fearful of at this moment ” To which Attenborough responds: “Becoming helpless and gaga.” When asked whether he fears death or not, Attenborough responds bluntly: “No. Not for the process, I’d just like it to be a quick process, thanks very much.” Attenborough is then asked by Anderson what moment in his le would he want to relive, Attenborough says: First time seeing the coral reef. Watching a hummingbird. Sitting alongside a gorilla. Holding my first born baby.”  To conclude the interview, he shared a poignant message when asked what he thinks more people should know.

In the months before her diagnosis in , the -year-old had lost three stone and was so ill that she collapsed in the hospital where she was sent for clinical assessment.It followed years of unexplained symptoms, during which time her blood was taken numerous times - but she was never tested for HIV. Ahead of World AIDS Day on December , Sandra is sharing her story in the hope it can raise awareness around testing and ensure people get the vital treatment they need sooner. Despite experiencing a number of chest infections and symptoms linked with HIV - such as unexplained night sweats, weight loss, coldsores and thrush for  years - she said medics never even considered the virus. She believes that because of her age, location and not falling into a group with a high prevalence of HIV, medics overlooked the possibility that she could have the illness.  It wasnapost until July , after being sent to hospital in Harrogate that Sandra, from North Yorkshire, was finally given the answer she needed. The doctor told me that I was HIV positive, she recalled. I thought he was going to say stage four cancer. It was a relief to know what it was. By that stage her condition was so advanced that medics said she needed immediate urgent treatment at St Jamesapos University in Leeds to save her le. I was pretty far gone, I was at the stage where it was goodbye, Sandra said. They said that within  hours it would be critical. I was in hospital for the whole of August , they saved my le.  Sandra said: I donapost know whether they discarded the idea that I had it, or just didnapost think of it at all. I just hope one or two of them went home and had a couple of nightmares. If anyone had said to letaposs do an HIV test Iaposd have said yes, by all means. An earlier diagnosis would have made a huge dference. If I had stayed at home, I live on my own, trying to live with this illness I could have died. I just donapost know why I wasnapost tested. Because of the weight loss I wonderedit was cancer that was being missed. She said she hopes her experience encourages medics to ensure patients are checked for HIV. Sandra said: Iaposve lived in fear that I was going to slip through the net. Iaposm an example of what can happen, but I donapost want this to be a sob story about me. I want to show that GPs should test for everything, itaposs only a simple blood test.  Sandra, who believes she had been HIV positive for  years before it was diagnosed, is now able to manage her condition through medication - although she said the amount of tablets she takes is higher than it would beshe had been diagnosed early. I donapost feel like Iaposm fading away, which is how I felt before, she said. Recent highly acclaimed TV drama Itaposs A Sin, which tackled the emergence of the AIDS epidemic in the s, was a hard watch, Sandra said. It shows people dying from AIDS, it was like a blow to the head because to me thataposs how I was when I went into St Jamesapos. It was only then that I realised Iaposd been living with it all through  and years and years prior to it.Sandra now volunteers with HiVitality, a charity which provides retreats for people with the condition to spent time with others in the same position.There are people out there that need reaching and need help, this is something that they need, she said. Charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, which provides support for people with HIV, said that the delay in identying Sandraaposs condition shouldnapost have happened, and said she was not tested until it was nearly too late. It is campaigning for opt-out testing at AE departments - meaning blood taken from patients is tested for HIV unless they say no - a move Sandra said she agrees with. Liz Porter, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: Sandra’s story is such a sad one and it absolutely shouldn’t have happened. Sandra was presenting with a lot of the indicators of undiagnosed HIV, including unexplained weight loss, coldsores and thrush, and yet no one thought to test her until it was almost too late. Sandra’s is an extreme and rare example of incredibly late diagnosis, but the latest data shows that % of people diagnosed with HIV are still being diagnosed late. Which means the diagnosis comes after damage to the immune system has already begun. This is worst in those aged  and over where a shocking % of people are diagnosed late. Too often both iniduals and health professionals don’t think of HIV affecting certain groups, for example a white woman in her s like Sandra. Ms Porter said that routine testing in Sandraaposs area could have made. a big dference and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing. She stated: Routine testing across healthcare is a clear way to avoid this happening to others, alongside educating professionals about HIV and what indicator conditions to look out for. If routine testing had been in place where Sandra lives, she would have been diagnosed years earlier with a simple test at her GP and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing. It would also have saved the NHS money and avoided Sandra’s weeks in hospital. You can live a long, healthy le with HIV thanks to treatment – but the earlier you’re diagnosed, the better.

The evidence was heard during the trial of the Duke of Yorkaposs pal in New York where she stands accused of grooming and abusing four minors. Epsteinaposs long time airman Lawrence Visoski said he was familiar with Prince Andrew when quizzed about flying the royal by defence lawyers for the British socialite. When asked by Maxwellaposs legal team: Are you familiar with Prince Andrew  Visoski replied Yes. Lawyer Christian Everdell then said: And he flew on Mr Epsteinaposs plane, right  Visoski responded, He did.  The airman became the second pilot to admit flying the Duke, , on Epsteinaposs jets. Captain Dave Rodgers has previously provided his flight logs in a civil case involving a victim of the late Wall Street financier that showed Andrew had taken several flights with the convicted sex offender. The evidence pours more pressure on the Duke to tell all he knows about Epstein as prosecutors and the FBI continue to probe the paedophileaposs sexual offending. As well as Andrew, Visoski recalled Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Chris Tucker, astronaut John Glenn and actor Kevin Spacey all as passengers. While giving evidence yesterday the pilot testied Maxwell was “number two in Epstein’s world. Visoski, who is was called by prosecutors as their first witness, recalled how the British socialite would often contact him to schedule flights for the Wall Street financier.  Maxwell, who was once Epstein’s girlfriend, has been charged with recruiting and grooming four underage girls to give him erotic massages, describing them as a ruse for sex abuse. Ms Maxwell was number two. Mr Epstein was a big number one, Visoski told jurors. She was the one that pretty much handled most of the finance, my expenses, spending in the office.” When cross-examined by Mr Everdell, Visoski said that during his near -year employment he never witnessed any sex abuse or underage girls without their parents aboard. “I never saw any sexual activity, no,” the airmen, who was gted land by Epstein at his New Mexico Ranch, told Mr Everdell. Visoski said he did not notice any underage girls without their parents on the planes including Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre and a victim identied as “Jane” at the trial. At one point Mr Everdell asked: If Mr Epstein were engaging in sex acts with underage girls he probably would have told you not to leave the cockpit, correct   Prosecutors raised an objection which Judge Alison Nathan overruled. Visoski replied: Correct. The pilot said he flew Giuffre in the mid to late s, but believed her to be a “shorter woman with dirty blonde hair.” He added he believed a passenger named aposJaneapos - one of four women accusing Maxwell of sexual abuse - was a “mature woman with some piercing powder blue eyes.” Prosecutors entered a birth certicate for Jane, whose identity is protected, into evidence under seal. Maxwell, , has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes, including two perjury charges that will be tried at a later date. She faces up to  years in prisonconvicted on all counts. Lawyers for Maxwell have said the British socialite was being scapegoated for crimes Epstein committed. The financier died in jail in August  while awaiting trial on sex-abuse charges. Earlier yesterday, Judge Nathan said she had excused one juror from the case because his spouse had surprised him with a planned trip around the Christmas holiday.  As a result,  jurors and five alternates, instead of six, will continue hearing testimony in the expected six-week trial, which began on Monday. Visoskiaposs testimony provided jurors with a sense of the lestyle she lived between  and , the period in which prosecutors say the Brit - the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell - lured four underage girls for Epstein to abuse. The pilot said he frequently shuttled Epstein and guests between the billionaireaposs properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, Paris and Caribbean islands. In her opening statement on Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Pomerantz said prosecutors would present flight logs that included the names of Maxwell and some of the alleged victims. Maxwellaposs defence attorney, Bobbi Sternheim, responded saying there was nothing inherently wrong with having private jets. The jet-setting lestyle contrasts with Maxwell’s confinement since her July  arrest at the politan Detention Center in Brooklyn, including her complaints about raw sewage permeating her cell and being served mouldy food.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Donald TrumpPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkKevin SpaceyPrivate jetsBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dr Harries said there could be a further  “highly likely” cases.But how concerned should we be about the new coronavirus iant and could it really derail our festive plans Prof Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, has the answers…How worried should we be about the Omicron iant When any new iant of the virus that causes Covid- is identied, we don’t at first know how infectious it will be, whether it will cause a more serious illness than other iants and how well vaccines will work against it. We therefore need to be cautious and take measures to control the spread of Omicron until this information becomes available. We shouldn’t, however, become unduly anxious. I’ve heard that the iant causes more mild symptoms. Is that true andso why are we worried Some early reports from South Africa suggest that Omicron may cause a milder illness than other iants. However, we will need data from many more people infected with the Omicron iant – particularly older and clinically vulnerable people – before we can reach reliable conclusions about the severity of the illness it causes.Why are they giving more booster jabsthe new iant can evade existing vaccines Two doses of current vaccines provide good protection – and three doses provides even better protection – against the other strains of coronavirus. At present, we have no evidence the Omicron iant can evade existing vaccines. We need to continue with the booster programme as this has been very effective in keeping down the number of infections that can result in hospital admission or death. Does the new iant transmit any dferently We don’t yet have good data on whether Omicron can infect people more easily than other iants. It will gradually emerge in the coming weeks.Does it mean existing Covid treatments like the new antiviral treatments won’t work either  It is possible that some of the newer antiviral treatments won’t work aswell against Omicron as against other iants. However, this will need to be confirmed in research studies.It’s very likely, however, that antiviral treatments will still reduce the severity of illness caused by Omicron.What don’t we know about Omicron and when will we know We currently lack important information about Omicron – such as how infectious it is, whether it causes a more severe illness than other iants, how well vaccines protect against it and whether antiviral drugs will be helpful in reducing the severity of illness it causes. Research is already underway to answer all of these questions. How likely is it to affect Christmas and how We currently have a high Covid- infection rate in the UK. Fortunately, vaccines are keeping down the number of people with a more severe illness, which in turn is keeping the number of hospital admissions and deaths low. If we can get a high uptake of boosters, we should be able to have a more normal Christmas. But everyone should continue with infection control measures and not rely just on vaccination. People who are not vaccinated at allshould also come forward.Will mask wearing really stop it Masks can reduce the spread of infection – particularlya higher specication FFP mask is worn. But they work best when combined with other infection control measures such as vaccination and home-working.Will bringing forward boosters mean they’re not as efficient Bringing forward the booster to three months instead of six after people’s second vaccination won’t reduce its effectiveness in preventing serious illness. The booster dose substantially increases people’s immunity and this can help stop the Omicron iant evading our current vaccines. If the time between jabs is now three months, does that mean I’ll soon need a fourthI had my booster weeks ago The three month gap is for people who have not yet had a booster. If you have already had your booster, you won’t get a fourth dose . Those who have not yet had a booster no longer have to wait six months from their second dose and can have this earlier.What will happen in schools Many schools in England have had large Covid- outbreaks since the new school year started. It’s important that - year old children are vaccinated and also get a second vaccination once the Government has approved this. People working in schools also need to be fully vaccinated with three doses . Any child who is unwell with possible Covid- symptoms should get a PCR test and isolate until the result is back. Improving ventilation and air quality in schools is also essential to reduce the risk of infection. Could there be more travel bans If the Omicron iant spreads further, then more countries may be placed on the Red List. This can happen at very short notice, leaving travellers with the option of either cutting short their trip or facing an expensive stay in a quarantine hotel. Everyone should consider thisthey are planning an overseas trip.Where will I need to wear a face mask Face coverings will be mandatory by law in England’s shops, public transport, hairdressers, banks and post offices from am on Tuesday. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce rules.The Government has not published a full list but masks will not be mandatory in pubs and restaurants or cinemasand theatres like they were before. What are the new foreign travel rules From am on Tuesday, all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world must take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival and isolate until the result comes back negative. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Arrival from Red List countries must go into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. Those who breach isolation can be fined up to £,. When will I have to self-isolate All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their jab status. People who test positive for Covid must still self-isolate for  days and unvaccinated or partially vaccinated close contacts of a Covid case must do the same, regardless of which iant they have.What are the rules in schools The Government is “strongly advising” school pupils above Year , staff and visitors to wear masks in communal areas. Local public health teams can send groups of pupils home as a last-ditch measure to stop the spread.Can Christmas parties and gatherings go ahead Yes, there is no legal restriction on Christmas parties. People do not need to wear masks or show a vaccine passport in hospitality venues.Health Minister Edward Argar said people in England can “use their judgment” about whetherto attend festive bashes this year.Will the rules be tightened further  It is possible. Boris Johnson has not yet enacted all of England’s Plan B measures, leaving vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums in reserve.And people have not been advised to work from home where possible, despite advice of that kind in Scotland. The PM is not planning to adopt Scotland and Wales’ plea for eight days’ isolation for travellers who enter the country, but has not ruled it out.When will they expire They will expire on December  with a review ahead of that meaning they could be strengthened for Christmas.

Others at risk of developing severe Covid symptoms should also shelve trips, WHO stated. New advice was issued to people worldwide in the wake of the new iant, described as the most concerning yet discovered by worried experts.The organisation also urged countries to remain calm and take rational measures against the fast-spreading mutation. They also warned that blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of the iant despite some calls to totally close borders.  Persons who are unwell or at risk of developing severe Covid- disease and dying, including people  years of age or older or those with co-morbidities , should be advised to postpone travel, the WHO said in a travel advice statement. The UK has joined other countries in imposing a travel ban on South Africa. However, a complete travel ban will not prevent the global spread the iant, they added. The statement went on: “Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread, and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods.  In addition, they can adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivizing countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data.Countries should apply an evidence-informed and risk-based approach with any travel measures related to the Omicron iant of the coronavirus, they state,That including possible screening or quarantine of international passengers.It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Brits not to cancel Christmas plans - and stressed there is no immediate lockdown threat.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

The picture was uploaded to facebook after a resident in Cardf, Wales, spotted the electric BMW while on a walk, reports WalesOnline.A cable can be seen stretching from the home over the front garden of the property, connecting to the charging point of the car. It has sparked a big debate online about the practicality of electric vehicles - and the loss of pedestrianised spaces. The dad who uploaded the photo said a big re-think is needed. He captioned the post: Genuinely staggered to come across this on a walk with the baby. Since the s we’ve given so much space over to petrol cars.  We can’t allow the small pockets left for people to be given over to electric cars. But things didnapost end there, with more people chipping in with their views on the subject. One responded: This just wonapost do. Itaposs obstructing the footway with a vehicle – its mode of propulsion does not change that. That was echoed by another user, who said: You donapost get to block the pavement with your private property, go and charge it somewhere . Other agreed saying the car owner was being selfish. If you want to connect to the house give up your garden donapost ask me to give up the footpath, said a third before adding: I would be tempted to walk over that.  But not everyone saw eye-to-eye on the debate. One person posted: How about you finding an issue where there isn’t one  Plenty of room to get past, they’re just trying to create the safest situation they can. Would you prefer a long cable draped across to the road  Because that’s their other choice here. Find something real to get annoyed about.

The Buckingham Palace workman was visiting to dismantle a desk when an unexpected person offered him a brew. Speaking on Channel  documentary Secrets of the Royal Palaces, Royal Upholsterer Kevin Andrews, who worked for the late Queen Mother, explained what happened. He said: “A builder was dismantling a desk so he could not see who was making the offer when the ladyaposs voice asked himhe would like a cup of tea.”  Without realising it was the Queen herself who answered, he is said to have replied: “Yeah. In a mug. Two sugars. Builderaposs tea. “I donapost want any of that nonsense I had the last time I was here, all that fine china and all that saucer stuff.” Without saying anything, the Queen dropped off his cup of tea on the table, and by the time he went to pick it up the builder could only look on as he saw her walking away. The Queen is likely to have found the encounter funny, as she is known for her humour and good nature when she meets oblivious people. Like the time a hapless group of tourists once bumped into the Queen walking around her Balmoral estate - but didnapost recognise her. The monarch was out for a low-key walk in tweeds and a headscarf, something she likes to do when she gets the chance.  One of her former protection officers has revealed the -year-old likes to slip under the radar when possible. Richard Grfin claims that once a group of American tourists failed to recognise her.Speaking to The Times, Richard said the Queen didnapost want to blow her cover at the time.She went along with the tourists as they questioned whether she lived in the area, replying that she had a house nearby. When they asked hersheaposd ever met the Queen, all she said was No, but this policeman has, gesturing towards Mr Grfin. Richard - who worked closely with the monarch for more than  years - said the group then moved on, having no idea who theyaposd just met.

The supermarketaposs CEO Jason Tarry sent an email to customers this afternoon with details of five changes across stores to prevent the spread of the virus.His announcement contradicts an earlier report from the BBC which said several UK supermarkets, including Tesco, would not enforce the Governmentaposs mask-wearing law.In the email, Mr Tarry said it will be a legal requirement for customers to wear a face covering in our stores . Tesco, the UKaposs largest supermarket chain, will also operate a traffic light system in most large stores and the busiest Express stores.  The system will help staff to monitor the flow of customers and prevent overcrowding. Hand sanitisers will be placed at store entrances for people to clean their hands and wipe down baskets and trolleys. Protective screens have been installed around each checkout - which are now all open to reduce queuing times. Staff have designated separate exits and entrances to make entering and leaving the store as easy as possible.  Mr Tarry also asked customers to remember drivers and in-store staff are still working very hard in dficult circumstances to feed the nation. So we’d just ask everyone to please be kind, patient and respectful as we try to keep everyone safe, he said. It comes after the BBC reported several stores would not enforce mask wearing. Iceland said customers would not be asked to don masks to stop them facing abuse. The earlier report suggested Tesco would only put signs up to advise customers to wear masks. Budget stores Aldi and Lidl will also avoid challenging customers, the BBC reports.News of the soft approach follows an announcement from industry body The British Retail Consortium, who said police should enforce the rule rather than retailers.  Greeters and security guards will remind people to cover up at Sainsburyaposs, according to the broadcaster. Morrisons will dish out masks to customers who have forgotten them and check people as they enter. Asda will also provide face coveringsneeded. And Iceland chief Richard Walker said it was unfair to put staff at risk of abuse from people who donapost want to put a mask on. He said: They are already working under signicant pressure, especially as we hit the busiest trading month of the year. I wonapost be putting my staff at any risk of confrontation or abuse, he said.

In November  Trojan was taken to the RSPCA tipping the scales at a hefty kg.That is a full kg heavier than an average female elephant at birth, Dorset Live reported.Just a year on, the lovable canine now comes in at a much healthier .kg and is said to be feeling much better for it. Kennel supervisor Nicola Anthony, who has been helping care for the Alaskan malamute in Dorset, explained: Poor Trojan was in a terrible way when he arrived here a year ago. He was dirty, matted and unbelievably obese. Do you have a hefty pet  Email webnews@mirror “It’s taken a year, a very special diet and an exercise regime to help him lose the weight slowly and safely and he’s now almost half of his original weight. Thankfully, he hasn’t lost his big character.” However, the senior pooch is now looking for a home that can keep his previous health and age in mind when taking him on. Trojan suffers from arthritis and thyroid problems so will need ongoing treatment in his new home. These conditions wonapost be covered by any insurance, so any potential owners will need to be prepared to cover costs. Nicola added: “Although he’s in his twilight years, don’t let that fool you he has no intention of ‘retiring’ any time soon. He is still strong and likes to go for short walks, plod around the garden and have a good snf. He gets on really well with other dogs but doesn’t like being jumped all over so he’s best around calm, respectful doggy friends. Trojan is looking for a home where he’ll have good company, regular grooming and be the only dog.  Nicola said: “While the festive season may be a time to join together with family and friends, many animals, like Trojan, will be waiting patiently to find their new family in an RSPCA rescue centre. It will cost us £, to run an animal centre for one day this winter so we’re asking animal lovers to join the aposRescue this Christmasapos to make sure animals get the care they need this winter.” RSPCA chief veterinary officer Caroline Allen said: “Pet obesity is a serious welfare issue and recent studies have suggested that around half of all pet dogs are overweight. We are, quite literally, killing our pets with kindness. Obesity can affect all types of pets and the main causes are from eating too much or not exercising enough. As a rough guide , you should be able to see and feel the outline of their ribs without excess fat covering them. You should also be able to see and feel their waist and it should clearly ‘pinch in’ when you look down at them from above. Overweight pets can suffer from serious health problems such as heart disease and diabetes and carrying more body weight than needed can also increase the chances of pets suffering from conditions such as arthritis and can even shorten their le expectancy. The RSPCA have stressed the importance of sticking to healthy diets for dogs and not to overfeed or overtreat them, especially with Christmas approaching.

To say I hate it is perhaps a bit harsh, but I do have a very strong dislike to it and here’s why. Firstly, I really cannot be bothered. The time and effort that goes into having an Elf come to stay is time and effort that I really don’t have at this time of year. Parent admin is never-ending as it is, and there is so much more during December – I barely keep up with what my kids need throughout the month.I definitely don’t need to add a Twinkletoeson top.  I once thought about jumping on the elf bandwagon, until my daughter was at a friendaposs house and one freaked her out. You see, many young children have vivid imaginations and I have spent many hours reassuring both my children that their teddy hasn’t moved all by itself. or that ghosts and monsters are not real. I am not then going to welcome an Elf into the house – who quite frankly is creepy as… - and undo all my hard work. Then there is the worry that the Elf is going to wake me in the dead of night and remind me that I haven’t moved it, as so many parents report. Sleep is precious, the kids now sleep through - Iaposm not allowing an Elf to ruin it!  It isn’t just a case of moving little Elfie about the house though - the pressure is on parents now to get creative. Kids want to be surprised by Twinkletoes’ shenanigans. Undecorating the tree, ‘pooping’ in the Cheerios, or using toilet paper as a parachute to swing from the chandelier, after leaving flour footprints and chaos in its wake. It’s a naughty elf and, isn’t that just a little hypocritical  I mean, sending an elf to watch the kids and report back to Santa, while being less than well behaved itself  For me, the whole concept is unnecessary. As a kid, the threat was just that Santa was watching. How he was watching never occurred to me, but I always knew that he would be there.You see, telling your kids that Santa won’t come is an empty threat, which I think most parents - including myself - have said several times throughout December. But which parent is actually going to follow that one through and leave their kid with no presents on Christmas Day I am very up for people doing Christmas their own way, and soyou love Elf on the Shelf, that’s fine - but you sure as hell wonapost find one in my house.Do you do Elf on the Shelf for your kids  Have your say in the comments belowRead MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Father ChristmasMichael BubleElf on the ShelfChristmas decorations\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Channay, who posts under the username @cleaningmum, said she had been handed a notice by her landlord telling her she has to be out of the property by January, even though she’s the one who did all the work on the house. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She wrote in one video: “When you’ve just spent ££££ on the house you live in for the landlord to give you a notice to leave by January. What a f***ing joke.” The clip showed off some areas of the house, looking very clean and chic with lots of grey and white furniture - a home that the likes of Mrs Hinch would surely love. And in update videos, she claimed that her landlord never kept up with any maintenance jobs on the house, so she was always left to do it herself. She added: “When your landlord doesn’t keep up with the maintenance so you do it yourself and then he puts it up for sale. F***ing great.”  Channay then said she would be “homeless” by January, as she has nowhere  to move to. The mum’s videos went viral and received mixed comments, as while some were sympathetic to her situation, others said she shouldn’t have decorated a house that wasn’t hers. One person wrote: “I thought it was common knowledge that it’s not a good idea to invest in doing up a rental... because it’s not yours.” While another disagreed, posting: “Everyone’s saying she shouldn’t have done up the house however, some people like to live comfortably regardless where they live.” As someone  said: “Take everything with you. And I mean everything that you paid for to improve the house.” And a fourth person added: “Put the house back as they left it and take everything you paid for. Because it seems to me like they wanted to sell after you already fixed the place up.

Click here to sign up.When she was just eight years old, Aiko refused to go to school because she said she was the victim of bullying.She was eventually persuaded toto the classroom but onlyher mother could go too. It was some time before she felt confident to go to school on her own. Aiko’s parents tried to make her school days more bearable by regularly inviting her classmates to the palace. An investigation revealed that she had suffered “violent things” from boys in another class. The school, however, explained away the incident, claiming that two boys accidentally collided with her, “which scared her”. Health problems  In October , there were more worries about the princess when she missed nearly two months from school due to an unspecied illness. Palace officials confirmed the teenager had been complaining of stomach problems and dizziness, which they attributed to studying for exams as well as practising for an athletics event. She later attended Gakushuin Girls’ Senior High School, where the princess was able to spend three months studying at Eton in Britain, staying in a boarding house. Aiko then started accompanying her parents on royal duties after her father ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne in . She is currently enrolled at Gakushuin University, where she has been attending online classes due to the Covid pandemic.According to the Japan Times, she studies Japanese literature, English and Spanish as well as Japanese history and traditional art.In September, she moved from the Akasaka Imperial Residence to the Imperial Palace with her parents taking her dog Yuri and cats Mii and Seven with her. Entering royal le  Now she has turned , Aiko will be formally welcomed into public le in a ceremony set to take place on Sunday. While dressed in formal attire, she will visit sanctuaries where the Imperial Familyaposs ancestors are buried and offer prayers to the gods, as well as be greeted by her parents and grandparents. Part of her formal attire will be a tiara, however itaposs been reported that the one she will wear for the ceremony will be a second-hand one - and not made especially for her. The tiara she will wear was first made for her aunt Princess Sayako but it is thought that the piece is being adjusted so it fits her perfectly on her big day. Itaposs said that there was some surprise in Japan, when it was announced that no new tiara was being made for the occasion. Future le  Once her official coming-of-age ceremony is out of the way, it is believed Aikoaposs first public appearance will be on New Yearaposs Day, when members of Japanaposs Imperial Family meet with well-wishers at Tokyoaposs Imperial Palace. She will also continue her university studies and in March will appear at a traditional coming-of-age news conference. However, depending on how Aikoaposs adult le pans out, her time in Japanaposs Imperial Family could be short.Thataposs becausea female member of the Imperial Family marries a commoner, she will lose her royal status and even her title.Earlier this year, her cousin Princess Mako was forced to relinquish her title when she married her commoner long-term love Kei Komuro.Before Makoaposs wedding, there were emotional scenes when she was forced to say goodbye to her parents and younger sister Kako at the entrance to their home.Though all wore masks in line with Japanaposs coronavirus protocol, her mother could be seen blinking rapidly, asto fight off tears.Mako bowed formally to her parents but her sister grabbed her shoulders and the two shared a long embrace. Chrysanthemum Throne  Of course, Aiko may choose not to marry - but despite being the only child of the Emperor, she will not ascend to the throne because women are not allowed to rule over Japan. In Japan there are just three heirs to the throne, Emperor Naruhito’s younger brother Crown Prince Akishino, , his son Prince Hisahito, , and the emperor’s uncle Prince Hitachi, . Experts have warned the royal line could completely vanishthe Imperial House Law is not revised. In , an expert  called for a revision to the law to allow the imperial couple’s first born, regardless of gender, to ascend the throne. But this was halted with the birth of Prince Hisahito in  - the was the first male member of the Imperial Family born in nearly  years. There are also fears that banning women from marrying outside the nobility, effectively forcing them to leave the Royal Familythey chose to wed, means the busy schedule of official duties is falling onto fewer and fewer people. Relaxing the rules is popular in Japan, with  per cent of people said to be supportive of allowing women to become emperors, not least because it would keep the monarchy relevant in an ever-changing world. But Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe was reportedly against allowing women to rule, believing that because the throne has consistently been passed down through the male line, it should continue the same way.

Richard Godfrey says he has been using new tracking technology that he claims has allowed him to locate the Boeing - , believing it is ,ft below the surface. The technology works using “tripwires” around the globe and when the plane hits one the signal changes. The Malaysia Airlines plane disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March , , with  people on board. The aviation engineer now claims that he has been able to track the plane’s final movements using a new system called weak signal propagation. Mr Godfrey told Australiaaposs  News it was like having a “bunch of tripwires that work in every direction over the horizon to the other side of the globe.”He has reportedly combined this new technology with data from the satellite communications system onboard the plane to track its path. “Together the two systems can be used to detect, identy and localise MH during its flight path into the Southern Indian Ocean,” he reportedly said. He believes that the plane is about , miles west of Perth at the base of what is known as Broken Ridge, an underwater plateau with ravines and a volcano.  In his report he states that the plane crashed at .am. He is now “very confident” that he has found the plane. “We have quite a lot of data from the satellite, we have oceanography, drt analysis, we have the performance data from Boeing, and now this new technology, he said. “All four align with one particular point in the Indian Ocean.”  He also has a theory for the crash and believes that it was deliberately carried out by the pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah as a terrorism act and the captain wanted the plane to “disappear in one of the remotest places in the world.” There is optimism that it could be the location of the plane as it is not far from where other searches have taken place. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau did not include it in an initial attempt to find the plane in  but the spot is at the northern part of the  extended search area. A dferent search in  by the US run Ocean Infinity went just  miles wide of the location.

The model, from Egypt, says she is full of confidence after she was bullied for her condition as a childReham Soliman, , was diagnosed with vitiligo when she was  Image: mediadrum@rehamsolimaByAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Dec | commentsA woman with a skin condition has been called Meghan Markle with vitiligo after becoming a model.Reham Soliman, , was diagnosed with vitiligo when she was  and it has since spread to more than  per cent of her body.Growing up, she was bullied for her skin condition and grew to resent it, until six years ago when she decided to stop caring what people thought. Reham, from Cairo, Egypt, was then approached by a modelling agency in  that wanted to feature her in a skincare brand.Now she gets told she looks likeMeghan Markle with vitiligo. She said: Growing up as my vitiligo started spreading, children called me cow and clown. I noticed twice that people did not want to shake my hand as they believed vitiligo is contagious. There were situations in university where people did not want to sit beside me. They would purposefully change the direction they were going in, I have been stared at in the streets all my le.  People come up to me to ask me whataposs wrong with my face, whether I am a burn victim orI do not know how to apply makeup. My friends, however, have often commented that I look like Meghan Markle with vitiligo. That is why I was so surprised when a skincare brand approached me for a modelling opportunity.  It was an unbelievable experience and I have seen how it has encouraged so many other people to accept their dferences. Reham did say that modelling isnapost always enjoyable and not always a great experience. She said: A while ago I was approached by a modelling agency that wanted to feature me as a erse model. However, when I went to their studio they had me in for a completely dferent photoshoot in a dferent category called TODAA.  They were classying people with unique characteristics and just using the veil of ersity for publicity. I asked them not to use my pictures and I was very disappointed by the agency as a whole after that incident. I have vitiligo but I am still a human being, I do not like being pigeonholed and categorised and locked in a corner. Overall, Reham believes her being so confident in her skin has encouraged others to accept their flaws. She said: I get a lot of positive feedback from people all over the world for my pictures that I did not accept. And not just from the vitiligo community but from anyone that does not fit into societyaposs standards of beauty. People with weight or health problems approach me to say that seeing me makes them feel alright with being dferent. People can be dferent and still live their lives and be happy.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

spread it to other people.ldquoI think there does need to be inidual choice in this and people have dferent perceptions of risk and dferent levels of desire to go to these events, and I think we should respect that.On whether the UK has not gone hard enough with its measures against Omicron, Prof Hayward said: ldquoI think itrsquos really very hard to judge these uncertainties and I think it does have to be a political decision.He said of the measures that were left: ldquoObviously wersquove introduced more masking into public transport and in shops, but we could be introducing that into

intensication of social mixing just in the run-up to Christmas and the timing of that is a bit unfortunate, given these circumstances.ldquoIrsquom not saying that those events should be stopped or banned, but I think, you know, people might think about spending more time outside, trying to keep more of a distance, wearing masks at them, potentially taking tests before they go and potentially taking tests after theyrsquove been to one and before they go and visit their relatives at Christmas.On Tuesday evening, the Prime Minister urged people not to cancel Christmas parties or school

Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

But the three aforementioned experts want us to rip all that out in preference for their as-yet only alternative, the totally impractical AHS pumps. No thank you: back to the drawing board for that idea, as the last few days has proved where.And by the way, the diesel four by four SUV kept us mobile during that week and able to render assistance to others less fortunate than ourselves.Neil Arthur, Kilpatrick, Isle of Arran.FOSSIL FUELS ARE LIFE-SAVERSPEOPLE should be prepared for power cuts. Torches, preferably the LED type, should be kept ready along with a stock of long-le batteries. Camping gas lanterns provide illumination for hours. Spare butane propane cylinders should be available, and spare mantles. Cooking can be done on small camping gas stoves. A propane cylinder connected to a gas heater gives a lot of warmth, with a CO detector as a precaution. In case the water supply fails, a few sealed five-litre plastic bottles of spring water will fill the gap.It is interesting to note that all these useful items depend on fossil fuels ndash plastics from oil, gas, steel which requires coking coal, and diesel machines to mine zinc and manganese . We depend on the products of oil, gas and coal in so many ways. Keeping fossil fuels in the ground is definitely not a good idea.William Loneskie, Lauder.* DAYS and days of no power. Tall trees left growing too close to power lines is the laziness of idiots.Clear them now, no excuses its not rocket science but good old-fashioned common sense.And future-proof the Grid.Tom Begg, Lochwinnoch.WE NEED ANSWERS TO GRID CONCERNSIT is worth noting that Hunterston Reactor  has in the last few days moved to its final defuelling phase and \"will notto power generation\" according to the French owners EDF Status website today, so another MW of stabilising synchronous generation has now been lost to Scotland. The remaining Reactor  is due to stop generating in January, which will leave west Scotland with worryingly low network strengthdue to our increasing reliance on renewables even though the HVDC interconnector from Wales terminates in the locality. This will affect the electrical protection response when there is network fault.In addition, National Grid in  published its concerns that HVDC links will in many circumstances not be able to transfer power when feeding low-strength areas of the network. This identied that when nearby network faults occur there will be many scenarios where the HVDC AC converters will become unstable and our AC voltage will start to surge and oscillate at a dferent frequency to the Hzthat we receive in our homes, which will necessitate shutdown, meaning Scotland could not import.I, along with many, would like to hear from Scottish Power, EDF, which owns Hunterston, and SSEN that they have fully responded to National Grids  request for input to \"further explore the risk to converter instability\" and that we can be confident such problems have been solved.DB Watson, Cumbernauld.KEEPING IN TOUCH IN POWER CUTSOUR thoughts are with communities who have experienced the effects of Storm Arwen and our focus has been on getting everyone reconnected as quickly as possible.Wersquove been upgrading the nationrsquos home phones to Digital Voice and more than one million customers are benefiting already from the high-definition calling it brings.

However, whilst the statement may be correct, the conclusions are not, since the cuts are based on relative numbers of train users between pre-Covid figures and those in the current survey.In fact,working from home becomes the new normal for a majority of Scots, then further cuts may be required next spring to match the services to that of customer demand.

It will take time to change that situation and involve action at a local and national government level.\"The short term lettings market both brings people to the islands, and removes properties from the local market.\"This results in a lack of affordable housing and long term rentals. Isle showed me that there is both an appetite to support the Scottish islands - because people feel a real affinity with them - and that there is a huge power in working together as island communities. \"As a social enterprise, all profits after running the business must by law be reinvested into the communities they serve. For the purposes of Isle Develop CIC, that community is the Scottish islands.Isle Develop CIC have supported fisherman Callum Williams, Kirsty Bennet and their sons after they opened aseafood shop on Tiree this summer\"IsleHoliday is an attempt to harness that to make sure that more of the money generated by our housing stock stays in the islands. Airbnb dont need that commission, but our island communities could make excellent use of it,\" said Ms Meek.\"Our goal is to use it to generate revenue which can be used to the benefit of our communities - particularly in relation to affordable housing and long term rental options for residents.\"Ministers have been seeking to tackle the growth of rentals on s like Airbnb and popular tourist areas by giving local councils powers to set up licensing schemes and charge fees to cover their costs.New laws tabled by the Scottish Government mean that properties used for short-term lets will need licences by .Ministers want to increase regulation of short-term rental properties in response to concerns raised by some communities about spiralling rents and claims of disruption.IsleHoliday will list holiday lets from across the Scottish islands, allowing visitors to book and make payments, but thatrsquos where the similarity with other s ends.Ms Meek added: ldquoWhen you book your holiday house through isleHoliday, % of the profit will go back into our island communities.\"We know our Bernerays from our Burras! By working together with accommodation providers and local organisations we can offer rich information about island le before visitors arrive from driving on single track roads to public facilities, events and great local businesses to visit during their stay.ldquoVisitors will have a better experiencewe correctly set their expectations. Our islands are not empty wildernesses waiting to be discovered. They are full of heritage and history, present and we hope, future. Those are gems well worth discovering.ldquoWe want to put faces to places and start to change the narrative from destination first, to community first.The group are accepting property listings from any Scottish island, and there are already receiving Tiree - where the company is working in partnership with the local development trust - to Bernera in Lewis, and even Unst.\"She said that the dream would be to have the capital to enter into co-ownership of properties - either existing or new.But the plan at the momen is that all Isle Develop CIC surplus will go towards providing small grants to micro businesses to purchase pieces of equipment which will help them become more sustainable year round.It will also help directly fund housing surveys, projects and campaigns relating to long term affordable island accommodation.Ms Meek said they have already funded two small businesses to purchase crucial pieces of equipment."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13252233.jpg?type=article-full","title":"backlash-edinburgh-based-tsb-shuts-quarter-network-branches","story":"TSB is shutting a further  branches ndash a quarter of its network ndash in a move described by campaigners as ldquoyet another hammer blow to the UK high street.Some  jobs are set to go with the Edinburgh-based bank saying the latest closures are in response to declining branch use and more customers using digital services.The Scottish branches closing are: Coldside, Dundee , Ellon , Forfar , Forres , Fort William , Kirkintilloch , Lanark , Stranraer , ThursoIt comes a year after it announced it was shutting  bank branches and a cut of around  jobs despite appeals to save branches in remote and most deprived areas of Scotland.Fourteen months ago TSB had  branches, but these latest cuts ndash following a wave of previous closures in  and this year ndash mean that by the end of June  this number will have more than halved to .Kirkintilloch TSBDr Jackie Mulligan, the founder of ShopLocalOnline.org and one of the government-commissioned High Streets Task Force experts, said: ldquoThis news is yet another hammer blow to the UK high street, which is already reeling after nearly two years of pain.Dr Mulligan added: ldquoThe sht online is irreversible, but so, too, is the damage that a bank leaving a high street can cause for the shops that surround it.

Greater scrutiny of branch closures must be in place to ensure that people who rely on cash can access it. The government must urgently press ahead with long-promised legislation that guarantees consumers can continue to access cash for as long as it is needed.\"Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union added: \"TSB axing a quarter of its branches in , on top of the numbers already closed, is a bitter blow for many communities.\"Unite has consistently argued that local banking and access to cash is essential especially for those on lower incomes.\"TSB said there will be no closures where it is the only bank left in the town, and it will open  more pop-up branches.TSBrsquos chief customer officer Robin Bulloch said: ldquoClosing branches is an incredibly dficult decision to take, but we have to respond to the changes in the way people bank and provide the right mix of services for all our customers now and into the future.ldquoThese changes allow us to maintain an extensive branch presence across the country.\"They are accompanied by a signicant investment programme to upgrade branches to better suit customer needs.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change.

In those circumstances, we would ask friends, family and neighbours to keep an eye on people who may be experiencing problems as a result – and dial  to report any power issues. “We would ask that people ensure that anything that could be blown about is safely stowed away or tied down – strips of plastic or polythene, for instance, can cause power cutsthey get wrapped around power lines.”Weather and transport updates are available on the OIC Updates Facebook page and on the @OrkneyCouncil and @OrkneyPolice Twitter feeds.Readyscotland.org has a list of tips to stay safe including:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

We thought there would be more, they said in a technical briefing today. Enhanced contract tracing is underway.The case involves recent travel to one of the southern African countries and was linked to a positive case last week.The suspected cases were identied by an S-gene dropout characteristic which it exhibits, but the dominant iant in Ireland, Delta, does not. This trait can be spotted by standard PCR tests.Cases of Omicron identied in Nigeria have also dated as far back as October, suggesting the iant may have been far more widespread than previously thought earlier in the year.The concern around the iant from within the scientic community stems from the number of mutations it exhibits on its spike protein, the part of the virus that binds to human cells and infects people.The spike protein of Omicron is sufficiently dferent to previous strains that scientists have cause for concern it may be more transmissible than previous strains of Covid- but may also evade the antibody response produced by the immune system and vaccines.There is still much work to be done on this iant to confirmit is more transmissible or whether it has vaccine-escaping properties, though, the scientic community has cautioned.Most of the reported cases of Omicron have been either mild or asymptomatic but a caveat to this is they are mostly among young people or people who are fully vaccinated, where cases would tend to be mild.There have been hospitalisations due to the iant in South Africa, Dr Angelique Coetzee confirmed in recent days.Any arrivals into the Republic of Ireland will now have to produce a PCR test  hours before travel or an antigen test  hours before travel in a bid to slow the spread of the iant in Ireland. This antigen test must be professionally conducted and cannot be a self-test purchased in a store.Most ReadColeraine tragedy: Tributes paid to Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw following sudden deathsFrancis Lagan funeral hears we#s tribute to #very best# husband and father as principal killed in Storm Arwen laid to restMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Disaster warning: Teaching union calls for December school ‘circuit breaker’ after , off with CovidTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKLatest CoronavirusSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandCircuit-breaker schools shutdown urged as heads tell of cancelled classesUUP defends Beattie’s US visit amid ‘work from home’ guidanceFive Northern Ireland people fined for not wearing face maskNI waiting list crisis: Seriously ill patients competing with each other for vital operations, senior medic warnsLatestPlans afoot to ‘silence’ community drugs organisations, says campaignerRape victims ‘lucky’their case gets to court within four years, MPs toldThree injured after Second World War bomb explodes at Munich construction siteHousing Finance Agency chief open to expanding retrofitting fundingChildren’s minister: Schools will stay open until Christmas holidays,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That flight had five passengers. But Epstein wasn’t one of them.He appears to have made his way from Dublin to Waterford by other means, but was picked up in Waterford by his private jet for a flight to Paris on May .When it took off, the passengers who had been on board that quick flight from Dublin to Waterford were no longer on board.It took off for Paris with just Epstein and one other passenger.After landing in Paris, Epstein’s jet later repositioned to Geneva, Switzerland.It departed there on May , , landing in Shannon to refuel before making its way to Teteboro the same day.The jet — dubbed the ‘Lolita Express’ — was pressed into action on June , , to go to Dublin from London’s Luton Airport. In Dublin, it picked up Epstein, Maxwell and Sarah Kellen — Epstein’s then personal assistant — before making its way to New York’s JKF airport.Later that year, on November , the jet made a journey from St Petersburg in Russia to Shannon.Epstein was on that flight, as was Maxwell, Kellen and another passenger who travelled on a number of flights on the Epstein jet. After landing in Shannon to refuel, the jet flew on to JFK airport in New York.In , the aircraft was back at Shannon, having arrived from Teteboro with just one passenger, and made its way on to Paris.Most ReadColeraine tragedy: Tributes paid to Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw following sudden deathsFrancis Lagan funeral hears we#s tribute to #very best# husband and father as principal killed in Storm Arwen laid to restMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Disaster warning: Teaching union calls for December school ‘circuit breaker’ after , off with CovidTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKLatest Northern IrelandOne case of Omicron confirmed in Republic of IrelandSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandCircuit-breaker schools shutdown urged as heads tell of cancelled classesUniversity staff take to picket lines in strike over pay and conditionsCo Armagh cannabis factory uncovered – manarrestedLatestHousing Finance Agency chief open to expanding retrofitting fundingChildren’s minister: Schools will stay open until Christmas holidaysImpatient Meerkats at London Zoo open entire advent calendar full of treatsFrench minister calls for European measures against UKfishing row talks failLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa surprised by Tyler Roberts’ performance in Palace win,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said it wasn’t easy to score for your country, and it’s not, we went through some tough times,” she added.Now we’re reaping the rewards for all the hard work we’ve put in through the years. Every goal I score for my country is special and hopefully there’s more to come.”NI, which has a smaller population to North Macedonia by nearly , people, beat the latter by - in their first game against them in the Women’s World Cup qualiers.“If we can get a draw against Austria, it could go down to the goal dference, and we’ve just scored  goals against North Macedonia,” added Armstrong.“Who ever heard of Northern Ireland beating anybody - or -  North Macedonia is probably much bigger than us!”Northern Ireland are now secured in the play-off spot in Group D for the World Cup qualiers, two points below leaders England, albeit having played a game more.Austria who also have a game in hand, are in third place currently but can regain the second spot when they travel to Luxembourg on Tuesday.Related topicsNorthern Ireland Football TeamMore On Northern Ireland Football Team PremiumNorthern Ireland’s women will progress even further, say confident Simone Magill and Rachel FurnessNorthern Ireland’s all-time leading goalscorer Rachel Furness proud to break David Healy’s long-standing recordNorthern Ireland put on a show for Rachel Furness’ historic night PremiumRachel Furness on ‘buzz’ of David Healy’s congratulations text and how chronic knee issues haven’t held her back from Northern Ireland record PremiumShayne Lavery explains why it ‘hurt’ to watch Northern Ireland face Italy without him as Blackpool star prepares to put injury woes in the pastMost ReadColeraine tragedy: Tributes paid to Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw following sudden deathsFrancis Lagan funeral hears we#s tribute to #very best# husband and father as principal killed in Storm Arwen laid to restDisaster warning: Teaching union calls for December school ‘circuit breaker’ after , off with CovidMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Top VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKLatest Northern IrelandOne case of Omicron confirmed in Republic of IrelandSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandCircuit-breaker schools shutdown urged as heads tell of cancelled classesUniversity staff take to picket lines in strike over pay and conditionsCo Armagh cannabis factory uncovered – manarrestedLatestImpatient Meerkats at London Zoo open entire advent calendar full of treatsFrench minister calls for European measures against UKfishing row talks failLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa surprised by Tyler Roberts’ performance in Palace win‘Allow older drivers to escape prosecution for running red lights’First case of Omicron confirmed in Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Council will now look at ways to allocate resources to establish a new Greenway link connecting Judges Road to the proposed site for the ‘Rural Greenway Hub’ at the Auld School Site on Temple Road. Councillor Fleming said: “This would be transformational. It would be a greater use and safer use of the Country Park, Gransha Woods andEnaghLough. “Also, it would mean the site, known to people as the old school and Church site, being brought back into use. This won’t just have an effect on the locality ofStrathfoylePark but also the city and greater district.Councillor Ferguson continued: “The Lough is on my doorstep and even I don’t know its full history. It has its own eco-system. “It is a rural hub and over lockdown, many people have discovered the Lough and have used it for a number of activities. It is a very rural area and this has impacted on many residents. “We are hoping with the aspirations for theEnaghLough country park that some of these issues would be addressed. “We are asking to secure a connection from theStrathfoylegreenway to the Lough and Gransha area which would be impactful for the new houses so they could actively walk or cycle to the Lough. “It would link the moss area to, hopefully, a country hub at the old school where safe parking could be accessed. “If we were to overlook this small connection, we would be overlooking an absolute gem in the area.” The Council also hopes in time toexpand the Greenway within the district to areas such as Eglinton. Councillor Mooney added:I was struck by the work that has already gone into this concept. Thisisa rural tourism project that will seek to bring eco, adventure, cultural and rural tourism within the site.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Council will write toDfIfor investment in roads as a “matter of urgency.” Councillor Sandra Duffy brough the motion to Council and said that despite an allocation toDfI, with astructuralbudget of pound million, Derry roads are “not seeing the benefit of that investment”. CouncillorDuffy said that currently motorists were “dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment”. Councillor Duffy described the roads in and out ofGalliaghas “patchwork quilts that have been filled and refilled.” Councillors supported the motion with many bringing forward their constituents concerns over potholes and road conditions. Councillor McCready said: “I have been on roads in Baghdad and Kabul and the roads are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland.” Councillor McKinney described the situation as a disgrace. He said: “There are parts of our district where the roads and the traffic system are like driving in a third world country. I have written on many occasions to the DfI roads, only to be told there are no funds. Councillor Reilly added: “All the councillors havedemonstratedthat there are issues affecting the roads in their area and that is an historical issue.” Councillor Devenney described the conditions of the roads as the worst he has seen them in at least  years. Due to a legal challenge, the resurfacing contracts for the council area have been delayed to next year. The pound.m resurfacing programme locally for the year up to March  had included the Clooney Road between Caw and Gransha Roundabouts, Church Street, Claudy,BarnailtRoad,Glensha neRoad,Killalooto Claudy and theArdloughRoad. As well as this, Circular Road,Creggan,PrehenPark,Le namoreRoad, Talbot Park, Maybrook Park, Larkhill,DrumleckDrive, St. Canice’s Park, Eglinton, Bluebell Hill Gardens.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Cllr Duffy who is Sinn Feacuteins local health spokesperson and also represents the Ballyarnett ward, said the JCVIs recommendation was welcome but it was vital that current health advice on mask wearing be adhered to in order to enhance the protection given by the booster. She said: “The announcement that the booster vaccine programme has been extended to include younger people is very welcome. “The COVID booster vaccination has been shown to be highly effective at preventing serious illness and the spread of the virus. “It is also notable that the gap between the second and third dose is to be cut to three months in an effort to stymie the further spread of COVID-. “While these measures are welcome it must be remembered that vaccines are but one tool in the kit. “It is vital that the Department of Health have an optimal level of testing and tracing in constant operation and that we all observe public health advice on hygiene and mask wearing. “Together all these tools can work to keep us safe and to reduce the pressures being endured by our health and social care workers.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.” The Derry News contacted the Derry Chamber of Commerce to comment in response to the DTUCs survey results but they declined to do so.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.” The Derry News contacted the Derry Chamber of Commerce to comment in response to the DTUCs survey results but they declined to do so.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mr Martin says the Government will have to keep its options open on further restrictions, explaining: NPHET have put in a caveat also that further measures can not be ruled out...can be very honest about that. His warning has been echoed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, who said that it is impossible to saythere could be a lockdown in the future. Minister Donnelly added that whilea lockdown cannot be ruled out, it is not where we are currently as a nation. Other measures that are due to be introduced by the govt include: People will be told to work from home, under recommendation from NPHETVaccine passes will be required to access theatres and cinemas but not at hairdressers, barbers or gymsStrict rules around mask wearing for indoor and outdoor settings.  In addition to the new rules, two other measures aimed at reducing transmission of the virus were also revealed.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

Pic by MonoPix.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, As the victorious Na Magha team came off the pitch at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday, one supporter signalled to manager Dee Doherty to keep hold of the black armbands. googletag.cmd.push The bands, worn by every member of the squad, were worn in memory of club stalwart Seaacuten Mellon, who passed away this month, and who coached many of the current senior team at one stage. Under the stand, with the inimitable sounds of championship victory coming from the changing room, Doherty said Seaacuten Mellons fingerprints were all over the win. “Theres not too many boys in that changing room that havent been coached by Seaacuten at some stage, whether it was underage or senior,” he told the County Derry Post. “He was an absolute legend of hurling in Derry and had a massive impact on the game today to be honest. Breandaacuten Quigley fields a high ball. Pic by MonoPix. “I would say we tried to keep the emotion out of it, and just used it to drive the boys on,” he added. The sight of Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin reeling off under the floodlights was greeted with joy in the stands, but also with a certain degree of relief. Having looked untroubled throughout the first half, Cootehill had forced their way back into the game and trailed by just a point going into the final quarter. “It was nervous enough at one stage,” said Doherty. “When we played the first half and talked about it in the changing room at half time, we thought we were fairly well in control. “Then we came out in the second half, and they put the pressure on us, and had it down to a one-point game at one stage.  Na Magha seal Ulster semi final spot with blistering final quarter  Ruaidhriacute McLaughlins th minute goal saw off a stubborn Cootehill side at Breffni Park.   “We talked about how we had let them back into it again, and we needed a big - minutes of hurling out of them. “Then Ruaidhriacute went up and scored the goal for us, and that sort of gave us a wee bit of a cushion. “To be fair, they responded well. I thought the subs came in and freshened things up, the likes of young Keelan there and boys like that helped us get a few scores.” There was a certain degree of rustiness on display. Na Magha had not had a competitive game since October  after Coleraine were unable to field in the junior final. However, with the cobwebs hopefully blown away, Doherty is looking towards the next game. “The big problem at the minute is that were in this competition and we havent won our county championship, so the preparations werent ideal,” he said. “Weve got a couple of challenge games in, which is the best we could do, but obviously not getting to play your county final meant we had no competitive games and we were very rusty. “Everybody wants to get to the final, but were in the semi final first, so hopefully we can get through that and see how it goes. “Weve a fair bit of work to do before this next game against Carrickmacross in two weeks time.”  Deep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away  Seaacuten Mellon was one of the founding members of Na Magha CLG.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A satisfied James McNicholl shted back and forth underneath the Owenbeg stand, trying to shake the effects of an hour and a half on the sideline in Storm Arwen. googletag.cmd.push His Dungiven side had just sealed back-to-back Jack Cassidy Cup titles with a win over Loup and with the howling wind muting the celebrations slightly, he had his eye on the future. “Hopefully we can get a springboard from this into senior football,” he told the County Derry Post. “We won in , and any momentum we would have got was halted with Covid and obviously that was more important at the time.  Derry GAA vice chairman Kieran McKeever presents the Jack Cassidy cup to Dungiven joint captains Darragh McGilligan and Cahair Higgins. Pic by Mary K Burke. “Weve four or five starting on the senior team there and most of the  lads are senior footballers now. There is plenty there to work with over the next couple of years. “[With Geoffrey in] its exciting times for the players and you know theyll buy into it. The talent is there – its always been there, but sometimes other things get in the way. “We are where we are as a senior team, thats the way the league tables are, and hopefully now well kick on and in four or five years time well be back in that conversation further up the table.” Despite a Carl Lagan goal bringing the deficit to just one in the second half, McNicholls St Canices side looked controlled and composed throughout the encounter. McNicholl said the elements had ruined the game as a spectacle, but that his side had a plan for managing the situation. “We got settled down at half time. We were a wee bit nervous and passes were going astray in the first half, but I thought we controlled it really well after half time,” he said.  Dungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles  A late Niall McGonagle penalty stretched the winning margin to five.   “There was such a big breeze in the first half the conditions dictated the game to be honest. Its nearly too big a breeze at times we were kicking the ball out of play and that. “Look, we worked on it, weve done it in training, so it was a matter of taking it from the training field onto the pitch.” “Its all about patience. We work hard on isolating one-on-ones and getting at your man, andyou cant do that in Gaelic football, you shouldnt be in the team. “The spaces will always open up at some point, it was a very defensive first half from them, and rightly so, they were facing a big breeze. “We knew theyd be there in the second half, but it just takes a bit of time. You get a bit of luck as well, but they knew they had it in them,” he added.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

Steph Graham was next to cross the line for the club in .. She is a new addition to the EDAC ranks having transferred from City of Lisburn AC.It was idly rumoured that her recent marriage to club member Gordy Graham had cited this move in a pre-nuptial contract but in reality it came down to her now being closer to Downpatrick than her previous training grounds.While she is sad to leave her previous longterm club, she knows that she will be warmly welcomed by all in East Down.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know. I canrsquot answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider. He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason forgoing into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border, and a bomb attack on her school bus driver in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.ldquoIt was a very strange time, she said. ldquoMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I donrsquot know what she was doing but I will never forget her face. She just froze.Ms Foster said it was not politically correct to say it, but she felt she benefited from being educated at an all-girl school, where she grew in confidence.The former political leader said she was enjoying her new role in journalism as a presenter on GB news - but said more must be done to tackle the hurtful abuse on social media particularly against women.Mrs Foster was welcomed by Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, who said her personal story was incredibly interesting.He remarked: ldquoArlene Foster was extremely gracious and gave very generously of her time and people in the audience responded to her warmth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  November 28%2C 2001  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Angry traders in Downpatrick have this week called for tougher action to be taken against teenagers terrorising local businesses.They are demanding that the townrsquos police commanders are provided with additional resources to take the problem and that the courts hand out much stfer sentences.Their call comes amid mounting concern about the behaviour of an umber of juveniles who are verbally abusing and intimidating female staff in shops throughout the town and stealing from businesses.Traders say they are becoming increasingly frustrated that no punitive action is taken against the teenagers when they appear before the courts and that the sentences handed out to them are too light.The current position is so serious that number of shop owners are locking their doors during opening hours and admitting customers only after a visual check.One local trader, who did not want to be named, said the teenagers responsible for the trouble were being allowed to intimidate the business community and suggested an exclusion order should be placed on them, banning them from the town.ldquoThese people have no fear and no shame and walk about the town asthey owned the place.

Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Booster vaccination can now be given from three months of completion of the primary course.Welcoming the expansion, Mr. Swann said: ldquoOur booster programme will now in many ways mirror the primary dose vaccination programme which steadily moved its way down through the dferent age groups over a number of months.ldquoI would again urge people not to be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due to concerns or speculation about the Omicron iant.ldquoIt remains very likely that vaccination will continue to protect against severe illness from Omicron as it does against other iants of SARS-CoV-.ldquoIn addition, our vaccines provide very good protection against the Delta iant, which remains the predominant strain in Northern Ireland at this point.The Minister revealed details of Health Trust vaccination hubs and clinics that are opening this week across Northern Ireland, complementing the ongoing vaccination work of GPs and local pharmacies, signicantly increasing the systemrsquos capacity to deliver boosters.In addition, the pharmacy sector is finalising plans for a special weekend of additional walk-in booster vaccination clinics this Saturday and Sunday .In the first instance, most Trust vaccination hubs and clinics will principally focus on boosters for the over-s.Anyone in this category should be called by their GP but can also attend Community Pharmacy or Trust Centresthey have not yet received their booster.Trust centres are also providing ongoing first- and second-doses for all eligible age groups and will open soon to the - year olds for their booster doses.People in the -plus age range now have a choice of waiting to be invited in by their GP for their booster, or going to a local pharmacy or the Trust Centres.The ision of roles between the vaccine providers will be kept under ongoing review and is likely to be updated in the coming weeks.Most Trust vaccination hubs are offering both walk-in and booked appointments.

Photo: Declan Roughan   Press EyeDuring a debate on a Bill designed to make the NI Executive more stable, Lord Dodds said that the integrity of the UK internal market has been “breached by the Northern Ireland Protocol,” Introducing the Bill for its second reading, Lord Caine Lord Caine said: “The Bill faithfully implements the commitments of the UK Government as set out in New Decade, New Approachto make the devolved institutions more resilient and more sustainable.”.Lord Dodds said that unless agreement is reached between the UK and the EU on how to remove the Irish Sea trade border, or the Article  clause activated by the UK Government, then “that will have the inevitable consequence of making the institutions which we are debating here tonight inoperable”.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Lord Dodds said: “If neither of those happens, unionists in the Executive will of course be in a completely untenable position”.He added: “It is important that, as we see progress on aspects of NDNA, we also see progress on that commitment, and that the Northern Ireland Protocol is addressed in a way which brings stability to the institutions in Northern Ireland we have yet to see that happen.“Of course, discussions are continuing and we are aware of those negotiations. People said that there could not be any renegotiation effectively, that is what is happening.“People said the original form of the protocol had to be rigorously implemented we have seen that bypassed. That is all good – it is progress – but the current discussions cannot be strung out much longer. We know the time has almost run out for those discussions, and by the end of the year it will have run out completely.”Lord Dodds went on to say: “Action will have to be taken, either in the form of an agreement between the European Union and the government, addressing the issues that are outstanding in all aspects – both constitutional and economic – or in the form of UK action to fully restore Northern Ireland’s position in the internal market and its constitutional integrity.“The invocation of Article  may or may not be part of that, but it can be only part of it, because it is not a solution in itself.“If neither of those happens, unionists in the Executive will of course be in a completely untenable position, where the political processes and the political balance will not exist in terms of the institutions.”Speaking during the same debate on Monday, Baroness Kate Hoey asked for an assurance that the NI Executive would be able to continue operating in the event of one of the largest parties staging a boycott – as happened when Sinn Fein walked out in . “Will the government give a commitment that,this should ever happen again and the Executive were to collapse, this would not happen again – evenit does offend the Dublin government ” Baroness Hoey said.“As many people have said, the proposed changes in the Bill have been made by the government to try to improve the stability of Northern Ireland institutions and to improve transparency and accountability.“It is rather ironic that we are talking about accountability when we have had discussions over the past few months on the protocol, where there has been no accountability.“Along with all the unionist, pro-Union parties in Northern Ireland, I am involved in the Court of Appeal action, which started again today.“It is absolutely fascinating, and it is worth telling your Lordships what the government have said today: they have gone back on their assertion that the Acts of Union are subject to implicit repeal, as they argued in court at the first hearing.“Instead, they have suggested that Section A merely suspends the Acts of Union for as long as the protocol exists.“What an incredible suggestion. It suggests that the very legal contract that is the Union – the Acts of Union – an be suspended as a requirement of the protocol. The implication is that, while the protocol remains, Northern Ireland’s position in the Union is suspended.”Baroness Hoey added: “But it is also important that, as has been pointed out, the New Decade, New Approach agreement of January  has, first, never actually been voted on or even debated in the Assembly. However, it is there and it is the agreement that we are working to – but this is only one aspect of it.“I join with other noble Lords who have said that they want to know when the rest of it – the bits that actually make a huge dference – will be brought in.“Some of the parties have been pushing particular aspects of it. It is very important that the government do not look at one area alone but at the whole thing. The question of internal trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in particular is absolutely crucial. We have to get that legislation very quickly.”Commenting on the new Troubles legacy legislation due to be introduced by the government – described by many as an effective ‘amnesty’ for Troubles-related offences – Baroness Hoey said: “We have had more than a dozen partial amnesties since the  Good Friday agreement, starting with the early release of prisoners, those guilty of the grossest abuses of human rights. In the terrible case of Patsy Gillespie, which the noble Lord, Lord Hain, mentioned,the person had been got for that at the time, probably now they would be out on a Royal pardon or some other way in which those guilty of the grossest abuse of human rights – murder – have been let off. “Those many parts of amnesty have been advocated, proposed and agreed by the Irish and British governments in the past, so I find it a little surprising that the Irish Government are getting so angry about this when, in the past, they have gone along with it and asked for it.“We will have to discuss this legacy Bill at some stage, but I hope that people will look at the past and the history of it before they make their decision.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That’s the appeal to the public from Health Minister Robin Swann, as public health measures are activated in response to the Omicron iant’s emergence. Mr Swann also underlined the continuing importance of vaccination in the battle against all strains of the virus. “Subject to the Speaker’s approval, I intend to update the Assembly on Monday in regard to the measures being deployed in response to the emergence of the Omicron iant,” the Minister said. “These include the addition of a number of countries to Northern Ireland’s Red List for international travel. “The emerging picture on the Omicron iant is being very closely monitored and we will continue to liaise with public health colleagues in the other UK jurisdictions and the Irish Republic.” The Minister urged everyone to adhere to the basic steps that will help stop the spread of all iants of COVID-. These include: getting vaccinated and getting your booster dose when eligible, wearing a face covering, limiting contacts, keeping rooms well-ventilated or meeting outdoors when possible, working from homepossible, and practising good hand hygiene. If you have symptoms of COVID- – a high temperature OR a new, continuous cough OR a loss of or change in sense of smell, or taste, no matter how mild – please isolate and get a PCR test as soon as possible. The Health Minister continued: “There are concerns that the Omicron iant may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines. That is not confirmed and it is important to emphasise that. “Furthermore, eventhis does turn out to be the case, it remains vital that as many people as possible get their first and second doses and their booster vaccines when eligible. “I have been assured that our vaccines should still provide a level of protection against Omicron. The importance of that cannot be overestimated. Secondly, we know that our vaccines are very effective against the Delta iant. Delta very much remains the predominant iant in NI at the current time, is a very real and present risk to our population, and is continuing to cause serious illness and, in some tragic cases, death to our fellow citizens.” Mr Swann continued: “Plans have been activated to identy any spread of the new iant in NI. “Using passenger locator data, the Public Health Agency is identying and contacting iniduals who have recently arrived in Northern Ireland from Red List countries. “They and their household members will be asked to self-isolate and undertake PCR tests. If any positive cases are detected, the sample will then undergo Whole Genome Sequencingto determine the iant type. If the new iant is confirmed here, all appropriate health protection actions will be carried out and the public will be informed as appropriate.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dddefcfabcdaac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfcbaffb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638199683305.jpg--covid_19___mon_29th_november_figures.jpg?163819968300","title":"covid  mon th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
