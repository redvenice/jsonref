Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds had a great few days but the Swedes got the jump on them early and never looked back. The Czech star has had two runs today, and both her opponents have come a cropper, with Poland’s Aleksandra Krol falling in the quarter finals. We’re now onto the men’s quarters. We’re on the 6th End, and the Swedes are having a complete lend. Oscar Eriksson, in particular, is in fine fettle. They’ve all but sown up the Bronze. ICYMI, Nathan Chen put on a clinic earlier  The Swedish pair are pitiless. The Power Play will kick off the second half. To the uninitiated, this is such a great sport to watch. It’s one-on-one, with plenty of mind games and technical brilliance. Ester Ledecka was safely through in the women’s quarters and now we’re on to the fellas. Russia’s Dmiitri Loginov has just been rolled and is Loginout of these Olympics. ’s take on the extraordinary Eileen Gu, one of the genuine superstars of these Games.  A steal of three to the pesky Swedes. ‘Shop Early’ as they say in Curling circles.  The second snowboarding medal event is now underway, with the men’s and women’s events running simultaneously, and the final being decided just two hours after qualifying. Ester Ledecka is the reigning champ and the hottest of favourites in the women’s event. She was the first athlete to compete in alpine skiing and snowboarding at an Olympics. She was also the first woman to win gold in two different disciplines at a Winter Olympics. This is her pet event. She was two seconds clear of anyone else in qualifying and appears to have a mortgage on the gold. Her stiffest competition is expected to come from Ramona Therasia Hosmeister (Germany), Daniela Ubling (Austria) and Ladina Jenny (Switzerland).  In the men’s competition, South Korea’s Lee Sangho was the fastest qualifier, while 22-year-old Russian Dmitri Loginov is looking to become the youngest man to win a medal in alpine snowboarding. I’ll be Loginov myself in about two hours. Sorry. To snare gold, he’ll have to top Benkamin Karl (Austria), Nevin Galmarini (Switzerland) and Zan Kosit (Slovenia).I have cursed the Brits. Half a second after pressing ‘go’ on that last update, the Swedes say ‘stuff you’ and unleash a 4 pointer! Thanks Beau, let’s kick off with some Curling, traditionally not my strong suit, but a crucial match nonetheless. At one point, the Brits were 4-2 the better of the husband and wife Norwegian pair. But Norway’s Kristin Skaslien had ice in her veins, and secured a berth in the big one. They’ll take on Italy, who gave Sweden a hiding, winning 8-1. Early in proceedings, the Brits are up 1-0 but the Swedes have conditions to suit (so I’m assured).But you have to wonder if Ann Marie Desbiens and the shot-blocking Canadian defense are in the USA’s heads now. Desbiens made 51 saves. Someone surely counted the number of blocks, and it’ll be equally staggering.  And on that note -- all yours, Jonathan. Good night from the USA.Sandra Weingart: “Cranky person is wrong. Quip away, especially if it’s snarky. Yes, I was watching Nathan Chen and the wonderful Jason Brown, who is extremely unlikely to medal but skates so beautifully, but its only 11 pm in the Mountain Time Zone and 10 out on the left coast, so the western half of America is still awake.” Jason Brown’s program was beautiful. Without quads, he won’t medal, but he’s fun to watch. Barbara Roden: “Cute quips’? Love them keep them coming! We Canucks take our hockey a bit too seriously sometimes, and it’s fun to read something that doesn’t treat every international game involving a Canadian hockey team as if we’re at mission control trying to get Apollo 13 back to Earth safely.” You should see what happens on US soccer Twitter when the men lose. (When the women lose, it’s always someone else’s fault or bad luck.) 2:40 left. Time to pull the goalie?Still the same story -- plenty of US possession, no goal. 4:00 left.The USA has outshot Canada 50-25. They’ve taken only two penalty minutes to Canada’s 10. And it’s still 4-2 Canada with 6:02 left. Meanwhile, the USA is outshooting Canada 10-3 in the third period.  Also, here’s my story asking whether women’s hockey can finally build a pro league in these two great women’s hockey countries. And here’s a picture of famous Canadians on an American TV show. You’d think putting in a picture of Rush (my favorite band) and gushing about curling (my favorite sport -- I oversaw a rental at our club earlier today) would win me some Canadian cred. I also love Metric, July Talk, Kids in the Hall, Whistler (even though I can’t stay), and Canada’s health-care system. All that’s left is for me to apply for citizenship.  So anyway -- the USA is getting a couple of good shots, but former University of Wisconsin goalie Ann Renee Desbiens is having a monster game as usual. And here are two Canadian colleagues for whom I have immense respect debating the merits of the penalty call. Remember Ester Ledecka? The Czech skiersnowboarding pulled off a ridiculous feat in 2018, winning this event and the Alpine skiing super-G. Let’s repeat. She won gold in snowboarding and Alpine skiing. That’s like winning bobsled and luge. Or cycling and ... I don’t know, rollerblading? They’re similar modes of transportation but not the same thing. Today, she placed first in qualification for the parallel giant slalom knockout rounds that will take place later todaytonight.  South Korea’s Lee Sangho took the top spot in men’s qualification by a wide margin. If Canada scores a goal while all Americans who are still awake are watching Nathan Chen, did it really happen? Goal to Jamie Lee Rattray, assists to Natalie Spooner and Micah Zandee-Hart. But the US took revenge by ... whacking Canadian referee Cianna Lieffers in the face. Accidental, of course, but the high stick gets under the referee’s face mask, and bleeding ensues.  Then Canada and the referees get revenge by ... awarding a penalty shot after goalie Maddie Rooney stopped a shorthanded breakaway. Whatever. Marie-Philip Poulin scores, and Canadian Twitter reacts as if it’s the Miracle on Ice.  If you’re wondering why a Canada-USA game has three referees from Canada and two linespeople from the USA, well, join the club. Sure, it’s a relatively meaningless game, but isn’t this still the Olympics? This isn’t their exhibition tour any more, is it? Does no other country in the world have referees? (Yes, Canada, I see you just scored another goal. Give me a minute.) Chen got an unreal 21.21 score on his quad lutz-triple toeloop combination. He also had a quad flip worth 15.40. His component scores were all over 9.5 except “transitions,” which was 9.39. As he finished, he gritted his teeth to bring home the final spin and exulted when the music finished. The veteran scores from nearly the same spot as Cameranesi. The US defense gives away the puck in their own third. Sarah Nurse snares it and flips it over Brianne Jenner, who easily rips it straight ahead for the equalizer. He has done everything in figure skating except winning an inidual Olympic medal. He just took a giant step toward changing that with a short program that included a staggeringly difficult quad lutz-triple toeloop. We’ll get the score after noting another goal in hockey.The second period has been more event in terms of shots after the USA dominated play in the first, but the Americans are on the board thanks to Dani Cameranesi pouncing on her own rebound to blast it into the net from an acute angle. Assists to Kelly Panek and Cayla Barnes. The goal comes just as American Nathan Chen takes to the ice for his short program ...Total: 108.12. First for now.He nailed his quad toeloop-triple toeloop combination at the beginning of his routine but faded on his spins near the end. He’ll finish the short program in the top 10, well placed to improve upon his 12th-place finish in 2018. Australia is also represented musically here, with Canada’s Keegan Messing skating to a cover of the INXS classic Never Tear Us Apart. Norway’s Aleksander Aamodt Kilde has his first Olympic medal, a bronze, to go with his overall World Cup title in 2020 and possible super-G and downhill titles this season. But the man you’ll see on all the talk shows is Ryan Cochran-Siegle, the American journeyman who came out of nowhere to take silver 50 years after his mother won slalom gold -- also in Asia (Sapporo, Japan). Fellow Japanese skater Shoma Uno, the defending silver medalist, put a hand down on the ice but still posted a personal-best 105.46. The rest of the program was just that strong.A cross-check by the USA’s Caroline Harvey gives Canada a power play, and Brianne Jenner lofts a close-range shot into the top of the net. It’s all USA right now, with Abbey Murphy’s backhander hitting the post, hitting Canadian goalie Ann-Renee Desbiens’s back, then hitting the post again. One of the surest thing in the Winter Olympics is that these two teams will face off in the final. Due to idiosyncratic formatting, they also play in the round robin. An organist is playing the Rush classic The Spirit of Radio, which the Canadians should appreciate. One more of the top 30 to come. He’s Mila Hrobat of Slovenia, who has never come close to the top 10. And he won’t ...  Two of the top 30 are still to come. Canada’s Brodie Seger has never finished higher than 13th in a World Cup race but took an improbable fourth in last year’s world championship. Can he overachieve again?We can almost declare the podium complete. Coming into this race, we figured the only American interest would be Norway’s Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, who’s dating Mikaela Shiffrin and therefore could be awarded kind-of sort-of American status. He’s on the podium as expected. Austria’s Matthias Mayer is the defending champion, and he has racked up World Cup podium finishes this season. No surprise that he’s leading. The big story, as detailed in too many stats below, is Ryan Cochran-Siegle.  If you’re writing a Cinderella story, what’s the opposite of midnight? The clock is about to strike, and when it does, he stays at the ball forever. France’s Nils Allegre just won the award for “most entertaining run of the first 27 skiers,” which I just made up. He was all but splayed out across the snow but managed to regain his footing and take a wild path through the next two gates and finish on his feet. Bravo.The penultimate group is getting underway in the men’s short program. This is where the big-time skaters start.  Have to flip back to super-G. Here comes Jansrud, trying to turn back the clock in multiple ways ...The 29-year-old American has been no better than 11th in any world championship or Olympic competition.  He has never finished higher than 10th in any discipline in the World Cup season standings. He has two podium finishes in World Cup races, both in December 2020, when he finished second in a downhill and won a super-G. His best finish this season is fourth, though he does have a total of five top 10s. And he’s in position for Olympic silver.The intriguing name left on the start list is Norway’s Kjetil Jansrud. He won this event in 2014 and took bronze in 2018. He also has one super-G win this year. Twenty skiers have gone. He’s No. 24. Canada’s James Crawford has a good run going but makes a late mistake and loses a lot of time. Italy’s Christoph Innerhofer goes out of control and skids away. Next, two dangerous Austrians in Raphael Haaser and Max Franz. OK, never mind on Haaser. He got into the air on an early jump and landed on the wrong side of a gate.Sixteen skiers are done. If this holds through the next four skiers, the excitement may really take hold among that trio.Not quite, BUT he’s on the podium for now! What a huge run by the unheralded American! Still to come, though: downhill champion Beat Feuz and a couple of Austrians. Mayer is just 0.11 seconds behind at the first split time, but he drops to 0.24 back at the second. As he goes through the unique canyon section, he .. That may be your winner, and who knows how he did it?

A recent study led by Oxford academics, which found that up to a third of people found positive on a PCR test were not contagious, should give the Government cause to reconsider the wisdom of this approach.At an inidual level, knowing your own infection status can be extremely helpful, for example if you are planning to visit a vulnerable relative or friend. However, as we all know, a positive test result can have significant negative impacts, particularly if it entails loss of income and opportunity. If the tests are too sensitive, the problem is even worse.Furthermore, the truth is that we are permanently crawling with germs. Expecting the inidual to bear responsibility for any infection that he or she might pass on risks leaving us all living in a state of permanent guilt. Normally, this guilt is dispersed within the community.This is not to say that, during a pandemic, we should not exercise care to protect the vulnerable by limiting contact with them while we are infectious (in fact, I would highly recommend this) but it is also important to remember that once a disease has become endemic, there is little else we can do other than not visit granny when we have a fulminant cold.But to what extent should we self-isolate upon testing positive or being told that we may have been in contact with someone who tested positive? As we have witnessed over the past few months, these actions do little to stop the spread of infection and create enormous problems for the delivery of healthcare and education. Sanctioning the use of tests that suggest people are contagious even when they are not magnifies the problem.It is, however, important to recognise that things would not have been much different if we had a perfect test, as in some sense we now have with the new generation of LFDs. We would still have vast numbers of key workers unable to function and children being deprived of the safety and intellectual and emotional stimulation that our educational system seeks to provide. We would still have to endure life being endlessly disrupted – all having scant impact on the prevalence of an infection in its endemic state.Testing could have been profitably used at the population scale. Even imperfect measurements of the incidence of infection done randomly could have allowed us to make intelligent assessments regarding the progression of the pandemic and the effects of the restrictions, allowing greater flexibility and better tailoring advice to the vulnerable and the NHS.Some deficiencies in the rigour of testing early in the pandemic, given that we were dealing with an emergency, could be tolerated on the basis that it was important to garner information on the development of the situation. What cannot be forgiven is that, instead, we used a faulty testing scheme to transfer societal responsibilities to the inidual, sentencing many to loss of livelihood, education, social contact and hope – and we still are.Continuing with a mass testing, mass isolation strategy in response to a disease that has become endemic is merely piling up the misery.

It was very emotional to see my legs moving,” said the 30-year-old.“I’ve been through some pretty intense training in the past few months, and I’ve set myself a series of goals. For instance, I can now go up and down stairs, and I hope to be able to walk one kilometre by this spring.”Similar technology has been used to help patients with partial paralysis, but it is the first time it has been shown to work in people who had no movement at all.The implant was developed by scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital, and works by stimulating the region of the spinal cord that activates specific muscle groups in the trunk and legs.The team needs at least six centimetres (2.4 inches) of healthy spinal cord below the injury so that the implant can stimulate certain nerves. It is fitted underneath the vertebrae, inside the spinal column. They then use artificial intelligence to discover the sequence of neurons which fire in iniduals when they want to carry out various activities, such as walking, cycling and even canoeing.At the moment, the implant uses just 16 electrodes to stimulate the nerves, but in time, the researchers want to move to 32 or 64 to gain even greater control.After the implant, patients need about 10 days of recovery, before the implant can be switched on. As well as Mr Roccati, it has been also trialled successfully on three other patients.Prof Gregoire Courtine, a neuroscientist from EPFL, said: “Our stimulation algorithms are based on imitating nature, and work exactly in the way that the spinal cord is stimulated by the brain. “When you first turn it on you can stand, and step but you still need support, and the gait pattern is poor, but it allows you to start training all this activity immediately, and over the course of several months we can decrease the support.“All three patients were able to stand, walk, pedal, swim and control their torso movements in just one day, after their implants were activated. That’s thanks to the specific stimulation programs we wrote for each type of activity.“We are not yet at the stage where it’s a commercially available technology that you can use with your smartphone, but that’s our next objective.”For Mr Roccati’s first attempt, two small remote controls were attached to a walker to help him support himself because years of inactivity meant his muscles were severely wasted. The remote controls were attached wirelessly to a tablet which forwards the correct signals to a pacemaker in his abdomen. That pacemaker then relays the signals to the implant which stimulates specific neurons in a specific sequence, allowing the muscles to fire up in the correct order.Mr Roccati underwent surgery for the implant last August and has been steadily improving ever since.He said: “I had an accident on a motorbike and I immediately understood there was something wrong. I tried to move my legs and saw it was impossible. But I fixed in my mind that it was a problem to be solved.“I was living with my parents, and now I have an apartment and I can do everything alone no problem.”Dr Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital, added: “There are so many patients around the world who need a treatment to fight against paralysis.“This technology is so precise that immediately after the surgery, the patient can walk and stand. The electrodes are arranged in a way that corresponds exactly to the spinal nerve roots.“That gives us precise control over the neurons regulating specific muscles. Ultimately, it allows for greater selectivity and accuracy in controlling the motor sequences for a given activity.”While the progress achievable in a single day is groundbreaking, the gains after several months are even more impressive.The three patients were able to regain muscle mass, move around more independently, and take part in social activities like having a drink standing at a bar.The team is now working with Onward Medical, a medical technology company, to move the technology to a smartphone, so patients can simply select the activity they need.Larger clinical trials will be taking place in the US and Europe imminently, with the team hoping the device will be available within the next two to three years.Details of the research were published in the journal Nature Medicine.More from NewsOnce again, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz offers only evasions on RussiaPorn sites expected to ban children as Government strengthens online safety lawsObese to get \u0026#39game-changing\u0026#39 weight loss jabs on NHSCut 270 calories by sleeping for an extra hour every nightWhat the Blair-Brown years tell us about Downing Street todayMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"obese get weight loss jabs effective gastric band","story":"Weight loss jabs that are as effective as a gastric band are to start being prescribed by the NHS. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is expected to give the green light to Wegovy, a once-weekly injection which suppresses appetite. Trials have found those put on the treatment lost an average of almost 2.5 stone, compared with those given a placebo. Researchers last year said the treatment was a “game-changer”, with results comparable to those of weight loss surgery. One-third of those taking part in the trial lost an average of a fifth of their total body weight. The new recommendations are expected to recommend use of the treatment to those with a body mass index of 30 or over if they have been referred for specialist help, and to anyone with a  BMI of 35 or more with a weight-related health problem. More than one in four people in the UK are obese, which means a BMI of 30 or over. Experts said the treatment, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, should be taken alongside changes in dietary habits and exercise habits. The drug works by hijacking the body\u0027s own appetite regulating system in the brain, leading to reduced hunger and calorie intake. Research last year found that those put on the regime lost five times as much weight as those in the placebo group.When the results were published, Rachel Batterham, lead researcher for the project and professor of obesity, diabetes and endocrinology at University College London, said they were “a major breakthrough for improving the health of people with obesity”.“No other drug has come close to producing this level of weight loss - this really is a gamechanger,” she said. “For the first time, people can achieve through drugs what was only possible through weight-loss surgery.”Britain has some of the worst rates of obesity in the Western world, with two in three adults overweight or obese.Last week, NHS research found slimmers put on an NHS regime of soup and shakes to reverse diabetes have lost an average of two stone in just three months.More from NewsOnce again, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz offers only evasions on RussiaPorn sites expected to ban children as Government strengthens online safety lawsCut 270 calories by sleeping for an extra hour every nightWhat the Blair-Brown years tell us about Downing Street todayTuesday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"special advisors mustnt become special","story":"No, the problem is two-fold. The first is a fact that should be obvious in any organisation – no one can run anything if hisher right to lead is not respected. That includes the right to make the wrong decisions. Advisers, by definition, do not decide. If they cannot accept that basic rule, they should not be doing their jobs.The second is a democratic one. Governments are formed as a result of elections, and largely composed of people whom voters elected. If unelected advisers are trying to run the show, or plotting to depose elected people, they are showing contempt for the voters. They are undermining the legitimacy of the entire system.Mr Cummings’s great Vote Leave slogan was “Take back control”. If he had said “Give me control” instead, the public would never have voted Leave.Something very strange is therefore coming about. One of the main purposes of advisers – particularly in a Conservative government against which Whitehall is biased – is supposed to be to take on the so-called “Blob” of bureaucrats and quangos. The advisers are put in to help break the stranglehold of unelected power. But if they are simply a different unelected power, attempting to gain a stranglehold of their own, what good is that to voters?To coincide with her 70 years as monarch, the Queen has expressed this as her wish. Who can challenge her?Not for the first time, the Queen has picked the right moment. It reminds me of when, in 2018, she took advantage of the Commonwealth conference in London to persuade the assembled leaders that the Prince of Wales should be made Head of the Commonwealth on her death. They wanted to grant her wish.Most of them were not such extreme members of the Diana camp that they wanted the Prince of Wales passed over in favour of Prince William but many were very upset at the way they felt Diana had been treated. Mrs Parker Bowles became the target of their wrath. They did not want her to benefit, as they saw it, from the breakup and the tragedy of Diana’s death.It was because of feelings such as these that, when the couple did eventually marry in 2005, she became only the Duchess of Cornwall, not the Princess of Wales. But, as so often happens with marital break-ups, the sense of taking sides sharply reduces over time. If the new partner politely plays it long, shehe is accepted.Thanks to Camilla’s good sense and good will, that has clearly happened. She will never become – to use Diana’s own phrase about herself – our “Queen of Hearts” and has never for a moment sought such a vainglorious role.More from NewsOnce again, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz offers only evasions on RussiaPorn sites expected to ban children as Government strengthens online safety lawsObese to get \u0026#39game-changing\u0026#39 weight loss jabs on NHSCut 270 calories by sleeping for an extra hour every nightWhat the Blair-Brown years tell us about Downing Street todayTuesday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris rishi need good neighbours","story":"Neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours... but the Boris and Rishi fairytale is going to end in tearsDowning Street has found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, says Fleet Street Fox. But how long will Errorsboroughs marriage of convenience last Its the wedding of Rot and Brylcreem - a match made in hellopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsIf thereaposs one thing that Boris Johnson is disciplined about, itaposs control. Specically, not being subject to it. Wedding vows, lockdown rules, basic morality, the Ministerial Code, his own manesto: the default response of the Prime Minister to all of them is PAH! Which is why itaposs interesting that, a week after the worst week in his premiership since the previous worst week, which was only the week before, the PM is now submitting himself to the control of his Chancellor of the Exchequer.In a single weekend, Rishi Sunakaposs mates have moved into No, expensive policy announcements have been binned, and the crime of fraud which has taken £bn off the taxpayer on Covid alone has been downgraded to a harmless infraction of little consequence.  Unfortunately, this whirlwind romance is headed for some very big and pointy rocks.The first is that the cost of living crisis, which is already a crisis, is going to get worse with food costs predicted by millionaires to rise another % in April. No-one knows what to call something worse than a crisis, but the dictionary will probably need updating to include something like crisaster.The second is the energy crisis, in which the taxpayer has been forced to compensate corporate giants for not being able to steal money immediately, and instead letting them steal it over  years. Prices are likely to rise again in the autumn, and because  months was too long for billion-pound firms to wait, the government may allow an extra price rise in the summer to tide them over. Presumably, weaposll be calling this frobbery.If Boris thinks Her Upstairs is dficult to live with, heaposs going to flip when he finds out that Rishi is the sort of spouse whoaposll give him £ towards the housekeeping, and then ask for £ back by exerting some below-inflation fiscal drag on state pensions. On the face of it, their relationship is rooted in shared politics and a mutual love of money. But while one partner is a hedge funder whoaposs got more money than the Queen, the other never carries cash because he canapost hold onto it for more than  minutes.Both of them seem unable to spot a party when it involves  people, soft drinks, beer, renditions of Happy Birthday, a society wallpaperer, an official photographer, a strategically-sly cake, and a police investigation. Both, according to reports, are also capable of enjoying all that in the space of just  minutes before getting on with the job, which is a polite way of saying you burped all afternoon.But thereaposs little  these two have in common. One is a spender, the other a spaffer. One drinks beer, the other power. One is vain enough to arrange photocalls on staircases so he doesnapost look as short, while the other has just one suit and no comb. Read moreToday, weaposre told that a major announcement on Borisapos big promise to use the £bn National Insurance increase to bring down NHS waiting lists has been boiled down to a website, so that you can stop ringing the doctor to find out about your appointment and just throw the computer out of the window instead.Officially, the plan isnapost ready yet, and unofficially Rishiaposs blocking it until heaposs PM and can announce it himself. And therein lies the problem with this partnership: only last week, Johnsonaposs friends were telling him to kick Sunak out, on the grounds he was trying to steal his job.Imagine a bride trying to get the groom sacked, withholding cash while giving it to rich mates, giving Princess Diana eyes in TV interviews whenever sheaposs asked about parties. Picture a groom so desperate to keep the house that heaposll overlook their dferences, let her take total control, and start measuring up for curtains he will never get to see.Think about a relationship in that much trouble before its second anniversary. It might work in an Australian daytime soap, but it ainapost going to last in a world where people donapost come back from the dead after  years lost at sea. Johnson thinks heaposs saved his skin by ceding control to his most ambitious enemy, and boasts it would now take a Panzer ision to get him out of No. Sunak, meanwhile, is quietly lining up his tanks in the Downing Street garden, which he has always had a great view of from his No office. The PM is being infantilised by enemies saying his we wields all the power, and potentially criminalised by his friends claiming that she has nothing to do with his work, but nevertheless attended a lot of work events.And the only PR expert who can be persuaded to enter the fray is someone who considers the PM sexually incontinent, throws Benny Hill salutes at world leaders, quotes Gloria Gaynor, and on his first day gives the press the headline: Heaposs not a COMPLETE clown. But the fundamental flaw with this great reset, which is probably more of a breather to allow Rishi to liquidate assets, is that it involves trying to instil discipline in a man who has spent a letime shucking it. The fact he needs to be taught the self-control of a toddler is why he lives in Errorsborough - a town twinned with Débâcle.Fans may think these two have found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, but itaposll last only as long as it takes for Johnson to take back being out-of-control, and Sunak deciding that his tanks are ready to evict.

Speaking exclusively to the Mirror in Sunderland, he said: “They have seen we’ve changed. “People will either be very candid and say they felt the approach under the previous regime was that they just didn’t get business at all, or some will say they understood maybe where the motivations were coming from - they understood there’s not enough high-quality work in the UK, too much low-wage, low-skill work - but they just didn’t feel we were realistic in how we thought we could achieve that.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter  “You’ve got to do that with a partnership with business. There’s no magic and to wave, it’s that framework you put in place. “It’s maybe not realistic to say you will put up taxes on businesses to such a high degree and then expect them to do the investment you want.”Industry chiefs could also be looking to Labour because of Boris Johnson ’s infamous “f*** business” rant, and as his Chancellor Rishi Sunak lts corporation tax from % to % - piling pressure on firms battling soaring energy prices, a national insurance hike and minimum wage rises. Business leaders were also spooked by the Prime Minister’s speech to the Confederation of British Industry last year, where he told guests about a recent day trip to Peppa Pig World.“People see Labour have changed, but so have the Tories,” said Mr Reynolds. “They like the change they have seen in us and they don’t like what they have seen in the Government.” He said business chiefs were put off by the PM’s “cavalier attitude” and “flippancy”. “This is a crucial time for business,” he said.  “There is this coming together this year with the national insurance tax rise, the energy price hike and inflation … it’s reasonable that they have a serious response from the PM - and they haven’t had that.” Admitting Labour had a responsibility to offer an alternative, he added: “People use our vision on the economy and relationship with business as a proxy of whether they see us as a viable government, on the whole.”Mr Reynolds, who was elected MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, Greater Manchester, in  and won a , majority at the  election, is working with party leader Keir Starmer, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Shadow Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband and Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden to develop an industrial strategy, which Labour hopes to unveil before its September conference.The blueprint will “be a basis for a conversation with businesses, unions and other stakeholders”, said Mr Reynolds, who wants to “re-industrialise” Britain.  He believes hailing from the North East gives him an insight into some of the biggest issues businesses face. “I know from growing up here - Labour politicians often go on about the past too much - but clearly the Miners’ Strike and the shipyard closures, no-one would say this was the strongest economy to grow up in,” he said. “If you want to do this job really well, whether you’re from a place like this, you have to understand the places like Sunderland and Tameside, where I have grown up and now have lived in my adult le, because you have to understand the story of the Industrial Revolution and how it shapes this country - particularly the Midlands and the North but then the challenges that come from the deindustrialisation of the s onwards.“That conversation has led to ‘leveling-up’ and Brexit and, for the first time, some of those places trying out the Conservative Party.“It couldn’t get more real as a background.  If Mr Reynolds succeeds in taking over at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, he could face an economy battered by a cost-of-living crisis, struggling to find the “unicorn” of greater productivity and dealing with the highest interest rates since before the  financial meltdown. He hopes to hear from successful firms what they want from ministers. Donning a cap and hi-vis, he toured the Nissan factory this week, seeing production lines for the Qashaqi, Juke and Leaf models. Like other UK carmakers, Nissan produced fewer cars last year than during the first year of the pandemic . Figures last week showed that in , Britainaposs car assembly plants produced just , vehicles - % down on the , made in . UK factories are producing a third fewer cars than in . Output at Nissan in Sunderland, which was producing more than half a million a year, plummeted to just ,. But the factory, which employs , workers, is a leading example that Labour wants others to follow.  “The Nissan factory in Sunderland is one of the country’s - one of the world’s - most productive and efficient and world-class places,” Mr Reynolds said. “So why when we have got something as good as that, when we can do things as well as that, are we a place where our growth since the financial crisis for the last decade has been really poor, and is forecast to be poor again after we have the immediate bounce back from the pandemic  “Why are we a place where productivity is the worst it’s been for  years  “How can we, as a prospective Labour Government, learn from places like that and have the policies in place that will make sure we can offer genuinely better jobs, a better future and better growth and prosperity ” New role is demanding Since switching from Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary to the Shadow Business role in November, Jonathan Reynolds has spent more time away from home. Juggling his new job with being a dad to four children - Jack, , Bessie, , Arthur, eight, and Seth, six - is tricky. It’s demanding. Obviously I was delighted to be asked to be in the Shadow Cabinet when Keirwas elected leader,” he said.  “Work and Pensions is a challenging job -a quarter of the whole government budget. “But this is an even more demanding role because the issues we are talking about are central to the country’s success.” He admitted that balancing work and family le “can be challenging”, but added: “My we Claire is incredibly supportive - the whole family are. “The whole family have to be supportive of you to be a politician, certainly at the leading edge. It helps that he knows how to keep his children amused.  “The kids particularly liked my joke on Question Time thatBoris Johnson told me it was raining I would go outside and check,” he quipped. Returning to his roots gave him time to reflect. “It’s fun coming back home to Sunderland today. Being around the city centre and being here, you remember a lot about how you thought about things growing up,” he said. “Being at Nissan is obviously quite a novelty, that you’ve got somebody who went to the comprehensive school down the road coming back as the Shadow Business Secretary.” Mr Reynolds was just  when Jack, who is autistic, was born. “Having Jack at a young age, in terms of just who you are - maturity - it was a really big deal, and Jack having autism and the challenges around that are a really formative experience,” he said. “It was not easy at times but all of that contributes to who you are.” Footballaposs coming home Eyes lighting up as he enters Sunderland AFC’s boardroom, Jonathan Reynolds beams: “I’ve never been in here before, it’s just immense!” The local boy who now sits in the Shadow Cabinet is an avid Black Cats fan, attending a handful of home games each season and following the side away. The Stalybridge and Hyde MP’s last match was the - defeat at Portsmouth in October.  “We got hammered,” he admitted. Mr Reynolds hails from  miles away in Houghton-le-Spring and has supported the team since he was a boy. “My dad’s a Sunderland fan, my granddad was a Sunderland fan, my children are Sunderland fans - despite the fact Stalybridge is fairly close to Man City and a slightly better offer,” he said. His parents even bought him a £ brick in the ,-seater Stadium of Light as it was being built in the mid-s. Now, he is here to host a roundtable discussion with the North East Chamber of Commerce, just a few yards from the hallowed turf. Speaking at the ground after a pilgrimage to admire the mural to club legend Raich Carter, who played  games for the side in the s and captained them to FA Cup and League Championship triumphs, Mr Reynolds said: “People all around the country are passionate about where they come from and care about their football teams.“This really is an expression of identity here in Sunderland.”  He added: “The relationship between working people and football in this country is really strong. “Despite the fact it hasn’t been a particularly easy - I was going to say ‘decades’ - for Sunderland, to come back here is absolutely wonderful. The once mighty club lie third in League One - comfortably among the play off spots, though they have won just one of their past five matches. Brexit is settled  In the run-up to the  Brexit referendum, Nissan’s chairman Carlos Ghosn said that while EU membership was a decision for voters, the company believed a Remain result “makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs”. Sunderland promptly voted .% to Leave - one of the highest Out majorities in the UK. After campaigning to stay and then promising a second referendum, Labour’s settled position is now to “make Brexit work”. Speaking after touring the Nissan plant, Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “There’s no way you can say there aren’t challenges that come from Brexit - the whole premise of Nissan’s investment in the s, which has grown in scale overtime, they were looking for a berth in the single market.  “Eighty-per-cent of the vehicles they make there are for export, so anything which is increasing bureaucracy, barriers to trade with the single market, it’s a challenge. “But the fact is it has happened. I think there are certainly things that can be done better, but they have got to be trade solutions.“This constitutional argument about structures and being in the European Union, that’s settled. “For Labour it’s about what are the practical things that can be done to reduce those barriers “Clearly that is one of the drag factors on growth at the minute.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jonathan Reynolds MPJonathan ReynoldsLabour PartyPoliticsNissanNissan Motor Company, Ltd.\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It has been announced that Kate will be reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story on Sunday to mark Childrenaposs Mental Health Week, as well as the channelaposs th birthday.A sneak peek photo shows Kate sitting crossed-legged looking casual in jeans and a comfy jumper sitting by a fire as she prepares to read The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark by Jill Tomlinson.The book follows the story of Plop, a baby barn owl, who is helped by others to grow in confidence and overcome his fears - and the story aligns with this years’ theme of the week which is growing together. CBeebies Bedtime Stories airs every night at .pm as the final part of the channelaposs hour-long bedtime segment. But rather than have unknown presenters, stars such as Dolly Parton, Tom Hardy and Bridgertonaposs Rege-Jean Page have all rocked up to lull little ones to sleep sleep recently.Patricia Hidalgo, director of BBC Children’s and Education said: “I couldn’t be more proud to have the Duchess read a CBeebies Bedtime Story as we mark the th anniversary of our CBeebies and CBBC channels.

It’s such a special and relevant tale and perfectly represents this yearaposs Children’s Mental Health week theme.I can’t wait to see her deliver her own take on such a classic story and I’m sure our audience can’t either.” Kate has been heavily involved in championing childrenaposs mental health and has taken a keen interest in early years development. Just last week, it was announced she would be carrying out a fact-finding mission to Denmark as part of her Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood.  Kensington Palace revealed that she will be flying solo when she travels to the capital Copenhagen for a two-day visit on February  and  without husband Prince William. It is the first time that Kate will bring the centreaposs work to the international stage and on the trip and she hopes to learn from Denmarkaposs example as a country widely recognised as a world leader in its approach and investment in early childhood development. In a personal tweet, the duchess said: “Looking forward to learning from experts, parents  practitioners about Denmark’s approach to early childhood later this month. “Denmark is a beacon of best practice in its approach to the early years, with a culture which prioritises the best start in le.” She ended the message with the Danish words “Pa snarligt gensyn”, which translate as “See you soon”, and the letter “C” to denote a personal tweet.

Mohammed Reza Zolati was visiting Longtimber Woods in Ivybridge, Devon, on June   with his two stepchildren when the tragedy happened.An inquest at Plymouth Coroneraposs Court today heard how the young girl managed to get herself out of the water before calling  for help, Devon Live reports.The girl escaped without serious injury but Reza ended up struggling in the water.His stepson stopped a woman for help and other good samaritans attempted to pull Reza out from the popular deep body of water off the River Erme.In a statement, the woman recalled how she and her friend were stopped by the boy while walking their dogs through the woods alongside the river.  The boy then told them his stepfather had been in an accident and led her down a rocky slope to the river. The inquest heard she saw the shape of a body floating under the water so jumped into the water to rescue him while her friend took over the  call from the stepdaughter. She told how she was not a strong swimmer but tried to e down into the water to reach him but was unable to, and said she kept getting swept away. The passerby said: “It was awful.” Even with the help of her friend they were still unable to. Another passerby joined in the effort and it was only when he was assisted by another man that there were able to pull his body onto the rocks and begin CPR. However, Reza was unable to be revived and was confirmed dead at .pm. The initial passerby said: “What happened was tragic but I believe everyone who helped was brilliant. “The little boy and girl deserve some credit as they were so calm and deserve praise too.” The inquest heard the passerby had managed to keep the children and also members of the public away from the scene. Reza, who was born in Iran and was a mechanic before moving to the UK, had been in the water for around  minutes before being rescued and was unable to be revived. A post mortem confirmed the cause of his death was drowning. His GP described Reza as being a ‘fit and well’ man. A police investigation confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances or third party involvement. Detective constable Rachel Walke said: “It appears from all our enquiries it was a tragic accident.” She added that on arrival at the scene, police were initially concerned for the welfare of the children who could not be seen but they were them confirmed as being safe and well at their nearby home. DC Walke confirmed that the pool was a popular area for swimming and that it was deceptively deep and was ‘very dficultapos to get out of once in the water. She added no rescue aids were available at the location. Coroner Ian Arrow, who recorded a conclusion of accidental death, asked the officer to find out who owned the land and that he would then review whether it was appropriate to write to them to review the lack of rescue aids. Following Rezaaposs death, a fundraiser was launched praising his heroic efforts and to raise funds to have his body flown back to his home country and for a memorial service in Devon. The fundraising page said: On Tuesday, June  , Rezaaposs stepdaughter got into some dficulty in the River Erme, located in Long Timber Woods, Ivybridge. Being the hero Reza was, he jumped in and saved her, but unfortunately was unable to save himself as he was a non-swimmer. This goes to show how selfless Reza was, and he showed this every day. He leaves behind his girlfriend and -month-old little girl, as well as lots of friends and colleagues who all saw him as family. We are trying to raise funds so Reza can be flown to his home country, to be laid to rest in peace with the presence of the rest of his family. We are also wanting to hold a memorial service for Reza here in Ivybridge so all who knew him can show their love and respect for him. The gofundme page states that the fundraiser was halted after being reported as aposfraudulentapos and was put under review.

The dismembered bodies were found with their skulls between their legs and were among  bodies.The team of around  archaeologists made the discovery during an excavation being carried out at Fleet Marston, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire,The Express reported.One possible explanation for the unusual find is that the decapitated skeletons may have belonged to criminals or outcasts. However, the bones will need to undergo proper analysis before a full conclusion can be reached. This will be completed by the researchers who will be hoping to discover new insights about Roman civilization. It is understood that although decapitation may be a horric act in modern times, the Romans saw it as a normal, albeit marginal, burial rite in the late Roman period. More than , coins and several lead weights were also found on-site, which could suggest that the excavated area was once a thriving location for trade and commerce. And a hoard of domestic objects including spoons, pins and brooches were also uncovered.  Gaming dice and bells were also found which could mean that the Romans gambled here and took part in religious activities. Helen Wass, head of heritage at HS Ltd said: “The HS archaeology programme has enabled us to learn more about our rich history in Britain. “The large Roman cemetery at Fleet Marston will enable us to gain a detailed insight into the residents of Fleet Marston and the wider Roman Britain landscape. All human remains uncovered will be treated with dignity, care, and respect and our discoveries will be shared with the community.” Richard Brown, Senior Project Manager for COPA, said: “The excavation is signicant in both enabling a clear characterization of this Roman town but also a study of many of its inhabitants.” This excavation took more than a year and was done by a team from Cotswold Archaeology and Oxford Archaeology . They were working on behalf of an HS contractor. And this is not the only shocking find that archaeologists have made along the HS line. In fact, Fleet Marston is just one out of over  archaeological sites that have been excavated since .

The mum longs to walk down the aisle at her wedding but was forced to put plans for her big day on hold. Now she is seeking to raise £k for brain surgery so she can be given back her le, after a horrying few years.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereThe mum lives in Ashford, Kent with her science teacher fiancé Robin McNicoll, , and her four children Luis, , Sidney, , Travis, , and Astraea, nine,Fearing she could die at any minute, Louise feels her only hope is surgery available in Spain and is now desperately trying to fund it, saying: I try not to think about what could happen because itaposs terrying. When we first got engaged in April , it was the happiest day of my le. We were at an oak tree with a swing, Robin asked to take a photo of me and he asked me how much I loved him. I didn’t know how to respond and he askedit was enough to marry him. I was euphoric. It was the best feeling.  It was so romantic. Back then we could have never imagined anything like this happening. I want to be able to enjoy my wedding. I don’t want to be screaming and shouting in pain on what should be the best day of my le. I used to always dance with my children, but I havenapost been able to in two years and I desperately want to dance with them again on my wedding day, too. But we are having to come to terms with the fact we might not have that special day for a very long time, as all our money is going towards surgery.Louiseaposs problems started after a minor car accident in December  triggered more than two years of constant and agonising headaches and relentless pain all over her body. She said: Over the next few weeks, I started to have headaches and neck pains, but I assumed it was whiplash. Sadly, that was the start of a living nightmare for Louise, who had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a long-term condition causing pain all over the body, in February , after struggling to cope with stfness and pain. Before that growing up, she had always dislocated knees easily and suffered from random aches and pains, but had not thought much of it. She added: I dislocated my knee a few times, but I just assumed that was normal. I was told I was double-jointed. I had random pains that were unexplained when I was younger and Iaposve always had migraines, but I didnapost worry about them. Despite sometimes feeling like she was walking through cement because of muscle stfness, she put a brave face on things and even enjoyed a trip to Paris later that summer. But the car crash changed everything for Louise. And, in January , she started to experience tremors and what she describes as stroke-like symptoms, such as slurred speech. Since then, she has seen numerous specialists, who have given her a iety of dferent diagnoses. At one point, it was suspected she had multiple sclerosis- a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord. At others, medics have thought she had everything from severe headaches and migraines to possible Chiari malformation, where the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal. In the meantime, Louise says her symptoms have run riot, as she has experienced everything from slurred speech to agonising headaches and a suspected stroke, which led to numerous investigations, including MRI scans. Feeling increasingly isolated and depressed, for months she was in and out of AE with a host of related problems until desperate for help, in January  she saw an otologist - a specialist in ear diseases - who suggested she joined Facebook groups for people with similar symptoms for support.This was her eureka moment as, through members of a Facebook support group, she was told about a leading expert in her type of symptoms, at the Neuroinstitut in Barcelona, Spain. After examining her MRI and other scans and speaking to her, in April  he diagnosed craniocervical instability - meaning there is excessive movement between her skull and across most of the cervical vertebrae. He recommended spinal fusion surgery, which uses donor bone to strengthen the spine, and skull base decompression surgery - an operation that involves removing a small section of bone from the base of the skull. She also had a private consultation in this country, where she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome- a genetic form of hypermobility. Deciding to stick with these diagnoses, Louiseaposs obstacle now is finding the funding to go to Spain, so she can be treated by the surgeon she has so much faith in. Sadly, with two private operations, airfares and accommodation to pay for while she recovers, she needs £k for surgery and another £k for the additional costs. So, she has launched a GoFundMe page, appealing to kind strangers to help her fund the medical care that she is positive will save her le and eventually see her enjoying the first dance at her wedding. She said: Having the surgery would mean we’d get our lives back, so I can be there for my children and my fiancé. With everything we’ve gone through, it’s taken a massive toll on me, but also on my family, who have become my carers. We just want to go back to a normal le. It would be priceless. It would give us a second chance at le. We could have our dream wedding, which has been put on hold. I want to be a good mum again. I want to be there for my children.

Despite a brief split in , the Duke of Cambridge proposed during a trip to Kenya and Kate said aposI doapos in April . But according to a royal expert, Kate started making subtle changes to her appearance before the engagement in .

I think that did come about because William and Kate were coming towards the point where they would announce their engagement. It was Kate starting to behave in ways which would be seen more appropriate for a future Queen.The couple made their first public appearance together at their university graduation from St Andrewaposs, which was attended by the Queen, Prince Charles and Carole and Michael Middleton.  Royal expert Victoria Arbiter adds: Graduation for William and Kate, it really was their last moment in that protective bubble. I think perhaps they might have both been a bit naive about what was to come. William understood how the media works but Kate would have had no idea what it meant to be on the receiving end. All eyes were on the prince, with an engagement announcement expected at any moment, however, it wasnapost until Kate made a surprise appearance at Williamaposs graduation with her parents that experts were  per cent sure she was aposThe One.aposBut it appeared William had reservations about his future with Kate.While many predicted that William would propose soon after the pair graduated in , it didnapost happen.And it wasnapost until many years later that William asked Kate to be his we, with his dad Prince Charles famously joking: They have been practising long enough.

But the car salesman was left stunned when his boss called to tell him to switch off his phone because the bill seems a little high. John said he nearly fainted when BT told him how much the GB of data heaposd used would cost. He told told The Sun : “My boss called and said you’re going to have to switch off the phone. The bill seems a little high.“I said ‘What is it ’ He said £,. Next day he phoned back and said, ‘Definitely switch it off, it’s now £,’.” Johnaposs boss Paul Trotter, , of AAA Performance in Rainford Merseyside, said he nearly fell off my chair when BT shared the bill. He added: It’s obviously a computer error. I’ve had a look at the bill and it shoots up £ every  seconds or so. That’s just not possible.“EvenJohn was downloading Hollywood blockbusters there’s no way he’d have gone that much over.” Because John is on a business contract, which includes just MB of data, no warning was given when he exceeded the limit. Paul added: “I was worried at first but I’m confident BT will realise it’s just an error. “John had a great holiday so there’s no harm done and we’ve even managed to laugh about it.” A spokesman for BT said they will erase the huge bill after Johnaposs story was made public. He said: “We understand this is a very signicant bill to receive, so, on this occasion, we are waiving the surplus roaming charges. “In this case, the customer was on a BT Business mobile plan which included a monthly data allowance of MB. When travelling in Turkey he far exceeded his agreed limit by consuming GB of data. We alerted him several times that he had exceeded his data allowances, that standard roaming charges were in place and that he was incurring high usage. Our records show that the customer chose not to include a data cap as part of his plan. “We always recommend customers opt for a roaming cap, as the vast majority of our business customers do. We also urge customers to pay attention to any notications we send them around their data allowance.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsPhone bill\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The stretch of road in the village of Melbury Abbas, in north Dorset, is scheduled to be closed for five nights, to allow broadband fibre optic cables to be laid.But drivers are being threatened with a £, finethey attempt to use the closed-off road. People who need to travel between Melbury Abbas and Shaftesbury, just three miles north of the village, will have to drive  miles south before joining the A and going back on themselves. The ersionary loop will amount to a distance of around  miles in total and residents have said it will cause signicant delays to their journeys. The only other alternatives are along the tight bends and country lanes which are impossible for larger vehicles to navigate.  Jenny Weston, a local resident, said it would cause traffic chaos surrounding Melbury Abbas as motorists try to avoid the road closure. She said: This will probably cause chaos on the lanes and take longer to get to the destination in the process. One local resident said: Are locals really going to use this -mile ersion  It seems daft to have to drive so far to get to somewhere that is less than a mile away. Others have claimed it would be impossible for lorries to navigate the tight bends along aposZig Zag Hillapos, which is the only other route aside from the -mile ersion along the A.  Melbury Abbas has previously been dubbed the aposVillage of the Jammedapos as HGVs regularly get stuck along the narrow roads with an average of  jams a week. Alan Perry said: There is no way a lorry with a trailer will be able to navigate around the tight bends on Zig Zag Hill. Shirley Ball added: Letaposs hope no articulated lorries try the Zig Zag option. A local resident said: This will mean a great deal of traffic along Zig Zag hill and the A. Itaposs going to have very big implications. One man, who wished not to be named, said his daughter kept sheep on the section of road which will be closed. He said it will be impossible for her to reach them by car in the next five days. How is she going to get to them ” he asked. A spokesman for the local Dorset Council said: Any person who uses or permits the use of a vehicle in contravention of the notice will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £. “This is based on standard council policy.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

Sources have confirmed to The Mirror that the Prince of Wales spoke to both of his sons in the weeks leading up to the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee anniversary, prior to the monarch’s bombshell announcement on Saturday. In the surprising announcement, Queen Elizabeth II declared it was her “sincere wish” that Camilla take on the title of Queen Consort.The move was hailed as an “extraordinary” gesture by royal watchers.She broke the news in an address to mark the anniversary of her taking the throne  years ago on February . For years insiders were sure Camilla would take the title Princess Consort when Prince Charles became King. But conventional wisdom was brushed aside in the bombshell pm statement from the Palace, announcing the monarch’s wish that Camilla be known as Queen Consort.  The conversation between the Duke of Sussex and his father come after concerns of a rt between the pair, following Harry’s departure from le as a senior working royal.A royal expert last year suggested Prince Charles was hit hard by Prince Harryaposs decision to quit the Royal Family and move to the US. Royal journalist and author Robert Jobson said: I think that he [Charles] was closer to Harry and that’s why it’s hit him quite hard with what’s happened with Harry.The comments came amid claims Harry had broken the ice and taken small steps in healing his rt with Charles and brother Prince William at Prince Philipaposs funeral.Harry is said to have talked briefly with Charles, but issues between the two were thought to have remained unresolved. However, last month it was revealed that Prince Charles has offered an olive branch to Harry by inviting his family to stay with him when they next visit the UK. Royal sources confirmed the Prince of Wales has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren, having not seen Archie since he was six months old and not ever meeting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby daughter, Lilibet Diana, who was born in June.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and his we Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood.But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. It was thought that Harry and Meghan would certainly make an effort to attend events to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in June.Harry is understood to have told family members he would attend a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey, which is planned for April.However, it has emerged that the Duke of Sussex claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the Royal Family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Royal sources have confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. “This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with himthey wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time. “In the meantime, there has been a series of good-natured and enjoyable calls between them all which is something the prince very much look forward to.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Charles, Prince of WalesPrince WilliamHome Officepolitan PoliceRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the Prince of Wales has no doubts that he will be based at the central London palace with the Cambridges possibly living at Windsor Castle, it has been reported.Charles currently lives with his we Camilla at Clarence House, the former residence of the Queen Mother.A source said that Charles is convinced that Buckingham Palace is symbolically the home of the monarch and that he should be based there when king. They told the Daily Mail : “There is no question about it. HRH’s view is that you need a monarch at monarchy HQ. This has never been in doubt.”As well a residence for the monarch, Buckingham Palace is a working operation with more than  million tourists visiting each year and it receives almost , guests. The source continued: The Prince of Wales will not move into Buckingham Palace before he is king. But when he is, he absolutely will. Just like the Queen, it will effectively be in the aposflat above the shopapos. He feels it is right, just as the Queen does, to work out of Buckingham Palace. The Palace will still be a working and entertaining hub and will also still be open to visitors. It is a hugely important tourist attraction. But the prince can still live there at the same time, much like he does at Highgrove, which is also open to the public.  A major refurbishment has been taking place at a cost of £ million for the taxpayer where electrics and plumbing have been improved as part of a general overhaul. The royals have moved out of the building while the work is underway and is due to be completed in . The Cambridgesapos London base is currently Kensington Palace while they also have Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, given to them by the Queen.

In a statement marking her th year on the throne yesterday, the monarch revealed she wants Camilla to take on the title of Queen Consort when Charles becomes King. The move was dubbed extraordinary by some experts, who thought she would follow the trend with the title of Princess Consort.But this is not the first time Her Majesty gave her permission for the duchess to take the role, according to one senior royal source.The source claims the Queen gave her blessing five years ago for Charles to call his we Queen Camila at his coronation.  After the Queenaposs announcement over the weekend, it was also reported that Camilla will receive the Queen Motheraposs priceless  crown when she ascends to the position. The crown famously features the -carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, which originated in India, in a platinum mount. The blessings piled on Camila this week are a world away from the complex relationship between her and the Queen in earlier years. Once referring to her as that wicked woman, Her Majesty disliked Camilla for what she saw as meddling in Prince Charlesaposs marriage with the late Princess Diana. But in recent years, the Queenaposs contempt cooled and insiders say she has been actively preparing the Duchess for her new role. Speaking of Charlesaposs plan to call his we Queen Camilla, the source explained: ‘This is something that has been on the Prince of Wales’ mind for some time, but the timing had to be right.There was a nervousness, they wanted to get it right. ‘It’s been a done deal for some time, but the question has been how best to execute it. You are not going to please everyone.apos  Another senior royal source reportedly said the Queen felt Camilla ‘deserved’ to get the proper title that ‘comes with the job’. They said the Duchess has never tried to aposovershadowapos and always played a apossupportive roleapos but she has also aposcarved a role out for herselfapos. Other changes to the coronation plans have also been made, with officials reportedly shortening it from usual three-hour long event to ‘better reflect the times’ and it will be more reflective of religious, cultural and ethnic ersities.  After the Queenaposs historic announcement this weekend, Charles issued his own statement stating his sheer gratitude to his mother for her support, adding: aposWe are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother’s wish.apos He also paid tribute to the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee this year, by saying her ‘devotion to the welfare of all her people inspires still greater admiration with each passing year’.

As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth. I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family. I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign.

She has claimed she wants to stand out from the other women at a detention camp who are still supporting the terrorist organisation, by changing her look.Ms Begum, who has been living in Al-Roj Camp in northeast since her UK citizenship was stripped in , has spoken to ITV News as part of a new podcast series, presented by Global Security Editor Rohit Kachroo. Shamima Begum: The Blame Game podcast looks at whether the authorities made errors that enabled the -year-old to travel to Syria with two other East London schoolgirls when she was just .She has made messages which have been smuggled out of the camp and sent to a filmmaker. In them she makes clear her despair at being left aposstatelessapos and describes how she has tried to recover from the trauma of losing three babies.  She said: “I’ve moved on from that part of my le, it doesn’t make me feel sad anymore. The podcast also hears from Richard Walton, the former head of Scotland Yardaposs counter-terror command, who led the police investigation into Ms Begumaposs disappearance. In his first interview about the case since leaving his post, he rejects allegations that police failures allowed the three young girls to make it to Syria. Mr Walton claims he led “a textbook investigation” and says faster action by the politan Police could not have stopped the schoolgirls from making it into ISIS-controlled territory.  He claims the girls’ journey to Syria was exploited by extremist organisations for their own purposes, to try and put the blame for this matter on the police. He added: It was not the police that decided to go to Syria. Hundreds of British citizens, including Ms Begum, were stripped of their citizenship by the British government. The podcast, which is out now, also hears from the former head of the United Nations special investigation into ISIS crimes, Karim Kham QC.  He calls for former ISIS members to be put on trial, like those at Nuremberg for Nazi leaders after World War Two. He said: The concern is not where. I really don’t care where the trials take place so long as a fair trial is possible. It’s obvious that it’s absolutely unacceptable and it’s not tenable to have iniduals in aposNo manaposs landapos.There’s no sieving between those iniduals that may be hardened Daesh members who are criminally responsible… and those that may be caught up in the conflict, be they battered wives or abused children.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ISISShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Burglars are checking whether residents are on holiday by pouring kidney beans over doorsteps at night, a home security expert has revealed. Elizabeth Johns explained that robbers use the ploy to seethe beans are cleaned up by residents in the morning - which indicatestheir hunch is right or wrong. If the kidney beans remain untouched, burglars can see the house as a potential target to break into. People are now being warned to look out for the bizarre mark left on neighbouring doorsteps and clean them up where possible.It seems ridiculous, but we heard a while back that people are putting kidney beans on the front of peopleaposs doors, Ms Johns told The Sun. Obviously,youaposre in youaposd clean them up, butyouaposre away thenthe tin of kidney beans was still there then that suggests that youaposre away. Ms Johns said the tactic was being used in the Manchester area to establishanybody is in the house because that makes it a much more desirable target. She also suggested that homeowners could ask a nearby family member or trusted neighbour to keep an eye on their house when they are away. Other methods previously reported to be used by burglars include leaving a strip of sellotape over the front door keyhole. Thieves or squatters can come to the likely conclusion that its occupants are awaythe tape is still there one or several days later. Stickers on wheelie bins and stones stacked up near doorways are other signs that could suggest burglars are targeting your home. In addition to these secret signs, residents should ensure side and back gates are secure and sheds, garages and outbuildings are locked, according to advice from Crimestoppers. It also warns not to leave garden tools or ladders outside, to fit tamper-proof automatic outside security lights and try not to leave accessible windows open at night, even when at home.

The MOL Treasure shipping container, which measures  metres in , has arrived at the DP World Container Terminal at the Port of Southampton, bringing goods from China into the UK.The vessel docked off the coast of England after leaving Yantian on January  this year, the Express reports.According to the latest data, at the container ship port in Southampton, there are currently , container imports being handled. At the same time, there are , containers being exported.  Shipping delays at the end of last year saw concerns that food and toys could run out over Christmas, and experts have warned delays will continue through this year. Giant containers like this one are resupplying a supply chain in the Uk that has been left depleted. The lorry driver shortage has contributed to disruption at UK ports. In December Tim Morris, chief executive officer of the UK Major Ports Group, said that trade ports had become “the jam in the sandwich between surging, volatile shipping and UK supply chains badly impacted by factors such as HGV driver shortages”.  He said: “Ports have taken signicant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience. “They have extended gate opening to  , increased capacity for trucks at peak hours, sought to maximise rail freight usage within the signicant constraints of the network, created additional storage space and recruited more people. “But the pressures are being exacerbated by well-publicised issues impacting all UK supply chains, notably shortages of HGV drivers. “Ports therefore have to manage access to storage space very dynamically in extreme situations. This can mean some very limited short-term restrictions. “Ports are committed to working closely with customers and entire supply chains to keep goods moving.”Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON YantianCity of Southampton Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Cambridge University researchers tested seven dferent ways to improve the effectiveness of face masks when it comes to protecting against the virus.The DIY methods included taping the mask to your face to secure it properly, which was effective but uncomfortable or using rubber bands. Other hacks included filling the gaps with bandages or tying the strings for a tighter fit. But the method which showed the most promising results was to wear tights across the bottom half of your face and over your face mask. Face coverings have been criticised for not fitting tightly enough in order to signicantly reduce the viral particles that a person breathes in or out.  But the researchers said this bizarre new hack could close the gaps around the nose and mouth and lower the amount by up to seven times more than a loose face mask. They also noted, however, that it was unlikely to be tolerated for extended periods of time given the physical and social implications of wearing pantyhose on your face in public.The study looked at data from four volunteers who tried the seven dferent methods using both surgical and KN masks, reports MailOnline.While wearing the masks, each of the volunteers did seven minutes of exercises designed to mimic real-le activities such as talking, smiling, bending over, turning their head to the side, nodding and breathing.  The scientists gave them a fit factor score based on how well the masks fit according to the filtration efficiency. They found that better fitting masks have fewer gaps between the edge and the personaposs face, meaning that the air is filtered through the mask. The most effective way of improving the fit of KN masks was using tights and cloth tape which boosted the fit factor by . and . respectively, the findings show. Using gauze to fill the gaps between the face and the KN masks only offered a slight improvement of . while using it on top of the masks only boosted the fit by .. Surgical masks worked betterworn with tights, with a score of ., orthe gaps were sealed with cloth tape, scoring ..  The least effective way of improving their fit was by using rubber bands and tying ear bands with a score of .. But the attempt was still better than wearing a mask alone. Despite the positive benefits and the accessibility of the hacks, the team noted that they were uncomfortable overall. Tights gave the volunteers high levels of discomfort and caused problems with speaking while rubber bands put pressure on the ears and face, they found. Fabric tape was comfortable to wear but not to remove and it could be dislodged over time due to sweat or moving. The researchers said that the results could help designers improve masks and fitting devices.Most scientists agree that wearing a face mask makes a limited contribution to curbing the spread of coronavirus among the wider population.Medical grade masks can be far more resistant than common surgical or cloth masks but they can also be uncomfortable and hard to get hold of.

It was launched last October and has proved so popular orders are already being taken for next year.Makers Jetson, a Swedish-Polish firm, said riders will feel like James Bond when they take to the skies.It adds this is just the beginning – with flying cars this decade. Peter Ternstrom, one half of the brains behind the Jetson One, said: “The first time I flew it, it felt amazing, it’s vibration free so nothing like a helicopter or aeroplane.  “But we have a vision way beyond the Jetson One. By the end of the decade, we want a four-seater flying car on the market, one that can replace a normal family car. “We want to make cities a better place to live and mass transport is going to need to change.” Peter and co-founder Tomasz Patan set up Jetson in  and soon created a prototype.  They developed sensors, backup motors and speed restrictors to make it safe to fly. The Jetson One does not need a runway and has been built to ensure a perfect landing. Peter said he gets a request to buy one every  minutes.  He added: “Imagine turning up to McDonald’s in one of these. People will be thinking is that James Bond  Are they even from Earth ” The Jetson One weighs kg and can fly for  minutes, with a battery charging time of around two hours. It is controlled with a joystick but cannot be flown in cities yet and is only for open land. Peter said this will change and hopes to see % of all wheeled transport moved to the air by . He adds our cities will become greener with less need for parking spaces and roads. Peter’s next plan is to create a two-seater flying car by .

Taking to TikTok, -year-old Tammy Hembrow - who goes by the username @tammyhembrow - uploaded a clip of herself wearing silver high-waisted leggings and a matching crop top, baby bump clearly visible. To the sound of KyleYouMadeThataposs Poof Be Gone, the Australian Instagram fitness star - who is six months pregnant - can be seen aposvacuumingapos her bump away in a matter of seconds, simply by taking a big deep breath in.The video concludes with her laughing and clutching her stomach, apparently not being in any discomfort despite the dramatic effect. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. This marks Tammyaposs third pregnancy, with the gym expert already mum to son Wolf, six, and daughter Saskia, five.Sheaposs continued to share workout advice throughout her pregnancy, with vids showing her lting weights and keeping her back strong to reduce aches.Many have been left understandably puzzled by the clip, unable to work out where exactly the bump had gone or how she was even managing to do such a thing in the first place. A number of people wondered how the baby might be experiencing things, with one person exclaiming: BABY: WHY MY HOUSE IS BEING SMALL, SEND HELP, while another joked: Baby: aposmom I already told you I’m claustrophobicapos”. However, Tammy was quick to reassure her followers that what she was doing was perfectly safe, explaining that itaposs like hugging the baby.She added: I have to do it when I train, super good for your core doing it throughout pregnancy. Tammy is here trying an exercise known as the Bloom Method, which was first pioneered by Colorado-based pre and post-natal fitness expert Brooke Cates. When practising this method, pregnant women expand and contract their abdominal muscles using diaphragmatic breathing. The babies inside their wombs are pushed deeper into their abdomen as they inhale, and pressed forward as they exhale.

And with more people than ever turning to Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge to search for their special someone, itaposs important to know how to spot someone thataposs using another personaposs pictures to deceive their dates - also known as a catfish. A woman on TikTok named Jocelyn has shared her experience with a catfish in a video on her account, @jjustjocelyn, where she revealed she was planning to meet up with a Bumble match named Myles before a clue in his text messages set alarm bells ringing.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Jocelyn, from Ontario, Canada, explained that when she sent a text to Myles from her iPhone, the message was green - which indicated the number she was given was attached to an Android phone, as messages sent to other iPhones are blue. But in Mylesapos photos on his Bumble profile, he was clearly wearing an Apple Watch, prompting Jocelyn to do further investigation into who her date really was. She said in her video: I matched with this guy on Bumble, as one does. He was good looking, I was into it. I didnapost give him too much information about myself because Iaposve definitely chatted with people too much on the app.  He said we should get dinner sometime, and I thought that was great because obviously, I donapost want to talk in the app, I want to meet in person to seeI really like him. I give him my number and I say text me when and where we should meet for dinner. He texts me pretty quickly, and when I reply, I notice that itaposs green. Now, why does that matter  This is the guy I matched with. What is he wearing  An Apple Watch. What does green mean  It means he doesnapost have an iPhone.Jocelyn then said she stuck Mylesapos photos through a reverse Google Image search and found the pictures actually belonged to a model from New York named Ron - and not to the person she was talking to on Bumble.She added: I did a reverse image search of some of the pictures he used on his profile, and what do we have here  An Instagram model from New York! I live in Ontario, so thataposs not adding up.The guy I matched with is pretending to be somebody named Myles, not Ron, who is the actual guy thataposs in the pictures. Thankfully I had hardly spoken to this guy and Iaposd invested % of my time. Either way, stay woke ladies and stay alert. There are catfishes everywhere. And commenters on Jocelynaposs video - which has been viewed over  million times - were quick to praise the woman for her detective work. One person said: Good observation skills! And thanks for the tip. While another added: Youaposre basically a detective now. What a great catch. Jocelyn has even had a response from Bumble themselves, who have confirmed theyaposve removed the catfishaposs profile from their app. They said: We’re so sorry to hear about this! We’ve found the member and permanently removed them.If youaposre concerned about a potential catfish and want to double-check their photos for yourself, can perform a reverse image search by going to Google Images and clicking the camera icon, which allows you to either paste an image URL or upload a picture from your computer.

Ellie said she was shocked when Cleo said oh I havenapost had dinner for a very long time mum after she was rescued and taken to hospital for observation. She told how she is still trying to find out what happened to her little girl who is still dferent and that the family have a long way to go.  She said: “As a parent, you want to…make sure that they stay as a child for as long as they can because you don’t want them to be in this big, bad world, and she lost that, that was taken from her. “She’s probably going to have to be dealing with this for the rest of her le and we’re going to eventually have to find out everything that’s happened and we’re going to have to carry that as well.” Cleoaposs disappearance sparked a huge investigation and gained international attention. Terence Darrell Kelly, , was arrested on the same day Cleo was found and he pleaded guilty to forcibly taking a child aged under  at Carnarvon Magistrates Court.Appearing via video link from the high-security prison Casuarina Prison in Perth, he admitted his guilt and was referred to the WA District Court for a sentence mention in March. Cleo was awake and playing with cars when police found her at around am, Ellie said.  Police confirmed that the house was as it appeared in photos on social media with toys and dolls while Cleo told her mum that she could hear dogs barking, she added. Ellie also recalled the heart-wrenching moment she realised someone had my baby. “She was basically nowhere near me and that was the second I realised that someone had her and both my head and my heart connected to that, she said.  When the pair were finally reunited, Ellie said her daughteraposs first words were hi mummy. She said: “Cleo got onto the phone and she’s like ‘hi mummy’ and I was like ‘hi baby’.

One plan under discussion is to parachute members of  Para and nd Airborne into Poland as a dramatic signal of defiance towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.  On Monday Mr Wallace yesterday announced another  soldiers will be sent to Poland. Speaking in London alongside his Polish counterpart Mariusz Blaszczak, the Army officer said “In that spirit of solidarity and helping share each other’s challenges of resiliences we will add to those  Royal Engineers by sending a further  British troops to Poland in a bilateral deployment to show that we can work together and send a strong signal that Britain and Poland stand side by side.” Two senior defence sources have told the Mirror the troops are “highly likely” to be paratroopers and that many of them will jump into Poland from C- troops carrier warplanes. One insider said: “This has not been absolutely finalised but these troops will very likely be from  Air Assault Brigade and they will very likely jump in.” Sources say it is many years since American and British troops parachuted together into eastern Europe, although they have done it more recently in the States. More than  members of  Para’s B Company are already in Estonia on winter warfare exercises with NATO units including soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment. It is believed members of  Para will be asked to join US airborne troops in demonstrating what the Army calls a Joint Forcible Entry, dramatically dropping into Poland. They are part of  Air Assault Brigade - the UK’s high readiness troops mostly made up of Paratroopers, with signallers, medics and engineers attached.  After jointly parachuting into Poland they would then launch a -day wargaming exercise - as a huge two-finger gesture to the Kremlin, whose troops are currently exercising in Belarus. Sources say the Parachute Regiment is “extremely keen” to perform the drop with the Americans but the MoD and Number Ten are concerned it may be over-aggressive. Senior Parachute Regiment officers have already put forward proposals to PJHQ and the plans are being considered. One source told the Daily Mirror: “The plan is to jump with the nd Airborne who have already arrived, but there is concern and confusion at senior level that any drop will be seen as aggressive and we are waiting for a decision.” The Paras are listed as the UK’s Global Response Force, are already part of an operational readiness capability which was formed with US forces in . More than  British Paras dropped into Ukraine in September , in a joint exercise with local forces and witnessed by the Daily Mirror. They parachuted last year into Jordan with local forces, practising how to battle ISIS and al-Qaeda in counter-terror strikes - an exercise watched by fascinated Russian embassy defence staff.  America has sent , airborne troops into Poland because of the escalating Ukraine crisis and the UK is sending more troops into Estonia.Around  other UK troops are training Ukraineaposs forces in how to fire NLAW anti-tank weapons which have been provided by the UK - with another  preparing for an evacuation.And scores of Special Forces Support Group and SAS troops are in Ukraine secretly preparing to help stranded Brits evacuate by land and airwar breaks out.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “There are currently no plans for  Air Assault Brigade to conduct a jump into Eastern Europe.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British ArmyEastern EuropeAl-QaedaNatoMinistry of DefenceVladimir PutinSoldiersArmed forcesSpecial forcesFitnessUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The luxurious property, in an upmarket suburb boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms and world class views views of of one of Australiaaposs most famous landmarks. One of the propertyaposs biggest attractions is a aposmesmerisingapos m tunnel which took miners six months to excavate and even has some secret feature within it. Robert and Wendy Procter, brought underground workers from an opal mine in New South Wales to build the tunnel and during the build on the property in Mosman, Sydney.  The underground feature has attracted the attention of potential buyers after it hit the market with a  millionguide price. It has views over Sydney Opera House and the stone-walled tunnel even houses one of the cityaposs most coveted home gyms complete with a glass wall and wood flooring.Mr Procter told realestate.au : Itaposs a big house and the five of them stayed downstairs … the only thing we didnapost supply was alcohol which would have cost more than the tunnel. Described as very James Bond and high-tech by agent Jacqui Rowland of Di Jones Mosman, the stone tunnel stretches almost theof the entire plot and even has a gym in it. But it is the secret spy tunnel tunnel which has left potential buyers in awe of the property.It’s very James Bond and high-tech,” she told realestate.au. “You come out of the garage and walk into the tunnel, the lights come on and there’s music. It’s mesmerising.” The owners have been in the house for more than four decades but decided to build the underground channel to avoid walking  steps from the street to their house. Mr and Mrs Procter spent all of their million budget to create the game-changing tunnel leading from the double garage to a lt which comes to their home.  It means we donapost have to walk up  steps, which is particularly dficult in the pouring rain, Mr Procter said. Now the tunnel which can be accessed through the double garage goes past a subterannean workout area arriving at a the lt which brings users to their luxury home. In total, the project cost them around  million AUDbut the current owners love the addition.  As well as the wow which the tunnel brings viewers can also imagine themselves on its glorious sun balcony or visiting one of its many rooms or bathrooms.And thereaposs plenty of opportunity to enjoy the glorious weather, as the huge kitchen leads to a garden with a barbecue and entertainment area - as well as a heated pool and spa, sundeck and pond water feature.The estate agents realestate.au. say special equipment was used to bore through the stone.It says: The miners used jackhammers for the vertical lt shaft and a special machine that cut through the rock for the tunnel. He said including the lt and landscaping, there wasn’t much change from m for the work, which he says was well worth it. The views over the city are especially good at night when Sydney Opera House is lit up and can be seen from a distance.The outdoor space allows for some solace and is an oasis of calm in the midst of the bustle of the city.But the couple say the tunnel brings the added value and will see them make a tidy profit from their investment many years ago.  They put the grand mansion on the market for an eye-watering £million but only paid £, when they bought it more than  years ago. The property is on the market with DiJones, with expressions of interest closing on  February.

Several months have now passed since Cleo was reunited with her family but her mum Ellie Smith fears that she will never get over what happened.She said that the four-year-old would wake up shouting and screaming in the night initially.  And now she is scared of being behind locked doors while she insists on sleeping with the lights on. Ellie said how Cleo remembers how she was lured away. “She tells us that she was taken because her baby sister was sick,” she told  Minutes. “And so she needed to be taken away from us to that we could help her baby sister. She just knows a reason as to what he’s told her.”  Cleo’s mum told of the joy when she finally heard the news that she was safe, after receiving a call at am from police. She said: “I was asleep when the phone call came through and I was like ‘this is either good or bad’. I’ve answered it and straight away‘I’ve got someone who wants to say hello to you’ and I was swearing, I was like ‘oh my God, no way’. “Cleo got on to the phone and she’s like ‘hi mummy’ and I was like ‘hi baby’.”Back home Cleo quickly got back to playing with her baby sister Isla but Ellie feels that her child has been changed by what happened. She said how she is “dferent and always will be and that’s just our le now.” The toddler is blocking out what took place with her emotions up and down and Ellie feels that she went into “survivor mode”.

It is believed to be the latest attempt by Moscow to fabricate a threat of attack in order to justy the build-up to war whilst pretending to be fighting western-backed provocation. Last night a senior security source said: “It is such nonsense but people will believe such conspiracies and this is how it all plays out back home in Russia to justy war.  “This is all about justying an invasion but this time it does drag the UK into the plot, accusing it of backing so-called mercenaries in Donbas so it is ramping up pressure on NATO.” In a direct attack on the UK’s bolstering of security in Poland and training Ukraine troops in anti-tank warfare, it claimed the “Polish mercenaries” were British-trained. Russian media has reported that two groups of  “Polish-speaking mercenaries” had been identied on the front-line in Luhansk, according to one pro-Moscow separatist leader.  Lt Cold Eduard Basurin said during a conference held at a militia HQ in Donbas:“The presence of two armed assault groups of up to  fighters in mixed camouflage unorms has been noted in the zone of the Ukrainian th Mechanized Brigade.” It went to accuse the so-called ‘Polish mercenaries’ of attempting sabotage attacks but widened its deception campaign to the UK. According to quotes linked to Basurin: “The Polish mercenaries arrived in the area under the guise of instructors as part of the so-called Joint Forces formation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  “Before being sent to the Donbas, the members of these groups underwent military training under the guidance of British instructors. The Russian media even linked the so-called group of being members of extreme right groups in east Ukraine. In recent months Russia’s fake news squads have tried repeatedly to create a picture of Ukrainians being aggressive towards pro-Russians in the country. One video this week ly depicted a “Ukrainian” making a dirty bomb with which to attack Russian troops. The unprofessionally -made footage was unconvincing but sources say it is a sinister build-up to war against Ukraine and a possible invasion. It is believed this has been a bid to justy a war, full-on invasion or partial incursion into Ukraine.

Pluto is Nobody Dog’s longest resident and the friendly doggo has never stepped foot outside of the rescue centre’s ranch. And now, the manager of the centre says he will die there is nobody steps in to help. Pluto loves to be around other dogs, cats and children, and would thrive with an active family in a rural area. Alena Stan runs Nobody Rescue in Romania and works with the UK organisation, Bridging The Gap Rescue, to unite stray dogs from kill shelters with families across Europe.“He will end his le in the centreno one steps in and shows him the world,” Alena said. “I’ve had Pluto since he was four days old. “He was born in a public kill shelter with his mum and four siblings in December . “His mum and three siblings were adopted, and Pluto and his brother Dino were left behind. Sadly, Dino recently passed away - so Pluto is the last one left. Pluto is Alena’s longest resident at Nobody Dogs rescue centre and the sweetest boy. “The kennels and shelter is all he’s ever known,” she explained. “He has never left the ranch in the woods.” Alena describes Pluto’s personality as “very friendly and active”. “You wouldn’t know he is a senior dog,” she said. Pluto has never shown any signs of aggression, and gets on well with other dogs, cats and children. He walks well on a lead and would love to live with a family and kids in a rural space.  He has never heard any city sounds before or seen a television, so would need time and patience to adapt. Pluto has spent  years trying to find a place to call home, which has been a struggle for Alena. “We are a very small organisation and it’s dficult to adopt dogs in Romania. People don’t look at private centres,” she explained. While Pluto has lived a long and happy le so far at the rescue, it would be amazing for him to experience the rest of the world and find a permanent family.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him. Going forward, coming to us will suit him as he has an eye for a pass and an eye for a goal and is comfortable on both feet. He can go outside or inside and has a bit of pace.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The Royal Mint has revealed its top ten rarest  pence coins in circulation.The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.What makes a coin valuable The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

Meals.Children like -year-old Failo, whose le is in some ways no dferent to that of children living here in Argyll and Bute. He enjoys playing football with his friends and, in class, loves reading and writing.But his le can be very hard. He lives in a rural village in Zambia where there is no electricity and his windowless home is made from mud bricks.Food is scarce and Failo relies on a serving of porridge from Mary#s Meals each morning in school – often his first meal of the day.More than two million children in  countries eat Mary#s Meals every school day. The food attracts them into the classroom, where they receive an education that can, in the future, be their ladder out of poverty.Until January , donations made to this wonderful charity#s Double The Love campaign will be matched by a group of generous supporters, up to £. million – meaning even more little ones will receive a nutritious meal at school.We hope readers will visit marysmeals.org.uk doublethelove to donate."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 28 2022","story":"Candlemass, the Scottish Quarter Day, falls on February .It#s  days after Christmas Day, the day we take down our crib.It#s also halfway to the spring equinox.

than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

Considered to be more popular in the UK than in its native Australia, the show is produced by Fremantle Media for broadcaster Network  but it’s the partnership with Channel  which makes the production costs viable and have done since .

Well, for a few paragraphs at least. Let’s veer off instead to the Ryder Cup captaincy.In the modern era, the role of a Ryder Cup skipper has been elevated to such a venerated status, the position should come with its own marble plinth. Such exalted status brings its pressures, of course. Win that little gold chalice and you’ll be worshipped like Zeus. Lose and you’ll attract the kind of withering condemnation that greets anything that comes out of the mouth of Nadine Dorries.After Europe’s walloping at Whistling Straits last year, everybody was expecting Lee Westwood to be given the captain’s armband for the  tussle in Rome. But then Westwood withdrew himself from consideration and Europe’s chain of assumed succession, which seems to have captains in place for the next  years, was somewhat disrupted. Luke Donald has emerged as the favourite to take up the reins and certainly has plenty of backing among the current crop of players.In an interview out in Dubai with my good friend Martin Dempster last week, former Ryder Cup man Andrew Coltart belatedly flung Paul Lawrie’s hat into the ring. It was a thoroughly merited call and one that, perhaps, should’ve been hollered more loudly down the years.With a plethora of potential candidates stacking up in recent seasons, it seemed that Lawrie was too far down the pecking order to be considered. Why that should be the case, though, remains something of a mystery when you think about it.Here is a major champion, a multiple tour winner, a two-time Ryder Cup player and a staunch supporter of the European circuit who ticks all sorts of boxes. He was a vice-captain too in Darren Clarke’s  set-up. While Thomas Bjorn and Padraig Harrington, who were also part of that backroom team at Hazeltine, went on to become captains in  and  respectively, Lawrie’s credentials have been overlooked.Rather like Sandy Lyle before him, Lawrie’s hopes of performing a task he’d “love to do” have, realistically, passed him by. That Lyle did not earn the captaincy remains somewhat lamentable given that he was part of a famous five of European golfers who were all born within a year of each other and amassed  majors among them during a barnstorming spell of prosperity.Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Ian Woosnam all had stints as Ryder Cup skipper with ying degrees of success. Faldo, for instance, employed his own ego as a vice-captain and was about as popular as the emergence of a new iant of the coronavirus. While his reign ended in dismal defeat, the other three all got to the savour the victorious popping of celebratory champagne corks.Poor old Sandy, meanwhile, never did get his crack at the captaincy. “There is a slight unfairness about it,” he once said of a snub that cut him deeply. “I was due, definitely.”Lawrie’s not the type to make a big song and dance about it but the -year-old would be justied in feeling as aggrieved as his celebrated countryman. When it comes to the Ryder Cup, sometimes the captain’s cap doesn’t fit.AND ANOTHER THINGThe sums are astronomical. And, no, I’m not taking about my gas bill again. The other day, it was reported that Bryson DeChambeau had been offered around £m to be the poster boy of a Saudi Super League. Ian Poulter, apparently, has been teased with about £m and a whole host of others have signed a Non Disclosure Agreementforbidding any public discussions.Greg Norman, the man helping to drive the Saudi assault on the global game though the LIV Golf Investments company, had a pop at those questioning the Kingdom’s moves and motives last week during the launch of an Asian Tour event in England and said, “ you pre-judge anybody without knowing the facts, then shame on you.\" And now these facts are shrouded behind a series of NDAs  Oh, the irony.Amid all this, the bold Phil Mickelson ranted off to Golf Digest magazine and lambasted the “obnoxious greed” of the PGA Tour for not allowing him to earn more than the multi-millions he’s already earned in his career. He said this while standing on Saudi Arabian turf having accepted a huge case load of cash to play there. As an act of self-parody, it was broadly equivalent to a bloated Elvis mumbling his way through a series of Vegas ballads in a rhinestone jumpsuit.While us mere mortals gazed at the three-bar fire and wondered how much it would cost to turn it up, it was dficult to find much sympathy for big Phil pleading poverty."},{"url":null,"title":"charlie-guest-becoming-britains-best-female-slalom-skier","story":"These days, however, her outstanding recent form has ensured she is now known primarily for being Britain’s best female slalom skier for a generation. It is, admits Guest, a welcome sht to be talked about for her performances on the slopes rather than her miraculous recovery from serious injury. And as she heads into her second Olympic Games, she could not have timed her rise any better. Last month, in her final competitive appearance before Beijing , she wrote herself into the record books by finishing in th place in the Schladming World Cup in Austria, the best finish by a British woman in a World Cup race for fty years, backing up a string of World Cup top  results this season. It was the perfect confidence boost ahead of Guest’s second Olympics having made her debut in Pyeongchang four years ago and she admits she could not have hoped to be in a better mindset than she currently is. “I’m feeling really positive and I’m very happy with how the season has gone,” says the -year-old. “The past three seasons I’ve not had any major dramas and since October , things have gone from strength to strength starting with Europa Cup podiums to World Cup points to consistent World Cup top s so it’s been a really nice progression and it shows that I’ve put in the work and from that, the results are coming. “I’ve got a basic level now of physical ability and skiing ability that I know is there and there’s such a confidence that comes with that.  “Now, I know my skiing is good enough and will get me the results I want and so learning to believe in that has been a real game-changer over the past few months.” Guest’s current injury-free status is a far cry from the almost constant battle she was forced to endure in her early career. In , as a -year-old, she suffered a fall in training, fracturing four vertebrae in her spine. A y rehabilitation process followed, with the after-effects of the Perthshire skier’s injury lingering for many years, with her build-up to the  Winter Olympics severely marred by so many injury worries that she was far from her best when she arrived in Pyeongchang and as a result, her Olympic debut was nothing like the thrilling experience she had hoped for. “On Boxing Day four years ago, I couldn’t walk. I could hardly stand up without almost passing out. “So ahead of the  Games, it was purely about proving I was fit enough to still go and so when I got to the Olympics, it was an “oh, sh*t” moment knowing I absolutely wasn’t prepared for it.” Her back injury is, admits Guest, something she must remain mindful of but nevertheless, she has been in the shape of her le this season, with her impressive performances down, in large part, to the fact she has not been forced to spend signicant amounts of time and energy patching herself up. And so the stark dference is she has arrived at this Olympic Games with an optimistic outlook, which is something of a new experience for her. “I’ve never had this feeling of going into an Olympics feeling well prepared and like I can really do something,” she says. “The four years between breaking my back in  and Pyeongchang in  I remember as being pretty rubbish whereas I’ll look back on these past four years as everything having gone so much better and that’s something me and my team can be really proud of.” Guest hails from a family of skiers growing up in Perth, she and her three siblings spent many a weekend at their grandmother’s house in the Cairngorms, which is where Guest, and her younger sister, Katie, who is also an international skier, honed their skills. The Olympic Games will not mark the end of Guest’s season, with the remaining few World Cup races and the World Cup finals still to come.  Guest currently sits in th place in the World Cup standings andshe can remain there, will become the first female British slalom skier in her letime to qualy for the finals. First, however, is the small matter in hand of making a mark on the Olympic stage. Guest will begin her slalom campaign in the early hours of tomorrow morning, alongside fellow Scot, Alex Tilley, with American superstar, Mikaela Shfrin hot favourite to regain the title she won in . Guest is all too aware that competing in such a volatile event as the slalom means setting concrete targets is always tricky but nevertheless, she is quick to stress that she is in Beijing with lofty ambitions. “For me, a top- placing would be excellent,” she says.  “Despite Pyeongchang being a bit of a negative experience in terms of my performance there, having experienced what an Olympics is like and being able to go into this one knowing what to expect has been a massive thing and really helpful. “So I’m more excited about coming into these Games in such good form than feeling any kind of nerves.” "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stop-causing-needless-alarm-elderly-pensions","story":"I don’t doubt the complexity, but have the authors overstated the uncertainty The UK Government’s own document “State Pensionyou retire abroad” states in its first sentence “You can claim State Pension abroadyou’ve paid enough UK National Insurance contributions to qualy”, making clear that following payment of contributions there is a liability to pay a state pension, consistent with the terms of the scheme at the time.Of course, these terms can change, “reduce, or even, in principle, eliminate”. Certainly, the state pension has ied in real value over the years, but it is no less clear that, in any post-Yes vote negotiation, pension liability could not be valued on the basis of something that might or might not happen several years later.As for elimination of pensions, the politics of telling the UK’s grey vote, and the expats all over the world, that they are not getting their pension any more is, in terms of political disaster, much worse even than Downing Street parties.Likewise, it is possible that the UK Government might challenge its liability on the basis that “the tax and NICs made by Scottish residents were used to pay for public services that they previously enjoyed”, but this is not what its own website says. Moreover, would this argument be applied to pensioners in the continuing UK Lastly, as the authors point out, “the UK Government can change the qualying rights for state pensions as it sees fit”. However, how can this be done to exclude only Scots. What would a requirement, for instance, to live in the continuing UK mean for British expats living in Spain Many of the uncertainties in the report are therefore just too horrible politically to contemplate, or involve so many dficulties that their complications would surely triumph. The logical solution is surely to negotiate an agreement about ision of assets and liabilities, and secure reciprocal agreements. I don’t doubt the complexity or that certainty is imperfect, but with goodwill on both sides, rather than weaponising the issue to cause fear among the elderly, I am sure a solution agreeable to both sides can be forthcoming.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SNPS WISHFUL THINKINGI NOTE the debate on the SNP’s assertions that the UK would fund Scottish pensions after independence. This is an extreme case of wishful thinking, as today’s taxes pay pensions, because there is no pension pot to draw on.At present the workers in the  million population pay the pensions of that population. If Scotland were to be independent, surely the workers in the  million population of rUK would pay the pensions of that population and the workers in the six million population of Scotland would pay our pensions Why would the UK Government agree to fund, out of current taxation, the pensions liability of a dferent country, when that country is receiving the tax from their own workers at the same time Scotland has a demographic handicap with fewer working people supporting all forms of benefit. The SNP solution to this is large immigration of young people, which kicks the can down the road as they will all be old and entitled to a pension one day. Pension planning in the UK and Scotland is broadly similar to a Ponzi scheme, where increasing the population gives more workers to pay pensions and benefits. This lets politicians pass the problems associated with us all living longer down to the next generation.Nicola Sturgeon says that people will notice no dference or get a bigger pension this is extremely unlikely, given that it would need the UK politicians to completely capitulate to the SNP viewpoint.The experts writing in your paper on Saturday, David Bell of the University of Stirling and David Eiser of the Fraser of Allander Institute, seemed to suggest that a fudge agreement would be most likely .Certainly more of a drawback to, than an advantage of, independence.John Leonard, Falkirk.HAVE A PLAN BEFORE THE SPLITTHE dissolution of the United Kingdom brought on by Scottish independence means that the two newly-independent entities would have no claim to UK Treasury funding as the UK would have ceased to exist. In other words pensions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland would not be paid by the UK nor would Scotland’s pensions.Arrangements would have to be made prior to the split ensuring that the qualying conditions for pension payments to former UK pensioners apply equally to both new states perhaps continuing to be based on the qualying conditions of the former UK pension scheme.Payments up to the date of the split could be overseen by a joint board of the two new states and financed by the same mechanism as before. In effect all previous UK pensions would continue to be paid as normal and from the same revenue base. This revenue stream would be the same as before but now burcated. Both new states could then review the amount of pension paid within their jurisdictions.Don Ferguson, Kirkintilloch.WE NEED ALL THE ANSWERS EARLYI WOULD sincerely hope that all negotiations regarding finance, pensions, taxation, border controls and so on are satisfactorily settled before any independence vote. Otherwise the Scottish electorate will have no understanding of the effects of voting Yes.No intelligent person votes for something without knowing what they will get as a result.Previous voters were not told of the chaos which would ensue when voting to leave. We need the truth of the outcomes before there is a vote.Barbara Jarvie, Milton of Campsie.NORWAY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICESI ALMOST choked on my Corn Flakes this morning while reading Michael Sheridans letteron the subject of Norway.Norway, in his view it seems, is only a thriving economy thanks \"disproportionately\" to the might of Great Britain and the United States, who apparently have kept the \"free world\" open and alive to capitalist endeavour. That world order, it would appear, has provided infinite pathways, both physical and financial, for Norway to expand and flourish.No mention of the mighty \"free world\" heroes having invaded or plundered other nations, stolen their resources or having killed their indigenous populations throughout history, in pursuit of the great capitalist utopia. Mr Sheridan goes on to deride Norway for pursuing \"a long-standing policy of military neutrality and exclusion of nuclear weapons\". How very dare they!We are urged by Mr Sheridan to believe that the rest of the \"free world\" is to be grateful to the might of Great Britain and the United States for the free flow of capitalism, and that Norway is a political passenger and a fortunate beneficiary of our unparalleled might.Hilarious.Kevin Orr, Bishopbriggs.* I AGREE with Michael Sheridan that Norway is not a legitimate comparator for Scotland but disagree with his reasons for saying so. The crucial dference, which appears to have escaped Mr Sheridans notice, is that Norway is an independent nation and Scotland is not. He employs the blatant oxymoron of explaining thatall the nations of the free world shared Norways aversion to militarism and nuclear weapons there would be no free world.Norway, as a free and independent nation in the s, was able to make its own choices regarding North Sea oil and gas our Scottish nation was in a very dferent situation and it is now clear that great efforts were made by the UK Government at that time to conceal the full potential economic benefits of North Sea resources from the people of Scotland.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WILL THE SPIN DOC SURVIVE BORIS Johnson’s new Director of Communications, Guto Harri, told the press that our beloved and boisterous PM sang \"I Will Survive\" when they met on Friday. I presume then that Thursday evening’s party was still in full swing.The PM clearly impressed his new flunky, who described him as \"not a complete clown\".

It’s about Saturday. We’ve started off well, don’t even mention those two words! Honestly, let’s keep our feet on the ground.  “We’ve beaten England before – we beat them last year and we didn’t win anything . “I would like to think Scotland have got a very good chance of winning on Saturday and then we’ll worry about anyone  after that.” Scott was equally exasperated. “I look back to the squads of  and  when nobody was thinking ahead, it was literally about the next game,” said the former centre. “They just concentrated on what was in front of them next. Nobody got carried away, especially the media.” Perhaps there is more hype now than these two legends experienced in their pomp, but the game has moved on from those amateur days of dignied understatement, and they acknowledge that it would be much worsethere was no optimistic chatter surrounding the Scotland team this week because that would mean that they had come up short against England last Saturday. As it is, the Scots are flying high after achieving back-to-back successes against the Auld Enemy for the first time in  yearsand are looking ahead to a trip to Cardf to take on a Wales team reeling from their - drubbing at the hands of Ireland at the weekend. So, this refusal to jump on the hype train should not be mistaken for a lack of admiration for what Scotland have achieved so far – or a lack of belief in what is possiblethe players and coaching team keep their focus. “You look at that performance by Scotland on Saturday and there was a full understanding of everything that happened in that game: from Finn Russell’s kicking to the defensive , to the way they coped with England’s power up-front,” agreed Scott. “In the past, some of their games have been littered with simple mistakes, but there was a unity in that performance. When Scotland go down to Cardf, they must continue to turn the screw. “The Principality Stadium Stadium will be a tough nut to crack, so they just have to knuckle down and concentrate on their own game,” he added. “There have been times in the past few years when they have gone there, played that high-tempo style, and then fallen out the game. “You have to still be in the game in the last  minutes. On Saturday they stayed in the game, stayed confident in the way they carried the ball into contact, and it will have to be the same in Wales. It is going to have to be like Groundhog Day – repeat, repeat, repeat.\"Meanwhile,Gavin is frustrated that his son, stand-off Adam, was not involved in last weekend’s game and is not going to be involved in this coming weekend’s match having been left out of Townsend’s training squad for this campaign, then he was not letting on. “I thought Finn Russell [the incumbent stand-off] had a magnicent game against England and his goalkicking was key to that, as was his kicking from hand,” he said. “His thread-through in the second half when England had lost Luke Cowan-Dickie was a massive moment. His game management was terric.” The Grand Slam Dinner is being held at Edinburgh International Conference Centre on Saturday st May, with tickets now on sale. The event – which is being held to help raise awareness and funds for Hearts + Balls, a charity which supports former players who have suffered serious injuries – was supposed to take place back in  to mark the th anniversary of the  Grand Slam but was postponed due to Covid. “Rugby has sorely missed these big group celebrations - and charities have been hit hard by not being able to utilise vital fundraising streams,” said Scott.  “Of course, the evening will be incredibly enjoyable, but to be able to know that we’re making a real dference to members of the rugby community who need our support makes it all the more special. “Hearts + Balls is an incredible charity that every single one of us is proud to be able to support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"todays-wordle-answer-clues-wordle-234-tuesday-february-8","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters which is wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter F.Another clue  Its useful for pictures.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions. The success of DRS in Scotland, however, will depend on ensuring we get the details right, not just in our cities but in rural and island settings as well.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People who keep testing positive can also request a review by a medical .Mr McCloskey noted that people who were infected can continue testing positive intermittently for a long time, eventhey are not contagious.But he said previously infected people might also be testing positive because they were reinfected, and are able to spread the virus.“The challenge is to distinguish the two,” he said.Organisers said they expect the number of positive cases to decline as new arrivals into the Olympic bubble taper off, since screening procedures are intended to catch the virus early and prevent it from spreading.Mr McCloskey noted that everyone in the bubble is being tested and that nearly everyone has been vaccinated.“I think your chance of picking up Covid in the closed loop is less than anywhere  in the world,” he said.So far, there have been  positive cases inside the Olympic bubble. In addition to athletes, the figure includes news media, team officials and others inside the bubble.More than , people have arrived from outside China for the Olympics.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times.Here in Norway toll roads is common to finance such projects#get the funding from the Scottish Gov and get on with it.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Credit: Niall Carson PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast City Councilis set to launch legal action in a bid to compel Edwin Poots and the Government to meet the requirements of the NI Protocol.The move comes after Mr Poots, the Agriculture Minister, last week ordered his officials to halt Brexit agri-food checks at Northern Ireland#s ports. The decision was then suspended by a High Court judge until a judicial review against the DUP minister’s decision can be heard in full. Mr Poots# instructions were not carried out by his officials, pending legal clarity on their obligations.The protocol was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland by placing checks on some goods moving from Great Britain to NI. Unionists say this has harmed businesses and threatens Northern Ireland#s place in the UK.Sinn Fein brought a motion to a special meeting of BCC on Monday, which read: This council wishes to place on record its concern with the actions of Minister Poots relating to the withdrawal of checks required for the implementation of the Protocol and his failure to comply with an International Treaty and legal obligations negotiated by the British Government with the EU.The council further notes with concern that this is likely to impact its ability to meet the legal obligations for which it is responsible, relating to inspections at the Port. This council authorises the City Solicitor to commence legal proceedings to compel the Minister and the British Government to comply with Protocol requirements, subject to any current derogations in the grace period.Sinn Fein’s Ronan McLaughlin said the DUP had been shafted by their own British Prime Minister over his previous pledge that there would be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea and blamed the situation on internal DUP politics.He said, because Mr Poots ordered Daera staff to halt checks, BCC staff would in turn be breaking international lawhis orders were followed, as BCC staff at ports are also involved in the checks. DUP councillor Brian Kingston said his party is against the implementation of an Irish Sea border, which is harming the economy. We will continue to get it scrapped or fundamentally changed, he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The motion was passed, with in  voting favour and  against.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Ralph HewittTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHolyland residents have instructed a Belfast law firm to consider taking immediate legal action against the PSNI, the Department for Justice and the city council in an effort to stop anti-social behaviour in the area.Phoenix Law’s Darragh Mackin confirmed a number of residents in the south Belfast area are looking to “challenge the current regime in place”.The Holyland area has been plagued for years by anti-social behaviour from both young people and a minority of university students moving into the area.Almost  young people gathered for a street party during Freshers’ Week in September, resulting in three arrests and more than , bottles of alcohol being confiscated by police.The PSNI increased patrols in the Holyland during Freshers’ Week and St Patrick’s Day, handing out a number of Covid notices. But the problems continued to persist.Police were also investigating an incident in October where footage on social media appeared to show a group of iniduals throwing a plant pot at a resident’s car.Phoenix Law partner Mr Mackin stressed the potential legal action is aimed at protecting permanent residents in the area by ensuring safeguards are in place.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This is not a situation whereby it is residents against students as often inferred,” he told the Belfast . “In fact, it is the very opposite. The reality is the residents have been, and continue to be, let down by the ineffective practices and procedures in place to protect those iniduals who live in the area.“It is the worst kept secret that there continues to be illegal occupation of multiple person properties with little or no review or investigation.“Further, the area continues to produce high levels of anti-social behaviour with limited and intermittent policing response.”Mr Mackin added that residents have been left to fend for themselves “for too long”. “We are now instructed to consider immediate legal action against both the council, the department and the PSNI for failing to ensure the necessary protections and safeguards are in place for those residents who we represent,” he stated.Long-time residents’ campaigner Brid Ruddy, who is one of the Holyland residents involved in the case, welcomed the expected legal action. She agreed with Mr Mackin that the issues in the area are not “a tussle” between dfering lestyles of residents and students, but a failure by relevant agencies to put an end to noise complaints, fly-tipping, anti-social behaviour and houses of multiple occupancy .“Yes, a lot of the anti-social behaviour comes from a minority of students who are a disgrace to the student body, because not all students are like that, but the cause of it is the total failure by the agencies to really look after this area,” stated Ms Ruddy.“It has been left to degenerate into an HMO slum.”Reflecting on the trouble within the Holyland over the past year, Ms Ruddy said it never gets any better and now occurs seven days a week. She added that people go to the area to party because “they know there will be no repercussions” and said the “absurdity of it all” was highlighted when a communal Christmas tree installed by residents was stolen in early December.“The police and council just keep saying they’re working in partnership models with others,” said Ms Ruddy. “The partnership model doesn’t work. We can’t keep on doing the same thing and expecting a dferent result.”The PSNI, Belfast City Council and the Department for Justice all said they have not received any correspondence relating to legal proceedings.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandBelfast City CouncilDepartment of JusticeMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandPSNI appeal after several people held over man’s murder are released on bailEight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police OmbudsmanNineteen PSNI officers suspended amid sexual misconduct investigationsAntrim man doused with heating oil during arson attack on his homeHate crime rises in Northern Ireland with racist incidents showing biggest increaseMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsLatest Northern IrelandPSNI appeal after several people held over man’s murder are released on bailRoyal salute: gun fired at Hillsborough to mark th year of Queen’s accessionLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’Belfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleLatestApprentice winner Leah Totton sees revenue and profits riseSam BeattieOpinionNew tax year brings a new approachJohn SimpsonOpinionReview brings challenges for Invest NICiti’s Belfast site lead Leigh Meyer: ‘We are offering a career in Northern Ireland, not just a job’Newry sports tech firm signs major US deal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We will only fix that by speaking to the UK Government and to the EU, to get them to understand that feast or famine, to fix the problems that we’ve got.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up All other parties bar the TUV have criticised the DUP’s move, in particular as it means victims and survivors of historical institutional abuse will not receive the planned formal apology from the First and Deputy First Ministers.Sinn Fein’s former Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The DUP’s actions in unilaterally resigning from the Executive are reckless and they’ve caused concern and uncertainty for businesses, for workers, for families and campaigners on a range of many important issues.“In terms of the victims of historical institutional abuse, it has caused real hurt and trauma.“And while the DUP must bear responsibility for that, I’m also very conscious that those of us who are serious about showing responsible leadership and delivering for people can and should seek to salvage what we can from the chaos the DUP have caused.”DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he was surprised other parties couldn’t see the role they played in the First Minister’s resignation.“Because we had a debate in this chamber some time ago when the SDLP, Sinn Fein, Alliance and Green Party all called for the rigorous implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” he added.“Now, we got a report from the EU Commission some weeks ago that was put in the Assembly library, which indicates what the rigorous implementation of the protocol is. That for some years those people who would be travelling back from ious parts of the world through Aldergrove Airport would have seen a notice about bringing food in, or anything from third countries, what they’re supposed to do.“And the EU are expecting us to do that on food coming in from Britain. Now, how many planes, how many trucks, how many cars are coming in from Great Britain to Northern Ireland every day “And the EU are demanding that we go in and ask people to open their suitcases, to open their bags, andthere’s a few mandarin oranges that they bought for the children on the way home on the ferry, that’s an at-risk item.”Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson won’t be visiting Northern Ireland imminently, following calls from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to do so amid the political crisis.Downing Street said Mr Johnson was monitoring the situation at Stormont closely, but there were no plans for the PM to travel over.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinNorthern Ireland AssemblySDLPNI ProtocolPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillTraditional Unionist VoiceEdwin PootsBoris JohnsonMore On Ulster Unionist PartyCity council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleStormont crisis: We must salvage what we can from the chaos caused by reckless DUP, says Michelle O#Neill PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumGrassroots unionists back my calls: DonaldsonMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsLatest Northern IrelandPSNI appeal after several people held over man’s murder are released on bailRoyal salute: gun fired at Hillsborough to mark th year of Queen’s accessionCity council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleTesco Valentine’s ‘snub’ a steak through heart of NI romanticsLatestApprentice winner Leah Totton sees revenue and profits riseSam BeattieOpinionNew tax year brings a new approachJohn SimpsonOpinionReview brings challenges for Invest NICiti’s Belfast site lead Leigh Meyer: ‘We are offering a career in Northern Ireland, not just a job’Newry sports tech firm signs major US deal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press EyeFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailJust a few weeks ago, the Executive announced the relaxation of a raft of Covid- safety measures and promised more were on the way.Describing his delight at the development, former First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped the Executive would be in a position to review remaining restrictions this Thursday.Read MoreRobin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reform“The February  date will be an important meeting now for those outstanding measures that are still in place,” he said. In particular, he said he wanted to see the removal of the controversial Covid certicate scheme: “The DUP has been opposed to its introduction, today we’ve made big progress in reducing its application and I want to see further progress.”Throughout the pandemic, a number of DUP members have been high-profile opponents to many of the Covid restrictions — think Sammy Wilson describing face coverings as muzzles and Paul Frew leading the charge against offering vaccinations to children and mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers.DUP politicians have increasingly raised concerns about the effects of restrictions on the economy, apparently keen to lt the measures as soon as possible.However, following Mr Givan’s resignation, it has been left to Robin Swann to find a way to lt remaining restrictions as hospitalisations and deaths linked to the virus begin to drop.Despite all its previous posturing about the damage being caused by the Covid restrictions, it appears the fight to rid Northern Ireland of the Protocol is the priority for the DUP.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result, Mr Swann, like all remaining ministers, is having to navigate a unique environment at Stormont. Firstly, he has to ascertain whether he can remove restrictions without the collective support of the Executive.Then,he gets the green light, it has to be established how this can be achieved. But the headache doesn’t stop there — as Mr Swann pointed out on Monday, Northern Ireland is finally moving out of the latest Covid- surge. With fewer people requiring hospital treatment for a Covid infection, it seemed like NI was inching closer to the point where it could begin the long and onerous task of rebuilding our decimated health service.So, last week’s decision by the DUP to remove Mr Givan from his post has been a hammer blow to the thousands of NHS staff crippled by the ravages of the pandemic and the hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hospital treatment.When Mr Swann on Monday said “our health service urgently needs an end to political point scoring”, he was absolutely right.An inclination to put votes before support for much-needed reform has already caused untold damage to the health service, while waiting lists spiralled after the Assembly collapsed in .Mr Swann had the unenviable task of tackling the issue and he admitted on Monday that it was going to be a signicant challenge. Yet now he is not only in a position where he will be solely responsible for bringing to an end Covid restrictions so detested by many, but, as hundreds of thousands of people languish on hospital waiting lists, he will be able to blame the current political instability for their suffering too.Related topicsRobin SwannThe Executive OfficePaul GivanUlster Unionist PartyPaul FrewMore On Robin SwannCovid-: what are the remaining restrictions in Northern Ireland Robin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reformHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsSenior NI medic Dr Alan Stout ‘massively disappointed’ by resignation of DUP’s Paul Givan PremiumScrapping hospital car park charges in Northern Ireland ‘would cost cash-strapped health chiefs almost £m a year’ and could damage patient care, Stormont toldMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsLatest Northern IrelandPSNI appeal after several people held over man’s murder are released on bailRoyal salute: gun fired at Hillsborough to mark th year of Queen’s accessionLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’Belfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveTesco Valentine’s ‘snub’ a steak through heart of NI romanticsLatestApprentice winner Leah Totton sees revenue and profits riseSam BeattieOpinionNew tax year brings a new approachJohn SimpsonOpinionReview brings challenges for Invest NICiti’s Belfast site lead Leigh Meyer: ‘We are offering a career in Northern Ireland, not just a job’Newry sports tech firm signs major US deal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Department of Finance handles personnel issues for the NICS.Pay awards for  and  were reflected in pay scales published last June, but thousands of agency workers are still waiting to receive these pay increases.Responding to an Assembly question, Mr Murphy said that, based on the estimated , agency staff awaiting the  pay award, the average back pay owed is £. This means the estimated total owed in back pay is around £.m.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It is the responsibility of the Civil Service’s contracted recruitment agencies to pay their employees the appropriate rates of pay and manage any pay adjustments or claims for back pay during the contract term, Mr Murphy said.NICS HR officials in my department continue to support the recruitment agencies to complete the remaining calculations of back pay due to their employees.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “The Executive parties have sometimes referred to the cost of living crisis, but the truth is, they have done very little to protect people in the midst of one.It is shocking that at a time when the cost of food, energy and other household items are through the roof, Finance Minister Conor Murphy still hasn’t acted to ensure agency workers are paid the average of £ that they are still owed. The minister has tried to repeatedly evade responsibility for acting on this, but ultimately it’s his departmentthat are funnelling millions into the coffers of these agencies.“It’s worth seriously thinking about how much this owed money would assist low and underpaid workers to afford to heat their homes or to pay for the weekly shop at a time when the cost of both is rising through the roof.”In addition to the estimated , agency staff awaiting the  pay award, there are also , workers waiting for last year’s pay rise.Announcing pay parity for NICS agency workers in October , Mr Murphy said: “As is the case in many organisations, agency workers play a key role in the Civil Service and the delivery of services. Under this new contract, agency workers will have parity with Civil Service permanent colleagues in terms of pay, annual leave and paid time off for medical and dental appointments from day one.“The Civil Service is committed to looking after the health and wellbeing of all those working in the NICS. I believe these enhanced arrangements for agency workers demonstrate our commitment to workers’ rights.”Last summer, a report found that an average of . days were lost per NICS staff member in the previous financial year, representing .% of the available working days. This is down from an average of . days the previous year.The NICS absence level for   was the lowest recorded in more than  years. Related topicsConor MurphyDepartment of Finance Gerry CarrollMore On Conor MurphyUnionists alienated and instability increased by NI Protocol, Orange leaders tell Taoiseach Premium, Northern Ireland civil servants still waiting for pay increaseStormont minister Lyons ‘confident’ over Boris Johnson’s pledge to replace EU funding PremiumSam McBrideOpinionSecrecy and power: What Sue Gray’s two NI sojourns reveal about her PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in fundingMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsLatest Northern IrelandPSNI appeal after several people held over man’s murder are released on bailRoyal salute: gun fired at Hillsborough to mark th year of Queen’s accessionLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’Belfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleLatestApprentice winner Leah Totton sees revenue and profits riseSam BeattieOpinionNew tax year brings a new approachJohn SimpsonOpinionReview brings challenges for Invest NICiti’s Belfast site lead Leigh Meyer: ‘We are offering a career in Northern Ireland, not just a job’Newry sports tech firm signs major US deal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A lot of people drive down and park on the beach. It was meant to be after high tide,” she said.“We have enough experience on that beach – you think we’d know better, but we walked up to go and get a coffee and the waves were coming right in, past the coffee area right at the top there.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “All the cars were getting completely swamped, there were a few animal baskets getting dragged away, luckily there were no animals in there, all animals were safe.“It was just crazy.“There were a group of ladies going in for a swim and a few of us were a bit concerned. We were saying ‘Be careful, maybe don’t go in or,you are, maybe don’t go too deep’. Then that surge came in, just before they went into the water, thank goodness, it would have been enough to take them off their feetthey had been in.”Anna said people need to be wary of strong currents.“The pull is so strong back out again,” she added.“That is why we have been putting up messages on social media for people to stay out of the water oryou are going into the water make sure you do an appropriate risk assessment and don’t go in far. I would just say don’t go in, to be honest.“When you first drive down you don’t think it is so bad but the waves out far are really big and they are breaking really big.“We drove round to Portstewart as well and because the waves are breaking so close to shore you can see the size of them.“I know the reports are that it is going to be building all day. Hopefully the surges won’t be coming up quite as far with the tide going out.”Locals said the surging waves can happen frequently.A spokesperson for Maritime and Coast Guard Control based in Bangor said further wave surges were expected into the afternoon yesterday, but the worst had passed.They encouraged the public not to put themselves into danger attempting to capture any photographs, never to turn their back on waves and to “stay high and stay dry”, by keeping away from dangerous and rough sea conditions.Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayOfficial trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandPSNI appeal after several people held over man’s murder are released on bailRoyal salute: gun fired at Hillsborough to mark th year of Queen’s accessionVoice of loyalist paramilitaries tells UUP: act like unionistsCity council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleLatestApprentice winner Leah Totton sees revenue and profits riseSam BeattieOpinionNew tax year brings a new approachJohn SimpsonOpinionReview brings challenges for Invest NICiti’s Belfast site lead Leigh Meyer: ‘We are offering a career in Northern Ireland, not just a job’Newry sports tech firm signs major US deal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues.

Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday. His son, Neville, still has horses in training. The late Drew Reid also from Banbridge, rode many of Victorrsquos horses in point-to-points.A notable absentee at the entrance on Saturday was William McDowell, although he was present.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This means a shuttle service should be offered to ensure those without access to car transport can still access the popular  Express service.”Councillor McGurk added that she undertook a review of rural transport in the wider Dungiven area in  and presented her findings to Translink who had committed to increase services from some surrounding villages to Dungiven to the current  services. “Unfortunately due to Covid these increased services didn’t get the chance to be implemented.

be instructed to remove all such items from the cemetery graves,” the notice read.The reminder sparked confusion among local residents, with many taking to social media to voice their thoughts on the issue.Several stated they were unaware of the policy and queried whether the rules had recently changed, while others suggested the removal of tributes by council staff was ‘unfair’ and ‘upsetting’ for the families of the deceased.Larne Lough Alliance Party Councillor, Danny Donnelly stated that he had been contacted by a number of residents over the regulation. “This rule has been in place since at least  I have discussed it with officers after seeing posts on Facebook and hearing from a few people unhappy with this situation,” he said. “It’s clear that this ruling only refers to Christmas wreaths. \"The council has a responsibility to keep cemeteries tidy and respectful of families who visit them to see the graves of their loved ones.”Cllr Donnelly added that he had requested that the issue be added to the agenda for the next meeting of the council’s Direct Services Committee on February .Coast Road DUP Councillor, Andrew Clarke said he was \"pleased\" to see that the council had since suspended the policy. \"Good to see this will now be part of a wider review into grave management,\" a post on Cllr Clarkes Facebook page read.\"It is important that council deal sensitively and sensibly with grieving relatives.\"Commenting on the matter, a spokesperson for Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said: \"As an interim measure, the council have agreed to only remove damaged or wilted wreaths from graves, where identied, in council-run cemeteries.\"This will allow officers to carry out a review of the cemeteries policies.”Read More Read MoreAlmost  burials

Pre-pandemic there was no express provision for remote meetings for district councils.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Addressing the chamber Councillor McGurk, who has always spoken in favour of remote meetings and the flexibility they offer councillors who work or have young families, said: “It was agreed on the evening that we would take a consultation back to the DfC remote hybrid meetings consultation. I believe a draft has been forwarded and I’m quite happy that we adopt that draft as a response to the consultation.“I noted in the content of the draft that the Democratic Services had estimated a saving of approximately £, in members travel for the year   and I think that’s astonishing and it certainly gives us some quantitative evidence to what I have been harping on about much to others dismay, that we really should be looking at remote or hybrid meetings as a way forward for quite a few of our meetings. I would like to propose that we adopt the draft that was circulated to members.”PUP Councillor Russell Watton described the semi empty chamber as being in ‘Old Trafford because there’s nobody going to that at the minute either’.He described the situation as ‘dire’ adding: “Some councillors haven’t been in here for two years and then you have some complaining about bad connections, they could be in here no bother.“It’s less of a council when you are sitting with  or  people. I just can’t see it as a way forward, it’s better being in here, you can see what’s going on and you can tell what people think. It’s dire, I would rather have  sitting here as .”Before taking the vote the Mayor, Councillor Richard Holmes said: “Councillor Watton I share your sentiments.”The proposal to adopt the draft consultation passed with  votes for and  against.Speaking after the council meeting, Councillor McGurk said: “I know the will is there with the majority of members, however there are a few dissenting voices which tend to overshadow other opinions sometimes. “I do recognise there are some meetings that arguably should be done as physical only such as full council meetings where the full council body meets. “Having some physical meetings would counteract some of the negative impacts of remote meetings such as councillor relations, etc, but in general remote and hybrid meetings are too powerful a tool now to ignore and go back to the old ways of doing things just for the sake of it.“The benefits of remote meetings are immense and wide ranging for example cost savings to the public purse.“Democratic Services worked out that a saving of £, was made on members travelling expenses alone in  . This is before we take account of the cost of staff being given time in lieu to attend meetings where they may have had to wait around all night for their item to come up.“I also believe remote hybrid meetings have made council business much more accessible to the public and it allows council members and staff to balance their work and personal lives around council duties much more effectively. “I know from my perspective I have a full time job in construction, and a young family with three children – having to travel to multiple meetings in Coleraine and where wastes so much of my time and doesn’t allow me to use that time to spend with my children, etc. “At the moment I am still able to come back from work, have dinner as a family, help my husband get the kids ready for bed and even get the younger ones down before a pm meeting starts. “A physical meeting would mean me travelling straight to Coleraine after work and not having time to stop in and participate and help with our family evenings.“I would be hopeful that longer term this would encourage people from non-traditional sectors of society to come forward into politics and have a greater representation of vulnerable minority groups.”Read More Read MoreNeed for Translink shuttle to Dungiven park and rideCauseway CoastNorthern IrelandSinn Fein  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsMasked men set home and car on fire in Carnlough...News‘Innocent omission’ costs Tyrone barber his licence...NewsDiamond Centre evacuated...NewsMost PopularHome office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have w...RecommendedHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router ext...RecommendedSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back.
