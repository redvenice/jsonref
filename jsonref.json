Heard filed for orce the following year, and the orce was finalized in 2017.The former spouses have both been in court during three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building.Ms Wass reminded Mr Justice Nicol there were \u0027well-documented episodes of violence and destruction\u0027 over Depp\u0027s adult life and that the actor had accepted he was violent to inanimate objects but not people.However, she said there was an incident earlier in his career when he assaulted a photographer with a plank of wood when under the influence of drink and drugs.She also said his evidence that he was not violent towards people was \u0027meaningless\u0027 when he was as intoxicated as he was on occasions and \u0027wouldn\u0027t have known what he was doing\u0027.Ms Wass continued: \u0027In answer to what we suggest is overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, catalogued over a three-year period between 2013 and 2016, Mr Depp\u0027s response is to claim that he is a victim of an elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated against him by Ms Heard and her friends.\u0027The barrister said Depp had accused Heard and her friends of \u0027having painted on injuries, manipulated photographs and destroyed property which they then went on to photograph in order to create what he describes as some sort of insurance policy for Ms Heard\u0027.Ms Wass added: \u0027What exactly Ms Heard was insuring against in the course of this hoax remains unexplained.\u0027She told the court that such a hoax \u0027would have entailed Ms Heard engaging in a pre-planned conspiracy over the period of the entire relationship with Mr Depp\u0027, adding: \u0027Such a suggestion, we say, is risible.\u0027Ms Wass told the court: \u0027The approach taken by Mr Depp from the time Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him on May 27 2016 was as follows: to deny that he ever assaulted Ms Heard, to accuse Ms Heard of being the violent party and to reverse his role with hers.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Joe Bidens speech notes included praiseworthy notes Kamala Harris","story":"Share this articleFalse alarm: Politico \u0027technical error\u0027 identifies Kamala Harris as Biden VP pick"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/0C068B1800000578-5548741-Kate_and_Gerry_McCann_mark_the_fourth_anniversary_of_the_disappe-m-2_1524816157149.jpg","title":"Madeleine McCann investigators resume digging German allotment","story":"Share this articleShare this articleFall Maddie: Polizei setzt Spurensuche in Garten bei Hannover fortFall Maddie in Hannover: Ermittler finden Keller auf Gartengelände - News Inland - Bild.de"},{"url":null,"title":"Oldham overtakes lockdown Leicester highest second coronavirus infection rate England","story":"Share this articleExplained: What caused Oldham\u0027s new coronavirus crisis, where are the spikes in infection rates and how will the town get out of this? - Manchester Evening NewsManchester Evening News: Number one for news, opinion, sport \u0026amp celebrity gossip"},{"url":null,"title":"Bakery turns away customers aged 94 86 didnt cards wanted pay cash","story":"Share this article She said around eight elderly people had been stopped since the store reopened in April but most elderly people were now using cards in their store. Ms Clarke added: \u0027If they have not got a card unfortunately we can\u0027t give them the goods.

For it to be a successful night, remember it’s all in the planning ... Since coronavirus has shrunk our social spheres, intimate garden parties have become something of a trend. Thanks to street-wide WhatsApp chats and local volunteer groups, eclectic new friendships have been forged – and as the weather’s improved, online quizzes with distant relatives have segued into alfresco drinks with new and nearby friends.While we’re all being urged to stay alert, the easing of lockdown rules means we can meet up with more of our friends. Outside the permitted bubbles in each area, the 2-metre rule remains in place in Scotland and Wales, while iniduals in England and Northern Ireland must stay at least 1 metre apart.But groups of friends can now gather together outside – any sized group from up to two households can meet in Wales up to six people from different households in England, with no limit on people from two different households in Northern Ireland, groups of up to 30 people can meet and in Scotland, up to 15 people from up to five different households can meet outside per day – all while keeping a distance.All of which means summer isn’t cancelled, it just looks somewhat different to how we imagined – but we can still get ready to brush up on our barbecuing and hosting skills.Now it’s trickier to go to the corner shop for extras, planning is of the essence. Here are our tips for hosting the perfect post-lockdown barbecue, and enjoying a safely sociable summer.Be considerateThe first rule of new-normal socialising is to be respectful of everyone’s boundaries. You might not mind sharing food with your guests, but others might be more anxious. Find out what everyone’s comfortable with before you plan your party – and if one of your friends would prefer to bring their own food, be prepared to be OK with that.Shop smartThanks to socially distanced shopping, the etiquette of putting on a barbecue has changed, too – it’s now perfectly reasonable to ask people to bring their own food or drink if they want something specific. Meanwhile, make sure you provide enough basics, to avoid a dash to the shops, mask in hand. You can find barbecue calculators online that will tell you how much meat, veg, side dishes and drink to buy depending on the number of people attending.Buy localWhile your online shop is ideal for stocking up on basics, a barbecue is the perfect excuse to explore your local area and uncover some hidden foodie gems. From artisan ciabatta rolls and locally produced meats, to small-batch chutneys, cheeses and ale, it’s a great time to support the independent stores reopening after lockdown. As well as boosting the economy, buying locally sourced produce keeps your carbon footprint clean, too.Stock up on masksJust as you’d make sure a guest didn’t drive home after a few drinks, protecting them if they have to get a cab or public transport home is equally thoughtful. Buy some masks to hand out to anyone who might suddenly need one at the end of the evening.Play it safeYou can’t control the weather – but you can make sure staying safe feels like a natural part of the party, rather than a chore. Put out plenty of hand sanitisers and wipes for guests, hand out glasses marked with their names, and hang 2-metre-long strips of bunting as a visual reminder not to mingle too closely. Spacing out your garden furniture around a central hub, such as a fire pit, will also help remind people to keep a distance without dampening the atmosphere.Create a signature dishWith more of us cooking at home than ever, it’s worth taking the time to develop a dish that will really wow your guests. Whether it’s making a lip-smacking vegan pulled “pork” (try BOSH’s for inspiration) or perfecting an all-American regional burger (make George Motz your go-to for recipes), head to your local butcher or farmers’ market, and start planning a grill everyone will remember for the right reasons.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

The supermarket chain, which along with fellow German chain Lidl have been the fastest-growing UK supermarkets in recent years, plans to open an average of one new store a week between now and Christmas.“As much as the disruption of the past few months has been challenging, it has also reminded us that there are still hundreds of towns across the UK where shoppers don’t have access to Aldi’s award winning quality products and unbeatable prices,” said Giles Hurley, Aldi UK’s chief executive.“To continue doing this and meet our goals of making Aldi accessible to even more shoppers, we will need thousands more amazing colleagues across the country. I look forward to welcoming each and every one of them to the team.”Aldi said it will open new stores at locations including Sandhurst, Bristol and Edinburgh this year, and plans to create 1,200 extra roles before the end of 2020 as its expansion continues.The retailer, which has more than 890 stores and about 35,000 UK staff, said it has already created 2,800 new permanent jobs this year after grocery sales surged during the coronavirus pandemic.However, Aldi and Lidl have not enjoyed the same level of sales boost during the Covid-19 pandemic as rivals including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons as they do not offer an online shopping service to customers.In May, Aldi struck a deal with takeaway courier service Deliveroo to offer a grocery home delivery service.\u0026nbspThe previous month Aldi launched a £24.99 grocery parcel service direct from its warehouses comprised of 22 essential products – such as rice, pasta, toilet rolls and tea – designed to help elderly and vulnerable shoppers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321b74455394ca3880a3955ae832cee205eb5cfd/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd55965f52d3527c77c827cdd8b0c498","title":"aston martins losses soar to 227m in first half of 2020","story":"Aston Martin Lagonda’s losses surged to £227m in the first half of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic closed the embattled UK luxury carmaker’s dealerships and prompted an executive clear-out.The carmaker was also forced to restate its income statements over two years after detecting an accounting error that led it to overstate profitability in 2018 and 2019.Aston Martin has endured a torrid 12 months, as heavy spending on a new factory for a new car, the DBX SUV, followed by the pandemic pushed it close to bankruptcy. Its main plant, at Gaydon, Warwickshire, is only due to resume manufacturing at the end of August, later than originally planned.In January the billionaire fashion mogul Lawrence Stroll led a consortium that in effect took control of Aston Martin in a bailout shortly before the pandemic forced a deep drop in sales. Stroll has focused on restoring profitability at the carmaker, as well as firing Andy Palmer as chief executive and in his place installing Tobias Moers, the former boss of Mercedes-Benz’s performance ision, AMG.Aston Martin was also forced to restate its income statements for 2018 and 2019 after overstating profits by £15.3m in 2019.The new management found an error in the way the US region was recognising revenues that meant it counted payments to dealers and discounts for retail customers later than it should have done.Stroll, who took the role of executive chairman, said it had been “a very intense and challenging six months” and the company pointed to more difficulties ahead. Reducing the number of cars at dealerships, a key aim of Stroll as he tries to restore Aston Martin’s air of exclusivity, will continue until 2021.In its statement to the stock market, Aston Martin said: “Trading remains challenging in many markets and the pace of emergence from lockdown and consumer recovery varies significantly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e379fa2a2de66021f716442905dbcd8ad023d8/225_244_3241_1945/master/3241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d408b3a464e6205832963f647c8fe2ee","title":"barclays profits plunge covid 19 defaults","story":"Bank’s second-quarter loan loss provision takes total credit impairment charges to £3.7bn The second-quarter loan loss provision was more than the £1.4bn analysts had expected and brings total credit impairment charges to £3.7bn for the six months to June. It is also three times the £408m charge it logged last year.Barclays said it reflected a forecasted “deterioration” in some parts of the economy, including a prolonged period of higher unemployment in the US and UK. However, this has been partially offset by the impact of government and central bank stimulus measures.The bank’s group financial director, Tushar Morzaria, said economic models were pointing to a relatively shallow recovery. “We’re not assuming a sort of very sharp snap back.”He said the bank had “quite significantly” increased provisions for potential defaults in high-risk sectors such as airlines, retail, hospitality and transport, which have been hard-hit by the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. Barclays said its total exposure to those sectors was £20.7bn.While Barclays said it expected lower loan loss provisions in the second half of the year, it warned that the next six months would be difficult.“Given the uncertain economic outlook and low interest rate environment, the second half of the year is expected to continue to be challenging,” the bank said.Barclays said its capital buffers – which ensure the bank can absorb major losses – were strong, but its chief executive, Jes Staley, struck a cautious tone. “Though we will remain well capitalised and ahead of our minimum requirements, we may experience stronger capital headwinds in the second half of the year,” he said. However, Staley said the bank’s risk and exposure levels were very different than they were during the 2008 financial crisis, and meant it could play a very different role in the recovery.“Our hope is to be a firewall in the economy recovery and in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic it’s much different than what happened with the banks some 10 years ago,” Staley said.Barclays has so far extended 600,000 payment holidays to customers affected by the pandemic and provided £7.7bn worth of government-backed bounce back loans and a further £2.5bn in coronavirus business interruption loans.However, Staley said demand for emergency funding and payment breaks had “slowed markedly” in recent weeks. The bank is gearing up to help businesses raise funds on financial markets, a trend that could further benefit its investment bank.“The financial markets are increasingly open,” he said. “So if you’re a company and you’ve got some financial challenges and you’re in the leisure sector or the travel sector, you can go out and raise new capital in the public markets. That’s probably one of the greatest things that we can do financially to provide financial security for these corporates.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19387fc35192251a3a05f97a68c5750897ad58f6/0_144_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f707ebdb19761689840e0a5f8b6c74c0","title":"next expects remain profit sales partially recover","story":"The business has upgraded its annual profit guidance to an expected £195m this year and said that even in a worst-case scenario, where the high street is hit by a second lockdown, it will still manage a £15m profit. The retailer, which made almost £600m in profits last year, said in April it could post losses of up to £150m this year.“Our experience over the last 13 weeks has given us much greater clarity on our online capabilities during lockdown and the state of consumer demand, and we are now more optimistic about the outlook for the full year than we were at the height of the pandemic,” Next said.Next said sales of childrenswear, home, nightwear and sportswear, and some adult casual clothing, had sold much better than formal clothing related to work, going out, overseas holidays and large social events.“Sales were dealt a devastating blow during the lockdown but have bounced back at an astonishing rate,” said Richard Lim, the chief executive of research consultancy Retail Economics.“Next’s nimble response to the pandemic highlights the inherent flexibility of their operating model and strength of the business. After years of investment in their digital operation, they are well-positioned to capitalise on the seismic shift we’re witnessing towards online.”“As a general rule, our out-of-town retail parks have significantly outperformed shopping centres and high street locations,” the company said.It said store revenues were partly impacted by the decision not to heavily promote its end-of-season sale to avoid the large queues of bargain hunters the chain normally attracts. Next also started the event on a Thursday, instead of the usual Saturday, to “reduce the risk of overcrowding”.The company also had to limit the stock available in its online sale because of the reduced capacity of its picking staff in warehouses owing to social distancing measures.The company said it was developing plans to further improve the capacity and efficiency of its warehouse operation to boost its online operation in the second half of the year. It intends to introduce new 24-hour working shift patterns, and better support the online warehouse operation during sales periods.“Our online warehouses have achieved much higher capacities than we thought possible,” the company said. “While much of our time has been focused on managing the business through the pandemic, we have not lost sight of the fact our sector was already experiencing far-reaching structural changes as consumers increase their expenditure online. If anything, these changes are likely to accelerate as a result of the crisis.”Next warned that its guidance of a “central” scenario of £195m profits could not be guaranteed, given the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus.

The benefits would be huge Last weekend’s rapid government U-turn over travel to Spain has left both tourists and holiday companies reeling. Who can be sure of flying to any country if a quarantine can be imposed at such short notice? Arguments are now raging over whether the government acted too impulsively and failed to consider the consequences. Yet, for the most part, these all miss an essential point: that encouraging travel abroad in the middle of a pandemic makes no epidemiological sense.With every arriving overseas visitor or returning holidaymaker, the risk of bringing Covid-19 into the country increases. The government has so far justified allowing this travel because it believes community transmission of the virus in the UK is inevitable until a vaccine arrives. It is not.Great Britain and the island of Ireland are just that – islands. Other islands, such as New Zealand and Taiwan, have shown that the Covid-19 virus can be eliminated like the first Sars virus. In these countries, life is going on largely as usual with families gathering, full stands at sporting events, and internal economies almost back to normal. Shakespeare called England: “This fortress built by nature for herself against infection.” And now the Independent Sage committee (which shadows Britain’s official science advisory group) and other experts have called for a goal of zero coronavirus – elimination of the virus – rather than settling for suppression. Of course, both New Zealand and Taiwan avoided substantial “first waves” – making their tasks much easier. Both also scaled up their public health workforces to aggressively test, trace and isolate cases and their contacts. But both, even now, have mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for incoming travellers.Yes, international tourism has dried up, but it has been replaced by domestic tourism. And despite this, these countries are hardly isolated – the proportion of Taiwan’s GDP accounted for by external trade is double that of the UK and continues largely uninterrupted. Can we replicate these successes in the UK and Ireland?Ireland and Scotland had large epidemics, with the death rate per million in Ireland being fractionally higher at its peak in late April than that of the UK. But both Ireland and Scotland have brought their infection and death rates down dramatically. Last week the Republic of Ireland reported 11 Covid-19 deaths, and Northern Ireland and Scotland reported none. England and Wales’ combined populations are five times higher than the other three countries’ total, yet the number of deaths in that week was many times greater. Ireland and Scotland demonstrate that the virus can be almost fully suppressed even after a strong first wave. Can we reach beyond that to elimination?There is a technocratic objection to the word “elimination”. In infectious disease circles it usually refers to absence of community transmission in a country or region, for some substantial period (for measles, it is 12 months). Because outbreaks may still occur, many specialists prefer the concepts of infection “control” or “suppression”.In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, it seems reasonable to define elimination as a preliminary, though not necessarily durable, absence of community transmission. New Zealand has had no community-transmitted cases for nearly three months (all new cases have been in quarantined arrivals from overseas). In the context of a worldwide pandemic, as Australia has found, reintroduction of the virus from abroad is an ever-present threat.First minister Nicola Sturgeon has claimed that Scotland is “not far away” from eliminating coronavirus, and a committee of Irish scientists has called on their government to adopt a policy of virus elimination. Such a goal has three major advantages over suppression: absence of transmission means no Covid-19 illnesses and deaths life and the economy can go back to a (guarded) level of normality and it makes a second wave in the winter much less likely.So if we want to avoid a “November nightmare” and have a relatively “normal” Christmas, a push for elimination gives us the best chance.But is elimination achievable? We think it is – though it would require major changes to the British government’s current thinking. A bold elimination goal would require further strengthening of the test, track and isolate system with clear, transparent and spin-free reporting of its successes and failures. The release of data to local public health authorities is a welcome first step. It would entail income support for people who are asked to self-isolate, and consideration of supervised hotel accommodation for those who represent a risk to their families.It would also require abandoning the troubled air-bridge system – the deficiencies of which are becoming increasingly clear. So, for British people planning their summer holidays, it would mean replacing trips abroad with UK travel. Of course, international airlines will need subsidies to avoid bankruptcy it would also mean that lorries arriving in the UK would be driven to their destinations by British drivers.All this is a big ask. But the prize is huge. It would mean a relatively normal internal economy, with domestic tourists replacing international ones. The prize is getting children back to school releasing our aged population from home isolation or confinement in care homes protecting our black and minority-ethnic communities revitalising the arts and sport. And a reduction in the probability of a second wave in the winter, crippling the NHS and requiring a second national lockdown.We all hope one or more vaccines will work and be relatively free of side-effects, but experience shows we cannot assume such a vaccine will be widely available any time soon.Compared to the costs, the benefits are huge. This prize is within our grasp. It’s up to our politicians to change course and seize it.• David Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford Neil Pearce is professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f0d59c0c3226f58f9d6363a18363eae1738a2e7/0_19_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4b00b74262c5db81493e6a2eb28a34b","title":"ireland utopia neighbour gurning claptrapocracy coronavirus uk mess","story":"The country’s mild competency over coronavirus can appear to be stone-cold genius compared with the UK’s blundering mess‘I think being a woman is like being Irish,” wrote Dublin-born novelist Iris Murdoch, “everyone says you’re important and nice, but you take second place all the time.” I sometimes think this sentiment reflects my own wariness as an Irish person of taking too many compliments from overseas, and explains why I find congratulations for the country’s current government a bit unsatisfying.The Economist recently called Ireland “an unlikely diplomatic superpower”, while a leader on these pages praised the “enviable beauty” of the Irish political climate. After years of alternating between calling Ireland’s Brexit tactics cynical and naive, even the  this month praised Ireland for “taking over the Eurozone” and “extending their grip” on the continent’s institutions. Having negotiated its way through the Brexit morass, swerved the worst of Covid-19, secured a seat on the UN security council, and won a historic EU judgment that means they have the right to insist the world’s richest company does not pay us any tax – hurrah! – Ireland’s place in the global hierarchy appears on the rise, and the UK has continued marvelling at the shrewd cunning of their plucky little neighbour.Why, then, does this praise seem faint, or unearned? It’s not that we hate adulation. Seeking flattery from abroad is one of Ireland’s most crippling and shameful addictions, right up there with Garth Brooks or pairing coleslaw with lasagne. This is a fact confirmed any time a foreign celebrity appears on Irish telly. “So tell me,” RTE talk show host Ryan Tubridy will dutifully ask Greta Thunberg or Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, right after they’ve finished talking about their work clearing minefields for Unicef: “What is your favourite thing about Athlone?”It’s just that Ireland hasn’t turned into some 24th-century futurist utopia so much as installed sensible public policy that should seem unremarkable in a modern democracy – and in fact, given most western responses to the coronavirus, actually is unremarkable. This government has received praise at home for its response to the crisis, but we should remember that its unheralded Fianna FáilFine Gael coalition-of-the-boring was instituted to obstruct Sinn Féin, who just this year saw an unprecedented leftward surge in support from people tired of both main parties.While Ireland has received plaudits from the World Health Organization for its dealing with the current crisis, the same mistakes with care homes were made in Ireland as elsewhere, and small clusters of infection have re-emerged in recent days. The idea of Ireland as a model of competence in the field of social and public health is also one most Irish people might find surprising, since it has its own issues that rarely attract attention from afar: a mounting housing crisis that currently means 10,000 people are homeless in one of the hemisphere’s richest states a rolling series of healthcare scandals surrounding everything from poor bed provision to faulty cervical cancer tests and the remarkable saga of the new National Children’s hospital in Dublin, originally budgeted at €400m but is now forecast to be costing around €2.4bn, making it one of the planet’s most expensive buildings. Ireland’s decision to enter lockdown earlier than Britain was a good one, but only in comparison with the grievous laxity of our easterly neighbour. The early days of Ireland’s track and trace app are showing positive results, but this is a success unduly magnified by the British government’s initial resistance to such technologies, and subsequent failure to launch one that doesn’t break its own data protection laws. Irish people have largely followed the protocols as advised, but they’ve also enjoyed relatively consistent, sober messaging from government, media and health experts. This is in contrast to than Britain’s bewildering stew of denials, contradictions and outright political chicanery around adherence to their own guidelines – none of which have faced any serious consequences from the UK’s parliament or largely right-leaning press.It’s on this last point that one might find a meaningful distinction between the two countries. While England’s political culture is notoriously barbed and acerbic, Ireland’s is rather strait-laced and sedate. Irish newspapers may be dismissive and hectoring when it comes to Sinn Féin’s surge in support, but they rarely depict them as communists who live in bins. They afford a soft touch to government ministers who have to be woken from a nap in the Dáil to vote against workers’ rights, but stop short of exalting them as celestial objects bestowing sunshine on their grateful subjects. Despite this, the Irish press has landed more recent hits on their government than their English counterparts. Earlier in July, Barry Cowen’s 17-day tenure as a minister for agriculture was ended after a slew of coverage of a years-old, and spent, conviction for drink driving. Compare this with the lack of any consequences for Dominic Cummings, or the fact that both Priti Patel and Gavin Williamson regained senior ministerial posts shortly after being sacked for actions that almost reach the definition of espionage.It’s this sense of political unseriousness that seems the most marked difference between the two places, and it says less about the “enviable beauty” of Ireland’s system than about Britain’s further slide into a fact-averse, consequence-free banana republic of malevolent toffs. This style of politics had ruinous effects on the Brexit referendum and the subsequent EU negotiations, and has now become criminally disastrous in a pandemic that’s costing many more lives in Britain than their nearest neighbour.For all its other ills, Ireland has not yet disposed of experts, accountability or political memory. These things are taken seriously, and a combination of steady, boring diplomacy and common-sense public health measures are granting Ireland greater praise than they should, now that those approaches can be so readily contrasted to our American and British counterparts. It’s a sort of “clowns to the left of us, jokers to the right” arrangement, which continues to herald great acclaim for an Irish government so dysfunctional that Leo Varadkar spent a day last week briefing against his coalition partner, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, on whether their green list of accepted travel destinations should even be released.Praise for Ireland as shrewd and canny operators gets the diplomatic calculus back to front. Ireland is not outflanking a competent, longstanding neighbour. She just has the pleasure of being compared with the gurning claptrapocracy next door. So long as Boris Johnson waffles, prevaricates and sees fit to place the NHS on the table for sale, amid the strongest surge in its appreciation since its founding, Ireland’s mundane governing coalitions will continue looking important and nice by comparison."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8375cc77cf3f79db61c3c0f63b364c9834e959/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d2a0f1ab107e50070696d4bceb5a1291","title":"selma edmund pettus bridge john lewis","story":"Many locals take pride in the fact that a bridge named to honor a Confederate general now represents civil justice. They must decide its futureThis past Sunday, I was privileged to attend the final crossing of the late congressman John Lewis over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in my hometown of Selma, Alabama. Watching him cross the exact bridge where he was beaten decades ago while marching for civil rights was an emotional and full circle moment.Thinking about John Lewis and his works made me think about how we live in a world driven by trending topics. Every hour of every day is controlled by a new conversation started by either a viral tweet, a lone interview or an online video, such as those of protesters felling Confederate statues this year amid an uprising against police brutality. However, the debate over whether or not to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named after a Confederate general and Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, in Selma, is decades in the making, as is the fight for civil rights. And it’s not as simple as it may seem.Selma has always been considered the beating heart of the voting rights movement, because of the historic march to Montgomery. During the first attempt on 7 March 1965, marchers led by Lewis, the late Dr Frederick D Reese, the late Hosea Williams and others were met on the other side of that bridge by state troopers on horses, and billy clubs. In the aftermath, the nation watched in horror as the troopers forcibly drove the marchers back to Brown Chapel AME church, leaving a trail of blood and injury in its wake.That day, which we recognize as “Bloody Sunday”, forever changed and shaped how the Edmund Pettus Bridge is viewed. So it is no surprise that there is opposition to the growing calls to change its name. For many of my neighbors, the Edmund Pettus Bridge is not and will never be a symbol of Edmund Pettus himself, but of the events that transpired there. Many Selma natives, including Congresswoman Terri Sewell, take pride in the fact that a bridge intended to honor a Confederate general and Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan will forever be known as a representation of voting equity, civil justice and hope. It is an irony that can work in our favor, and a symbol of victory over evil.Additionally, many of our foot soldiers, those who participated in the original marches, and surviving members of the movement feel as if they have been forgotten in this debate. Over the years, we have seen sitting presidents and other leaders come to Selma once a year to commemorate the Bloody Sunday march, while making commitments to work with Selma to ensure its legacy is preserved and protected. However, many of these commitments never see the light of day, and those who fought for the country’s voting rights are left behind and out of the debate altogether.There have been numerous petitions and calls made by notable people such as Ava DuVernay and Tyrese Gibson for years to bring Pettus’s name down. And with recent events there is more pressure on Selma than ever to take down statues of Confederate generals and even state flags with Confederate symbols. Even Sewell changed her stance, saying that this moment – spurred by recent protests – meant challenging some of those beliefs. But I believe that should we change the name now, it should not be because of the national push, but because of a genuine attempt to honor John Lewis, who was born just 86 miles away.I am a true proponent of honoring heroes in the proper manner. When it comes to renaming the bridge in his honor, I believe you cannot necessarily limit just one honor to the works that John Lewis has done for the advancement for not just Black Americans, but for every American. Renaming the bridge, then, would not only honor Lewis but serve as a model for how we educate students about the civil rights movement. Our schools now only teach bits and pieces of a story that should be rendered in its entirety.But it’s important that the deciding factor ultimately be left to the local community here in Selma. There are economic, political and legal impacts that affect Selma’s citizens that will not affect others who do not live here if we rename the bridge. With the changing of the name, what will that look like for Selma? Is there an economic plan in place to ensure that Selma will thrive even after we are no longer the trending topic? Are we properly prepared for the legislative battle that will be in store with this process? It is absolutely crucial that the opinions of our people are not forgotten and there is work actively being done to ensure that will happen.I have had the privilege to travel to numerous places, and I can confidently say that there is no place like Selma. My home town changed the world and I believe we are still more than capable of doing it again. The truth is that Selma was organizing before 1965 and continued to organize after. This past weekend has inspired me, as I hope it has inspired everyone to get into some of what Lewis called “good trouble”, and the people of Selma should determine what that means for our bridge.Collins Pettaway, III is a native of Selma, Alabama.

Planning before a shop is the behaviour that most people were likely to continue after lockdown, the study found.Peter Maddox, director of Wrap UK, said: “We’ve seen clearly how effective the Love Food Hate Waste messages and tools are – we need to reach more people to widen our impact. The more novel and innovative ways we find to engage with new audiences about this, the greater our chance of meeting the crucial target of halving wasted food by 2030.”The campaign will also highlight the environmental benefits of reducing food waste. For example, if the UK stopped wasting uneaten bread, the amount of CO2 equivalent saved each year would be equal to more than half a million return flights from London to New York.“Wasting less food doesn’t have to be complicated or time-consuming,” said Helen White, Wrap’s special adviser on household food waste. “It can be as simple as leaving the skin on when you make mash, or freezing more food before it passes the ‘use by’ date.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24d6cd01e764492d636caca5f41529ca44478ed7/24_40_2304_1382/master/2304.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d508cb15a1737dbe87c4f10c2f77bf01","title":"boys state sundance texas documentary apple tv","story":"In the Sundance award winner, teenage boys gather to simulate government in Texas. The result is part Lord of the Flies, part promising futureIn the summer of 2018, as the midterms heated up and the Trump administration made a national flashpoint out of America’s southern border, over a thousand high school boys descended on the state capitol in Austin, Texas with one mission: elect and run a state government.The week-long simulation of representative democracy known as “boys state,” designed to cultivate America’s next generation of political leaders (prior participants include Bill Clinton, Cory Booker, and Dick Cheney), had made headlines the year prior for passing a resolution for Texas to secede from the Union. That debacle – a miniature of America’s rightwing, spectacle-hijacked political system – caught the attention of married film-makers Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine, who joined the boys at the capitol, cameras in hand.“Suddenly they hand the program to the boys, for worse and for better,” said McBaine. “And for a moment, it’s Lord of the Flies.”McBaine and Moss spent three months prior to filming interviewing high school students at American Legion offices across the state, looking for a “cast” to follow – in verité style, with the air of an elimination survival show – throughout the whirlwind week. In San Antonio, they met Ben Feinstein, a double-amputee and self-described “political junkie” who entered determined to run for governor, the program’s highest-ranking position, with a bootstraps mantra of “hard work will get you far, but you may need to work harder”.In Houston, they discovered Steven Garza, a soft-spoken yet unwaveringly idealistic Latino student – son of a gas station worker, out of place among a largely white, conservative-skewing crowd – who arrives wearing a Beto O’Rourke T-shirt and emerges as the film’s star in his underdog run for governor.Once filming, the crew followed Robert MacDougall, a roguish, swaggering charmer from Austin with second-nature magnetism of his peers, and René Otero, whose electrifying crowd command cements him as one of the leaders. A Chicago transplant and one of the program’s few black participants (“I’ve never seen so many white people in my life,” he remarks upon arrival) Otero’s unshakable confidence and cutting humor quickly win him favor – and a hostile, ugly impeachment backlash – as Nationalist party chairman opposite Feinstein, the Federalists’ win-at-all-costs chairman.Boys State, as a film and exercise, doesn’t reflect the makeup of the nation – the Texas program is overwhelmingly white and there are, to noticeable effect, no women present – yet the film nevertheless presents a consuming portal into both 2020 masculinity and the sliding scale of American political values. It can be heartwarming, when people such as Garza and Otero summon voters’ better natures, or when MacDougal adapts from obscuring his beliefs (he’s personally pro-choice but incorrectly assumes the majority of the crowd would be anti-abortion – “That’s politics,” he says, “sometimes you can’t win on the opinion in your heart”) to Garza’s heart-on-his-sleeve campaign.And then there are the familiar strains – the ease with which demagoguery and showboating, particularly on the second amendment, drown out everything else the power of one’s worst impulses, exacerbated by the performance of masculinity and concentrated in personal and racist attacks or gossip.If anything, the barreling, unpredictable trajectory of the film, with all the buzzing energy you would expect from 1,100 17-year-old boys ping-ponging into self-governance, demonstrates that nothing in politics is inevitable or fixed the compounding of inidual choices, styles, and levels of seriousness steer and alchemize the whole affair in ways breeding both hope and cynicism.For the participants, now two years removed from the exercise, the week crystallized a variety of reflections on the fruits of political participation. The fish-in-conservative-water experience “is what every liberal needs,” Otero says halfway through the week, because it “forces you to think”. But by the end, Otero emerged disillusioned with the idea of running for political office, preferring instead the avenue of activism, education and nonprofit work, though he noted to the  that his experience as a party leader provided “hope” in that “there is an American public who understands what good leadership should look like”.MacDougall, now 20 and a military cadet at West Point, reflected on his “that’s politics” stance of with more circumspection: “Way too often I think that is politics and I wish that it wasn’t,” he told the , and added that Garza’s campaign “showed me firsthand throughout the week that that does not have to be politics.”“The fault of the simulation of boys state is that it immediately pits the two parties not as separate entities co-existing, but two entities who hate each other,” Garza, now 19 and living in Houston, told the .Still, he walked away from a Hollywood-level climactic election (no spoilers here) with “an even greater idealism than I had going into it, just knowing that you can build a coalition of people who don’t agree with each other, but want to support a certain candidate because they truly believe that that person wants to work with them.”For Feinstein, who by the latter half of the week resorts to personal attacks on Garza’s gun rights activism and ludicrous but effective theater against Otero’s handling of town halls, rewatching the film prompted significant reflection on the tactics deployed to win. (“I think he’s a fantastic politician,” Otero says of Feinstein in the film, “but I don’t think ‘fantastic politician’ is a compliment, either”). “Had I known what was going on on the other side of the curtain,” seeing the fellow participants as potential friends rather than high-stakes enemies, “I might have acted differently,” Feinstein told the . Instead, he modeled what we see everyday in horserace mentality of American politics. “All the adults smear each other so of course when I’m 17 and I want to win, I’m like, ‘Let’s do it this way.’”Watching Garza and Otero play to people’s better angels was, he added, “an important reminder that idealism can work and idealism should be the way it works.”Ultimately, an exercise such as Boys State offers a “reminder that democracy isn’t a spectator sport,” said Moss. “It’s not something we can take for granted its health and vitality depend on willingness to both understand it as a process and as something that we all need to inidually invest in in different ways.”“With the challenges that we see in representative democracy every day of our lives currently,” added McBaine, “I think that reminder was something that we felt we needed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8822e1b293738683e6d08d86f0df2198164e3b15/0_1784_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb6a9d88162a11884a393f61d5c6653","title":"how to use up leftover treacle molasses and syrup","story":"Inspired ways to use up leftover treacle, molasses and syrupI find myself buying molasses, syrup and treacle for specific things, only to be left with half-empty bottles of sticky things. What can I do with them?Lily, Greenford, MiddlesexItamar Srulovich, one half of the couple behind Honey \u0026amp Co, is the master of squeaky-clean molasses receptacles. “We have a fatwa on half-used bottles,” he says. “Everything that can be done, we’ve done.” This shouldn’t be at all surprising, considering how versatile fruit molasses – date, grape, pomegranate – is.Even the dregs are good news. Srulovich pours boiling water into near-empty bottles, shakes then pours the contents over a roast chicken 10 minutes before it’s done. “It caramelises and becomes a sticky, sweet-and-sour glaze,” he says. “I can’t even tell you how good that is.” Alternatively, Ghayour mixes the molasses into cocktails – gin, vodka or “your favourite mixer” – treating it as you would lemon.Where there are drinks, there should be snacks, and Ghayour bathes nuts in molasses and spices, toasting until dried out. Or, add a splash of maple syrup instead (plus a handful of seeds). This liquid gold is not just for drizzling, mind: it can add depth to barbecue sauce, roasted veg and vinaigrette, too.I would wager many are in a sticky situation with treacle. Its most high-profile relationship is, of course, with ginger (ginger snaps, gingerbread, cake), and for good reason. Benjamina Ebuehi, author of The New Way to Cake, melts molasses and golden syrup with butter, stem ginger and vanilla before adding the rest of her ingredients. Her choice of icing? Caramelised white chocolate, which, she writes, “transforms it into something with much more depth. Think of a really creamy dulce de leche, and you’re not far off.”Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Ah, they were happy days … Anyway, now the problem is more likely to be that you can’t face going to the shops to buy hummus, but the solution is the same: if you’ve got the ingredients, make your own.Prep 10 min, plus soakingCook Zero to 2 hr+, depending on the chickpeasServes 4200g dried chickpeas, or 1 x 400g tin or jar (see step 1)1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda (optional)3 garlic cloves, or to taste6 tbsp tahiniJuice of 1 lemon, or more to taste1 generous pinch ground cuminFine salt, to tasteExtra-virgin olive oil, to topIf you’re using dried chickpeas, which is my preference, because I think they have a better flavour, put them in a large bowl and cover with twice the volume of cold water.If you’re using a tin, skip straight to step four – the jarred Spanish kind are pricey, but their buttery texture makes it worth it if you can run to the expense.Stir in a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda, if using, and leave to soak for 24 hours – this will help the chickpeas soften more quickly, and give the finished hummus a creamier consistency, but if you don’t have it available, or really don’t like the flavour even in small amounts, leave it out.Drain and rinse the chickpeas, put them in a large pan with the remaining bicarb and cover again with cold water. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently until tender, adding more water if necessary – this will probably take a couple of hours, depending on the age of the chickpeas they should be easy to crush, but not falling apart.Leave the chickpeas to cool in the cooking liquid, then drain well, reserving the water. If using tinned or jarred chickpeas, drain them, and likewise keep their liquid. Set aside a spoonful of the chickpeas to use as a garnish. If you’d like a really silky end product, remove the papery skins (which should be falling off by this point anyway), by rubbing the chickpeas between your fingers it’s a fiddly job, true, but I think well worth it.Peel and crush the garlic (three cloves are my preference for this amount of chickpeas, but you may wish to add more, or less, depending on your tolerance for raw garlic), and put half of it in a small bowl.Stir in the tahini and half the lemon juice, to make a stiff paste, then gradually beat in just enough of the reserved chickpea water to loosen it to a pourable liquid consistency.Put this and the drained chickpeas in a food processor (or, if you’re using a stick blender, a sturdy bowl if you don’t have either, you can use a pestle and mortar to crush the chickpeas in batches, provided you have the time and patience – though you’ll need then to press it through a sieve to get the mix to the right texture.Blitz the chickpeas until really smooth, then add the cumin, a good pinch of salt and the rest of the garlic. With the motor still running, drizzle in enough of the reserved cooking water to get the desired consistency – the hummus should hold its shape, but not be heavy or claggy. Taste and add more salt, lemon or garlic, if you think it needs it.Spoon the hummus into a serving bowl and then pour a little olive oil around the side. Finish by scattering the reserved chickpeas in the centre you could also add a sprinkle of sesame seeds, za’atar, sumac or smoked paprika, if you fancy it, or indeed some fresh herbs such as finely chopped coriander or mint.Purists may be horrified, but hummus is a very versatile base. Add pureed cooked beetroot or other vegetables (roast red peppers or squash are particularly nice), or swap some of the chickpeas for other beans or pulses, if you prefer. Homemade (or, indeed, shop-bought) hummus is the perfect home for that almost empty jar of harissa or the last handful of frozen peas, so be creative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43efe530f69fe23cc53861347ed9829f4f3db00/0_232_6960_4176/master/6960.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3f1f0170ea85e864f39f61c03161362d","title":"michelin quality food aldi prices lockdown how make most summer surplus british produce","story":"From artisan cheeses to king scallops, lockdown has left high-quality British produce looking for a home. Here’s what to do with it Coronavirus was an earthquake for British food and drink producers. With restaurants, pubs and office canteens shut, exports disrupted and Britons hoarding for lockdown, mismatches in supply chains were created, along with temporary shortages and huge gluts of surplus produce. All this meant farmers, fishermen and processors needed to find new retail opportunities.The aftershocks are still reverberating. Lockdown is easing, but British food is far from back to normal. From supermarkets selling seafood once destined for Michelin-starred restaurants to artisan cheesemakers offloading stock on waste-food apps, British producers are desperate for your support. For shoppers, there are bargains to be had. But which products are affected by surpluses? And what exciting things can you do with these ingredients?Usually sold to top restaurants, the Dorset Shellfish Company’s cockles and clams (£10.99£13.99 a kilo, respectively), which are approved by the Marine Stewardship Council, are available at 150 Waitrose fish counters. The supermarket says this offers a “lifeline” to the Poole harbour fishermen involved.Chilli-laden spaghetti alle vongole is an obvious dish for such clams, but Sai Deethwa, the owner of the Birmingham street food business Buddha Belly, recommends “clams stir-fried with roasted Thai chilli paste – AKA nam prik pao – tons of Thai basil and a little oyster sauce and water to create a liquor. It’s incredible.”At the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd, the chef-owner Si Toft loves cockles with fattier lamb cuts, such as rump: “Roast it in the pan then, while the lamb is resting, chuck the cockles through the rendered fat for two minutes with a little butter and cider, reduce it all and bang it over the lamb. It’s stunning.”Chip-shop closures left at least 95,000 tonnes of excess spuds in circulation. Versatile varieties such as Markies, Agria and Eurostar – usually described as chipping potatoes because they are bigger and uglier than their retail cousins – are circulating in Morrisons’ Wonky range and at other supermarkets. Such spuds are good for sautéing and making wedges – or what Toft describes as “the absolute king of family teas: dauphinoise layered with onions and bacon”. And the secret to perfect mash? Butter. And lots of it.“If you don’t have contracts, you don’t grow. If you stop, you don’t go back,” says Ali Capper, a hop grower at Stocks Farm in Worcestershire. “If this surplus halves prices, am I going to grow next year? No. We risk a significant proportion of hop growers leaving the industry.”The message is simple: drink more real ale made with English hops. Work it into your baking and cooking, too. “We use a half-beer base in cheese sauces,” says Sam Grainger, the executive chef at Belzan in Liverpool. “That yeasty, hoppy flavour really pushes it up.”Ordinarily, Britain eats medium and large brown eggs. Smaller and white eggs go into manufacturing, catering or fast food. But to cope with increased demand, Tesco is stocking surplus white eggs and Waitrose mixed-size boxes of 12 for 20p less than the equivalent weight of uniform eggs.With Easter and Eid celebrations quieter this year, and older shoppers who prefer it often isolating at home, lamb had a tough lockdown. Restaurants and export markets are opening, gradually, but there is a danger, particularly in September as new-season lamb comes through, of problems with so-called carcass balance – whereby lamb mince sells well, but roasting joints and other cuts are neglected. Chefs find that baffling. “Cider-braised lamb breast is amazing” – cover in foil and cook for three to four hours at 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 – “as are lamb shortribs,” says Toft.Deethwa is a big fan of lamb massaman curry: “Because it’s slightly sweet, lamb lends itself to the tamarind’s sourness – and you can slow-cook shank, neck and shoulder because it’s nice and fatty.”The Cornish Cheese Co is selling frozen 5kg bags of blue cheese – which is fine for cooking – for £25 through the food-waste app Too Good to Go, while Aldi, after buying four tonnes of surplus stock, has launched 475g mixed boxes of small-producer British cheese for £1.49. That illustrates how traumatic 2020 has been for some artisan cheese producers.At Belzan, Grainger is amazed more people are not cooking with blue cheese: “We do a delicious wild mushroom and baked eggs dish with it,” he says. “You can coat salads in blue cheese sauce blended with yoghurt – beetroot is great, as are roasted peaches baked with blue cheese and parma ham.”If you are quick, you will catch the back end of asparagus season at Waitrose, which is stocking larger, smaller, fatter, thinner and curved asparagus that, historically, it would have rejected. Toft suggests gently barbecuing it: “Dressing-wise, go burnt lemon” – char half a lemon, then mix the juice with oil and salt – “or bacon-fat hollandaise. You wazz rendered bacon fat through hollandaise instead of butter. It’s amazing on asparagus.”In what it says is “a bid to make sure homegrown produce doesn’t go to waste”, Waitrose has relaxed its rules on the blemishes and bumps that would normally result in carrots and parsnips being sold to mass-catering outlets rather than gracing its aisles.If you have an abundance of carrots, the Indian dessert halwa – 1kg of carrots to serve four(!), although it varies by recipe – is one way to deploy them. For those with less of a sweet tooth, Mayur Patel, the co-owner of the northern mini-chain Bundobust, recommends sambharo, “a kind of desi slaw, served on the side of every curry”. Temper mustard seeds, green chillies and a little asafoetida in oil. After this cools, add lemon juice and mix through shredded carrot. Let it marinade for a couple of hours before serving.From Belzan’s carrot-top pesto (200g carrot tops blended with 50g Parmesan, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, juice of one lemon, eight brown anchovies, 100ml oil and seasoning) to Buddha Belly’s som tam green papaya salad, in which carrots add “sweet, crunchy balance”, this is a versatile vegetable. But faced with a bag of wonky carrots or parsnips, many of us will think soup – so how do you make those soups sing?You need, suggests Elaine Mason, from the soup bar Union of Genius in Edinburgh, acid: “Lemon, lime, a touch of vinegar cooked off. Parsnips loves the tart sweetness apple adds. Roast them first if there’s time, but tinker with acid and spices like coriander seed, cumin and sumac.” And don’t forget garnishes: “Soy-roasted seeds on top add texture, salt and savour. Harissa-roasted chickpeas bring heat and crunch.”Supermarkets sold hundreds of thousands of discounted steaks at the peak of lockdown. With restaurant recovery patchy and markets volatile, stay alert for more beefy bargains. Grainger recommends marinating cheaper steaks in “soy, fish sauce and palm sugar to get the caramelised crust you get from expensive cuts with better fat”.Dire as such prices sound for fishermen, one major supplier, Ocean Fish, considers this moment an opportunity. (Its Cornish sardines are £5.99 a kilo at Waitrose.) “Supermarkets should play a role in backing British fish,” says a spokesperson, adding: “Selling greater volumes into supermarkets could even support the drop in market value for certain species.”Grainger soaks sardine fillets in sherry vinegar before breadcrumbing and frying them. Toft also keeps it simple with dover sole: “Barbecue it. You get a higher temperature, char and that smoky thing going.” Rub the slashed skin with oil, lemon, rosemary and salt – flavoured salt if you have something suitable. “Flavoured salts will lift any white fish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c114f178488893c75611fbe0677e63ff504454/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=24cbe707b0f369441124fe40ea804781","title":"uk fans return lockdown irish cup final glentoran ballymena","story":"Football fans will be allowed inside a stadium in the UK for the first time since lockdown when Ballymena United meet Glentoran in the Irish Cup final at Windsor Park in Belfast on Friday.Supporters have not attended matches since football was suspended in March, with games held behind closed doors as a condition of the restart in June. Hopes that the new Premier League season could start on 12 September with some fans in attendance were quashed on Monday when the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, confirmed 1 October as the target date.In Northern Ireland the easing of lockdown restrictions means 500 fans can attend Friday’s final.

Supporters of Ballymena and Glentoran, who reached the final with penalty shootout victories against Coleraine and Cliftonville respectively in semi-finals behind closed doors on Monday, will be assigned seats behind the goals.The delicate issue of who receives tickets has been decided differently by the finalists. Glentoran will distribute their allocation free of charge to players’ families, club vice-presidents, life members, life season-ticket holders and volunteers who, according to the directors, “have worked tirelessly to help the club through the recent public health emergency”. The remaining tickets went into a raffle among season ticket holders.

For once we were disagreeing. He, like many in football, thought that the temporary rule change to allow five substitutions from an extended bench of nine players favoured the big clubs. I insisted it wouldn’t.At the time it felt like the debate didn’t matter much either way, given the rule was only expected to last until the end of the season. Now, however, Ifab has agreed to extend it, to the dismay of many. Burnley’s manager, Sean Dyche, and Aston Villa’s Dean Smith are prominent critics – and one well-regarded journalist recently claimed it “really does not take the brains of Lloyd George to work out that it is a rule which will favour richer clubs who have squads packed with larger numbers of higher-quality players”. However, this issue really is not as simple as it appears on the surface. Let me explain why.My starting point is this: if being able to use five substitutes favoured the big clubs, you would expect them to make more changes compared with smaller teams. However, since the season resumed that hasn’t been the case. After lockdown was relaxed in the Bundesliga, for instance, the top four teams used 4.03 substitutes per game, while the bottom four teams used 4.59 substitutes per game. In the Premier League, Manchester City and Chelsea used fewer substitutes on average than Bournemouth and Norwich.So what is going on? My argument is that the change in the number of substitutions neither harms nor benefits the teams according to their quality, but depends on other considerations.Let me explain using a scenario I have discussed with a number of coaches, players, and analysts in the Premier League and La Liga. It is far simpler than real life, but hopefully it captures the essence of the situation.Let’s take two hypothetical situations. In Situation A, substitutions during the game are forbidden. Teams start and end the game with 11 players. In Situation B, meanwhile, it is mandatory to replace the starting XI at half-time, and no other substitutions are allowed. Going from A (“No subs”) to B (“All subs”) means going from 0 to 11 substitutions, something undoubtedly much more drastic than going from three to five substitutions.In Situation B, each team experiences a change in the quality of its players in the second half. The difference between the second half and the first half depends only on how good each team’s substitutes are relative to the starting XI.In other words, whether a given team benefits depends on how its own relative change compares with the relative change of its opponent. Note that the words “strong team” or “weak team” are not used here, and therefore whether one team has a better or worse squad than another is irrelevant.Let me put it another way. Let’s assume that every team’s first team and substitutes’ bench has a quality that is measurable and can be assigned a number from 0 to 100, with 100 being best.Now imagine a match between a strong and a weak team, in which all the players are replaced at half-time. The strong team has 11 players of quality 100 and another 11 who are 60. On the other hand, a weak team has 22 identical players, all of quality equal to 20.When the starting players have to be replaced at the break, the strong team plays with quality 100 in the first half and quality 60 in the second half, while the weak team plays with quality 20 in both halves. Contrary to what many might think, under these conditions, it is clear that the weaker team prefers the situation where there are more substitutions.Of course Team B has a low chance of winning throughout. I am not disputing that. But, crucially, their chances of winning go up when 11 changes are made. The reason is that it has a more homogeneous squad, one with more similar player quality and is able to make more like-for-like substitutions.Here is another scenario. All players in the strong team have an identical quality equal to 50, while the weak team has a quality of 20 in its first XI and of 15 in its 11 substitutes. Here again the more homogeneous team – which in this case is the strong team – benefits most from a situation where there are more substitutions allowed.These simple exercises capture the essence of the impact of rule change. A team’s strength does not matter. Squads that can make more like-for-like substitutions are the ones that will benefit most from the possibility of a greater number of substitutions, regardless of their riches and thus overall level of quality of the squad. More uneven squads suffer from the rule change, regardless of how good their overall squad is.At this point you are probably thinking: “Well, your theory sounds all well and good professor, but in practice the big clubs have more homogeneous squads than smaller ones?” I wouldn’t be so sure.There is a well-known effect in football which economists refer to as the “superstar phenomenon” – whereby a small number of people earn enormous amounts and dominate the activities in which they engage. Of course it is not specific to football or even sports. There are countless examples from the world of arts and letters and showbiz where there is a strong tendency for rewards to be highly skewed toward the most talented iniduals in the activity, with very large rewards at the top and a marked skewness in the distribution of salaries.Nearly 40 years ago, Sherwin Rosen, an economist from the University of Chicago, proposed a brilliant theory to explain these general patterns. Applied to football, it means that essentially the best players reap a greater share of payroll, and this reduces the spoils available to the relatively less gifted in the squad. The superstar phenomenon, therefore, tends to increase the salary inequality both within squads and across squads.As salaries are associated with quality and performance, this pushes richer clubs to tend to have more uneven squads than lesser – in terms of money – clubs. Richer clubs would then benefit less, not more, and tend to use fewer substitutes, which is what is happening. Of course it would make sense to go through each squad inidually to make sure this is the case.Incidentally, reports have suggested that only Aston Villa, Bournemouth and West Ham voted against the rule change. But if they have a relatively more balanced squad, they should have been among those to vote in favour.Ignacio Palacios-Huerta is professor of management at the London School of Economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04b434deb8da3d53230ccf5145f86dec3a9873e6/343_89_1469_882/master/1469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bc31fb7fcf777f5c4bf15670d956323","title":"roki review scandinavian fairytale nintendo switch pc mac polygon treehouse united label","story":"Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac Polygon TreehouseUnited LabelA girl must rescue her brother from the clutches of a mythical beast in this strikingly designed, emotionally poignant adventureThis impressively rich point-and-click adventure game from the British indie studio Polygon Treehouse sweeps players into a sprawling Scandinavian fairytale with a razor-sharp edge. The protagonist, a young girl named Tove, must navigate a strange cel-shaded landscape to rescue her mischievous brother Lars from the clutches of a mythical beast.It’s a compelling, unsettling child-abduction storyline that wouldn’t look out of place in a Scandi-noir drama. Although Röki’s snowy hills, giant lakes and cosy wood cabins may seem designed to nudge players into a state of hygge, a persistent air of menace prevents the experience from feeling too comfortable.To find her brother, you must guide Tove through a vast array of lock-and-key puzzles, digging through mounds of snow or rooting through drawers to find a particular object, which will sometimes need to be combined with another to make your way forwards. Some of these puzzles are more challenging than others: at one point you must make your way through a dense forest with only the most subtle clues as guides, and with one wrong turn sending you back to where you started. I found it all fairly easy, so long as I took time to carefully survey my surroundings. Hints were a few clicks away when I hadn’t the foggiest idea where to look, but I rarely needed them.Although Tove’s extensive scavenger hunt is repetitive, it is balanced by her honest and endearing dialogue. Themes of grief, fear and abandonment are woven so delicately into the action that progressing to the next area or challenge sometimes seems secondary to hearing Tove reveal another emotional secret or share some feeling about a family member, all of whom she has become separated from in one way or another.Tove is whip-smart and has been forced to grow up fast, but nevertheless expresses childlike wonder at her surroundings. It’s a joy to see the world through her eyes, even when that world is filled with fear.It is the striking cel-shaded design, though, that elevates Röki just above games such as Year Walk, which is similarly inspired by Scandinavian folklore. The design enhances minor artistic details – whether it’s snow glistening on a treetop or a hostile character’s imposing shadow – to create a more involving experience. Röki’s pleasing aesthetics are well-matched by an absorbing story that always keeps you on your guard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73b0abb86f85067dbaa2df9a2a0e2bb54ace4931/0_335_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8394478dab43fd2a8d80236abe4cb38","title":"measles stalks central african republic in covids shadow in pictures","story":"Photographer James Oatway of MSF witnessed the misery caused by this preventable disease, as vaccination programmes are disrupted around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ca2b34aca535690caaac5b04dc78a6b62b394c/0_320_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=acd3930be0aeb8d6fab87273746df3b0","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

Since Japan prohibits holding dual nationality, she has retained her Japanese passport in order to feel close to her family, who live in her country of birth.Sawayama said that she contemplated renouncing her Japanese citizenship in order to become eligible, until she realised that it wouldn’t “solve anything” and that she disagreed with “this definition of Britishness”.Sawayama’s label, Dirty Hit, contacted the BPI to explain her nationality situation but “received a curt response”, according to Vice’s reporting.A BPI spokesperson said: “Both the Brit awards and the Hyundai Mercury prize aim to be as inclusive as possible within their parameters, and their processes and eligibility criteria are constantly reviewed.” The organisation did not answer questions from the .Sawayama recorded her critically acclaimed debut album, SAWAYAMA, in the UK and LA and said she is registered to pay tax in the UK. In 2018, she received a grant from the BPI’s Music Export Growth Scheme, which supports British musicians and music organisations looking to market themselves overseas.She would also be ineligible for the British categories at the Brit awards, also run by the BPI, which require artists to be UK passport holders. She would be eligible for the international categories. Prestigious British songwriting awards the Ivor Novellos, on the other hand, require artists to have lived in the UK for one year to be considered eligible.Sawayama said she wanted British awards bodies to take into account artists who have indefinite leave to remain “and change the rules to what Britishness means to them. The concept of Britishness has been in the public discourse in the most negative way possible – it has become very, very narrow in these last five to six years. I think the arts are somewhere that they can reverse that and widen it up.”She said: “If arts awards are creating their own sort of version of border control around their eligibility, I think that’s really problematic.”Elton John has described SAWAYAMA as “the strongest album of the year by far”.

Each time the former kickboxing dynamo wipes away her tears, laughs a little while saying sorry, and continues. “Those moments have led me to this moment,” she says after one poignant pause, “where I now manage to not look for approval from outside. Rather, I go inwards and find strength from within.”Begum reiterates her passion for fighting and her certainty that she can still become a success in her new sport of boxing despite the odds stacked against her. “I do love it. Stepping into the ring allows you to grow because you’re putting yourself in such depths of fear. And when you overcome that there’s such a sense of accomplishment. I love that and the fact I’m constantly working towards my goal, and progressing, even if I sometimes lose.”She is a petite 36-year-old, a warm and reflective woman who also has a degree in architecture. At 5ft 3in, she does not look like a fighter. And so it’s strange, at first, to reconcile the fact that the violent backdrop of Muay Thai and boxing have brought serenity into Begum’s often turbulent world.“I think any creative art form, whether music or dance, Muay Thai or boxing, allows you to channel emotion and express yourself,” she says. “I was fortunate to have discovered Thai boxing when I had few other opportunities to express myself. I found my passion in life and realised I was good at it. But it’s like anything in life – talent is nothing without sacrifice. There needs to be hard work. There needs to be discipline and focus.“So when I had all those problems I didn’t blame others. I took responsibility and said: ‘OK, this is where I am. How do I move forward?’ I found the best way to heal myself is through sport. So I’m really grateful for having Muay Thai and now boxing in my life.”Begum’s new book, Born Fighter, provides an absorbing insight into the obstacles she faced. It is written with Sarah Shephard and the two women, from Muslim and Jewish backgrounds, complement each other as we learn how Begum hid her passion for Thai boxing from her family for many years. She was torn between her desire to be a dutiful Muslim daughter and a darker yearning to discover her real self in the ring.The KO Combat Academy, where much of the book is set, is located under an arch in a backstreet of Bethnal Green. Trains clatter overhead and it makes me think how intimidating it must have been for a teenage Bangladeshi girl to approach a gym. “The original gym was across the road,” Begum explains, “and I can’t believe I had the courage to walk in. This is now more a commercial gym whereas back then it was hardcore. It was just fighters.”Bill Judd, who trained Begum to her world championship, welcomes us today. He was just as accepting, if initially surprised, when the 18-year-old Begum told him she wanted to be a fighter. She could cover the bruises on her arms and legs, which she took from kicks, but she became adept at avoiding blows to her face. And when she was marked up her sister helped her hide the damage or she pulled her hijab more closely around her face.Five years later Begum was forced to abandon Muay Thai. She was coerced into an arranged marriage by her family – who meant well in adhering to the traditions of their culture. “I was 23 and it was overwhelming,” Begum recalls. “I thought: ‘Whoa, I need to take a breath because I don’t even know him.’ I felt so much pressure to go along with it so I tried to speak to my mum. She waved me away and was very dismissive. They made it clear this was going to happen.”Begum stresses that her husband, a banker from east London, was not a monster. Her book’s most harrowing pages detail how she felt trapped and suffocated living with her husband’s family who expected her to do so many chores on their behalf. “I was oppressed,” she says. “I didn’t have that freedom to say: ‘I’m feeling a bit tired so I’ll do the washing in an hour.’ I was constantly trying to please them but whatever I did wasn’t enough. At the same time I’d started a high-pressure job as a trainee architect. Eventually it took a toll on me.”Begum details the severe panic attacks which engulfed her after nine months. Her doctor advised her to move back to her parents. She was in a terrible state and only the eventual understanding of her parents stabilised her. What would have happened if they had insisted she return to her marriage? “I would have stood my ground and said no. But it would have been a battle to find the courage and strength – especially when I was very vulnerable. My father was in two minds. But my mum and older brother were like: ‘No, she has to go back. This is the tradition.’ I tried to explain it to my father after one of my therapy sessions. And his reaction wasn’t good. But at that point my ex-husband filed for orce and I was thinking: ‘God, it’s the biggest relief.’ My parents understood then what I had been through.“I was on antidepressants for four months and completely bedridden. But I didn’t want to be on antidepressants because they numb you. The only thing I remembered enjoying was Muay Thai and so I told myself: ‘Get back to the gym.’ One day I asked my parents to drop me off when they were coming to Whitechapel to shop. I then said: ‘Actually, can you come in with me?’ I introduced them to Bill.”The trainer outlined the discipline of the sport and stressed how Begum was so respectful, and respectable, in the gym. Her parents agreed she could return. But new problems soon emerged. Begum cries when she tells me how she was bullied by other female fighters at the gym.“It went on for five years and Bill kept saying to me: ‘Why don’t you just leave and go to another gym?’ I thought: ‘No. I don’t want to be pushed out.’ Bill hated it but his focus was on that group of girls. I wish he supported me more because I just wanted equal treatment. So it really broke my heart and that’s why I’m torn about this place. I’ve had some amazing moments here but also a lot of pain.”Begum shocked everyone in 2011 by becoming a European champion in Latvia without having anyone in her corner. A Danish trainer in the crowd ran to help her when he saw Begum was on her own between rounds.Over the next few years Judd worked more closely with Begum and helped her become a world champion kickboxer in 2016. In the week of her defining fight against Susanna Salmijärvi, her ME was so debilitating that Begum was stunned when she passed a medical to fight. “I was bed-bound the whole week so I said to Bill: ‘I’m too weak to even do a warm-up. Just put me in the ring. If anything happens, throw in the towel. But give me the first round so I have those two minutes to try and knock her out. This is an opportunity I’ll never get again.’ I had enough energy for two minutes which could define the rest of my life.”She came close to an early knockout but her opponent got up and, at the end of a brutal fight, Begum absorbed sustained punishment. She had done just enough to become world champion and, as she says now, “It was a 10-year journey and my first thought was: ‘Thank you, God.’”When she got home that night, battered but carrying her world championship belt, she woke her parents. “My dad jumped out of bed and started calling his friends,” she laughs. “That morning I’d been unwell and he didn’t speak to me. I wanted his blessing but he tried to pretend he didn’t know about the fight. I asked my mum for her blessing. She prayed and gave me a big hug. But when I got home around midnight my dad was so happy and proud.”Her parents surprised her when they did not resist her decision to accept an offer from David Haye to switch to professional boxing in 2018. It has been difficult for Begum and she has only had two bouts as a pro boxer – both against Ivanka Ivanova. The first fight was a draw and then, in June 2019, she was hurt badly and lost a decision to her Bulgarian opponent.“She didn’t hurt me in the first fight and so I was shocked the second time. There was just something unusual about her that night. When I hit her there was no reaction. That freaks me out because I’ve sparred with some boys, and good pros, in Vegas. I’ve made their noses bleed and if I hit someone there’s always some reaction. But there was nothing like that in our second fight. She was like a zombie.“It didn’t help that she elbowed me in the first 30 seconds and my eye completely closed. I was fighting with just one eye and it was very hard to measure distance. Everyone wanted me to give up afterwards but I’ve followed my gut. It’s a learning curve and the only problem with boxing is that once you lose your unbeaten record it’s meant to be over. And it’s far harder being a female boxer because there are no journeywomen. Any woman that goes into boxing is a serious fighter because they wouldn’t get signed otherwise.”The Covid crisis has made it even more difficult but Begum is convinced she will become a world champion boxer. She is in talks with promoters in the US and says: “I’m hopeful. I feel like my story is bigger than boxing and these challenges will make me a better fighter and a better person. For me it’s nothing new. I’ve already gone through so many challenges in a different sport and in my life.”Begum stands up and curls one of her fighting hands into a fist. The world outside is reeling and we have our masks at the ready before we leave the gym. But it feels right that this born fighter should stretch out her hand and bump her fist lightly against mine. “Phew, it was emotional,” she says simply as she reflects on the story of her life, “but it was good.”Born Fighter by Ruqsana Begum is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fedf9dcf71384a9d5af7402eb9d3dd8b5fce07e/0_2_2433_1460/master/2433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebce675479efaf8a8a78f341bb4c6789","title":"uk sports minister says rugby union outside elite may have to scrap scrums","story":"The sports minister Nigel Huddleston has indicated that there will have to be changes to the way recreational rugby union is played before it is allowed to return, including potentially no scrummages until after Christmas.Community rugby remains on the second stage of a six-part roadmap for a phased return, with players allowed to exercise within a small group of six players provided they maintain social distancing. However, no face-to-face contact is permitted and equipment sharing must be kept to a minimum.The RFU, which has submitted detailed proposals for community rugby to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said earlier this month that it was hoping “to have some positive news soon about the potential move to the next stage”. The game’s governing body in England has also been targeting a return to full-contact rugby for grassroots clubs by the end of the year.However, Huddleston was more cautious when asked whether recreational rugby would be back next season. “I hope so but where you’ve got full contact, there are some sports – judo, karate, other full contact sports – where there’s particular challenges,” he said. “I think inevitably there are going to be some changes. It could be broadly recognisable, but the reality is, for a temporary period of time, we’re going to have to probably see some changes.”In May, World Rugby said that doing away with reset scrums and eliminating “upright face-to-face” tackles would significantly reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. The global body also advised making a change of jerseys and headgear at half-time compulsory, banning huddles on the pitch and outlawing spitting.When it was suggested to Huddleston that there might be no scrums in recreational rugby until after Christmas, he replied: “Potentially, but we’ll have to see. It will be based on medical and other advice.”All sports governing bodies have had to submit plans for a safe return to the DCMS as well as Public Health England for approval and Huddleston said he had been impressed by the level of responsibility and awareness across the industry.“Nobody’s trying to come in with something to try and get away with something that they know is transparently not going to work,” he added. “But I think there’s a recognition that we might have to see a few changes with the full-contact issues, or where there’s that risk of respiratory challenges.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0ffaa855015e9e2f23574e33396b453bca4bc63/0_538_8068_4841/master/8068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0549b2435d2fcb94eade35aadc444d87","title":"theatre reopening oliver dowden","story":"Culture secretary says he ‘does not want to give false hope’ to ailing industry, with timescale not expected before NovemberThe culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, says it is likely to be November “at the earliest” before theatres are given a target date for reopening without social distancing.The news will cause further anguish in the UK’s beleaguered theatre industry, which has been calling for a clearer timescale for stage five of Dowden’s roadmap to reopen performance venues: permitting indoor theatres to reopen with a fuller audience. Outdoor performances with social distancing are currently allowed across England, with indoor productions for limited audience numbers permitted from next month.Talking to Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, Dowden said he “can’t give a stronger commitment” than Boris Johnson’s recent suggestion that “when we get to November we will look again at social distancing and where we are with the spread of the virus”. The risk of coronavirus remains high, said Dowden, who added: “I don’t want to give people false hope.”With the government’s job retention scheme set to end on 31 October, theatres now face a period of increased risk during winter, which will be made worse if they do not have sufficient preparation time to stage profitable pantomimes. In an article for the Evening Standard, Cameron Mackintosh wrote that “the possibility of a proper panto at Christmas is almost certainly ‘behind you’” if theatres don’t get the go ahead until November to reopen fully.Last week, introducing his London Palladium pilot experiment for reopening theatres, the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber had a message for Johnson: “Give us a date, mate!” Lloyd Webber predicted that regional theatre would be devastated without the box-office boost of a pantomime this Christmas and said that the producer Michael Harrison, co-owner of Qdos Pantomimes, which runs productions around the UK, “cannot proceed” with this year’s season if a reopening date was not announced by 1 August.Theatres around the UK continue to announce redundancy consultations, with Bristol Old Vic now anticipating that more than a third of its 60 full-time jobs could be at risk. Dowden gave details from the first funding round of the government’s £1.57bn emergency arts package on Wednesday. It will see a total of £622m distributed, with £500m delivered via Arts Council England to museums, galleries, theatres, music and comedy organisations £30m in grants via the British Film Institute to independent cinemas and £92m via the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Historic England to heritage sites."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

But, despite its huge legacy, there is still much to be done when it comes to representation on British TVThree sharp-suited black men in bow ties walk into the British National Party headquarters, eager to join the racist outfit. But first they must answer some questions. So began one sketch from The Real McCoy, the groundbreaking BBC show that, 30 years ago, brought a black British perspective to TV.“England versus West Indies in the cricket. Who do you support?” asks the recruiter. “Millwall,” replies one of the men, cleverly sidestepping the question. “England and Cameroon are playing football. Who do you support?” “England,” says one. “Why?” asks the recruiter, incredulous. “Paul Ince, Paul Parker, Des Walker …” the men reply, listing England’s black players of the era.“The joke still works,” says the show’s producer, Charlie Hanson. “Today they’d just need to walk into an English Defence League office to make the point.”But then the gag takes an unexpected turn. The black men suggest that they are more British than the white racist. “But I was here first!” he wails. “Tacitus, the Roman scribe said the first people he saw when he came to Britain were black,” replies one. “David MacRitchie the historian agreed,” says the second. “Archaeologists Gerald Macey and Godfrey Higgins came to the same conclusion and they were white,” says the third. Where does that leave me, asks the white man. “About two weeks,” says the first man, “to go back to the the Caucasus mountains where you were naked and covered in hair.” They slam the door on him.It has been 25 years since The Real McCoy was on our screens, which, given how many times Dad’s Army has been broadcast in the interim, is disappointing. One of the show’s stars, Felix Dexter, once said that the Beeb appeared to give “no recognition that the show ever existed”. How sad that he died before the BBC decided to put up all five series on iPlayer from this week. “It’s been a long time coming,” says his fellow star Judith Jacob. “If I had a pound for every time I’ve been asked when it’s coming back, I wouldn’t be talking to you. They said they’d lost the tapes. And then they turned up. Strange that.”Jacob, who had already starred in Channel 4’s black sitcom No Problem! and as health visitor Carmel Roberts in EastEnders before being asked to appear in the show, recalls The Real McCoy fondly. “I just remember how we would perform a sketch and if it made us laugh, it was in. If not, out. Simple economics.” The show was performed before a live studio audience, and Jacob says the crowds laughed so much that often they would have to do as many as five takes.In one sketch set in a 17th-century west African village, Jacob played a woman listening as an elder read to a crowd from a flyer nailed up by an English soldier, inviting villagers on an adventure of a lifetime across the ocean, with free travel, board and lodging on arrival. The other villagers are excited, but Jacob says: “There must be some catch.” She’s right. Turning over the flyer, there is a sketch of the accommodation – a slave ship.Words are certainly cheap: when Greg Dyke took over from John Birt as director general of the BBC in 2000, he criticised it for being “hideously white’” because of the scarcity of black and Asian people working within it. But despite that indictment, arguably, it remained so. Indeed, a decade ago, the comedian Stephen K Amos suggested that black comedy on TV was rationed. “It’s one in, one out,” he said.Why did black and Asian shows fail to build on The Real McCoy? Some have cited the critical and ratings failure of The Crouches, the BBC sitcom starring a black cast that ran between 2003 and 05. Standup Angie Le Mar told the  that after the Crouches flopped “the BBC pulled back and said: ‘We can’t do black sitcoms.’ That’s too much pressure. Why do we always have to be fantastic, or die?”Hanson has another explanation. After The Real McCoy ended, TV became more culturally conservative. For a while, Channel 4 became a reliable source of black and ethnic minority comic talent. Hanson produced Desmond’s (1989-94), starring Norman Beaton, and the fledgling channel was also responsible for Get Up, Stand Up (1994-99), a black standup show. Many of these programme were commissioned by Farrukh Dhondy when he served as commissioning editor for multicultural programming. But that post no longer exists and C4’s radical remit is long dead. It was a similar story at the London network LWT, where erse commissioning decreased in the wake of ITV’s re-formation. As for the BBC, its problem with commissioning and representing black and Asian talent was typified by how The Real McCoy originated. One day in 1990, Hanson says he was summoned to meet the BBC’s head of comedy Robin Nash: “He realised that the BBC was not fulfilling its ersity remit and something had to be done.” Hanson had worked with the the Black Theatre Co-Operative and produced comedy gigs in south London, working with many of the comedy talents who would appear on the show, including Curtis and Ishmael, Robbie Gee and Leo Chester (AKA Leo Muhammad), so he was a good person to call in. But there was something wrong with this picture: a white executive was commissioning a white producer to remedy the problem of black underrepresentation.“It’s still the same,” says Jacob when I put this to her. She is thrilled to see The Real McCoy back on screens, but her joy is tempered by the fact that it never revolutionised British TV as she hoped. True, The Real McCoy now has a belated successor in Famalam (whose cast acknowledge the debt to Jacob and her peers), but that has taken nearly a quarter of a century. She thinks Sarpong and her BBC colleagues have their work cut out to improve black and Asian representation, not just on screen but behind it, from commissioning editors to makeup artists.Today, the best non-white British comedy talent is often found not in theatres or comedy clubs but online. Think how the Coventry schoolteacher and successful YouTuber Guz Khan was signed up by the BBC to make Man Like Mobeen. Or how Kayode Ewumi made a hit webseries called #HoodDocumentary, which was picked up in 2016 by the BBC who commissioned him to make the excellent sitcom Enterprice two years later.The Real McCoy benefited from being given a prime-time slot on the schedules when it premiered at 9pm on BBC Two in May 1991 and garnered regular audiences of 5 million, many of them white. “It wasn’t just for black or Asian people,” says Jacob. “Funny isn’t black or white. I watched Dad’s Army, at 10,000 levels it has nothing to do with me, but I laugh at it.”While the Real McCoy’s political gags – on slavery, racism and multicultural incomprehension – are as depressingly pertinent today as they were in the early 1990s, what also makes it essential viewing, whatever your ethnicity, is that it remains funny. I love Dexter as Nathaniel the bumptious trainee accountant from Lagos, rudely schooling West Indians in the audience how to speak proper English. “What I have noticed,” he says, waving a cane, “is that if there is an aitch in front of the vowel you are taking it away. And if there isn’t one, you are putting it in. For example: ‘My friend Harchibald is in ’ospital. They are keeping ’im in hovernight.’” Or the peerless Llewella Gideon as Miss Hortense Pretentious, the black Margaret Thatcher clone running as a Tory candidate. “Britain is for the English,” she tells the party conference chillingly to rapturous applause, “and so we need to keep the foreigners out.” Or Misery’s West Indian restaurant, where the only thing on the menu is abuse from the surly staff. It’s been too long: how lovely that they are back.The Real McCoy is available on iPlayer now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f645fbde50c4b27a235f7edf1b75c0e4c783cd38/0_27_2616_1569/master/2616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cd86d5d03110b5c2e95f27e7d0fd7bbe","title":"texas hidalgo county border mexico coronavirus","story":"Hundreds have died in Hidalgo county, on the Mexican border – but the governor has thwarted efforts to go back into lockdownSeventy-two death notices sprawled across an entire page of the Monitor newspaper in Hidalgo county recently.The small-print entries, stacked in five tidy columns, didn’t mention Covid-19. But 27 residents of the south Texas community had died from the virus that day, 22 the day before, and 35 the day before that.“I’ve never seen that ever in my life,” recalled John M Kreidler, a local funeral director, whose family has run Kreidler Funeral Home in McAllen for over a century.Hand-sanitizing machines and big bins with masks and gloves surround shoppers at the regional grocery store. Outside of Nomad Shrine Club, a rundown event space turned drive-thru pop-up, residents join a long line of people in cars in search of a Covid-19 test with rapid results. Even Tex Mex, a gentlemen’s club, has a somber message for patrons: “Clothed Again.”“The Rio Grande Valley has become the hotspot of a hotspot of a hotspot,” said Ivan Melendez, Hidalgo county’s health authority and a practicing clinician. “We’re at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the United States.”In the United States, where the prevailing mantra for physicians is “do no harm”, that kind of ruthless calculation strikes deep, especially when so many of the lives at stake are medically vulnerable and easily exploited.In Hidalgo county – “a poor, fat, diabetic population”, Melendez said bluntly – nearly one in three people under age 65 lack health insurance. Thirty percent live in poverty, and a 2020 WalletHub report found that three local cities hold the distinction as the “fattest” metropolitan area in the nation.Hidalgo county also sits along the US-Mexico border, and an estimated 102,000 unauthorized immigrants who may be afraid to seek care exist within its margins. Large families serve as an ideal vector for the virus, as do those who still flock to beaches and flea markets on weekends.Already, 467 members of the community have died from Covid-19, according to the county, most of them since Texas reopened in May. But the state government has actively thwarted efforts to go back into lockdown, prioritizing economic vitality even as the death toll skyrockets.Leonardo Tremari worries about going to his job inside a Walmart supercenter in McAllen, but he – and countless other employees – still have to work. “I don’t have a choice,” he told the , laughing tensely.Last week, Hidalgo county judge Richard F Cortez ordered residents to stay home and encouraged non-essential businesses to limit their services. But a spokesperson for Texas governor Greg Abbott quickly undermined Cortez’s authority, saying it was “simply a recommendation”. The dizzying policy ping-pong is an extension of a larger politicization of the pandemic nationwide during an election year, where just suggesting wearing a face mask has become a partisan dog whistle.Some people in Hidalgo county remain convinced that the current health crisis is made up or overblown, despite the fact that by now, everyone is at most a few degrees of separation from someone who has suffered or died because of Covid-19, Melendez said. More than 15,000 people have tested positive in the county, and last week, hospitals teemed with over a thousand patients stricken by the virus.In a matter of weeks, Melendez has put his sixth-grade teacher on life support, opened up a body bag to play a son’s farewell video for a patient who had already died, and stumbled upon a gravely ill nurse he’d known for 30 years, whom he didn’t even recognize at first glance. Harrowing personal moments abound, as do thorny gray areas.“There’s a moral, ethical dilemma at every place that we turn,” he said.Hospital emergency departments are struggling to cope, so other wings have morphed into Covid units – even when they aren’t equipped to do so. One health care worker at DHR Health in Edinburg, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described patients in hallways, two people to a room and “everything askew at all times” in a rehabilitation facility that has been converted amid the health emergency. The building isn’t made to provide so much life-sustaining oxygen, they said, and one time, it simply shut off.“Everybody here who is a healthcare professional feels very powerless,” they said. “We’re just trying to help do what we can with the horrible resources we’ve been given.”But anxious locals seek out diagnoses anyway. At Nomad Shrine Club, where results take minutes instead of days, members of the public arrive as early as 2 or 3am just to nab one of 300 daily tickets available for a test. A few blocks down the road, another, competing tent operation fielded so much demand that it rented out a larger parking lot.Both testing services charge fees, either $75 or $125. Neither takes insurance.Most patients just say they’re feeling down, said Genesis Gonzalez, a medical assistant who works at the tent. “Next thing you know, they come back positive.”As Gonzalez baked under the Texas sun, she wore short-sleeved scrubs and a mask, her hair tied back neatly. She and her colleagues have access to more comprehensive protective gear, she said, but some of them get dizzy or faint if they wear it in 101-degree weather.“I tell ’em, you know, ‘I have no idea what your loss feels like, and I’m so incredibly sorry for that loss,’” Garza said. “But I’m proud of them for coming themselves to get tested so that they won’t go out and expose other people. That’s really hard to do.”At Kreidler’s funeral home, corpses wrapped in sheets, then double-bagged and wrapped again lay across tables in the preparation room because there’s no space left in the cooler. The crematory is fully booked up to 10 days in advance.Kreidler and his staff, including his wife and son, sometimes work into the night without much sleep or regular meals. They’re constantly in a rush, and every time a body leaves, it just means another spot has opened up.“We’re wanting the pandemic to go away,” said the weary funeral director, who’s fed up with how the crisis has been manipulated as a “political football”.“We need to get this stopped – and stopped now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dc906a3f58a5b67c14d81df97067aa91dc99504/0_182_5362_3217/master/5362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3ff143343edbc02be69210589147a1f","title":"coronavirus uk signs deal for 60m doses potential vaccine","story":"GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur could supply vaccine by early next year if it is successfulThe UK has secured a deal for 60m doses of a fifth potential Covid-19 vaccine, positioning itself as one of the leaders in the global race to ensure vaccine supplies with a total of 250m doses secured so far.In the worldwide scramble, which has been criticised by campaigners who warn vaccine nationalism will cause billions of people in poorer countries to lose out, the UK, the US and EU are in effect securing their own supplies. Wealthy countries are able to take a gamble, signing deals for vaccines that may not work.The latest contract signed by the UK is with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and its French partner, Sanofi Pasteur, for 60m doses of the Covid-19 vaccine they are developing. It already has deals for 100m doses of the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine and for 90m doses of two others.The hope is that the UK could begin to vaccinate priority groups, such as frontline health and social care workers and those at increased risk from coronavirus, as early as the first half of next year, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.Human clinical studies of the GSKSanofi vaccine will begin in September followed by a phase 3 study in December. The vaccine is not as far ahead in the development porcess as that being worked on at Oxford University, which is already in large-scale human trials in Brazil and the US, where there are many more infections than in Europe.The Covid-19 vaccines in development fall into roughly four different groups, according to the technologies on which they are based. The government strategy is to buy several vaccines from each group, Kate Bingham, the chair of the government’s vaccine taskforce, has said.The government accepts it could lose money on some. If all of them work, “we will be the vaccine supplier to the world”, she said, “but the likelihood is most of these will fail”. The intention was to buy up to 12 vaccines.The US is intent on ensuring access for its citizens to the first available vaccines and its “America-first” policy will prohibit US companies from supplying them elsewhere in the world until its needs are met. There were promising trial results recently from Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has begun large-scale phase 3 vaccine trials.The EU is working as a bloc to buy vaccines that are not produced in the US. The commission has secured a deal with AstraZeneca for 400m doses of the Oxford vaccine and is looking to invest in at least five others.The UK business secretary, Alok Sharma, said: “Our scientists and researchers are racing to find a safe and effective vaccine at a speed and scale never seen before. While this progress is truly remarkable, the fact remains that there are no guarantees.“In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a erse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works so we can protect the public and save lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7593d0557c2c4c9f49734d290c078be7046979a/0_24_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a418691afaa9ead5f4dd8ee979323cff","title":"global report downsized hajj pilgrimage begins amid covid 19 restrictions","story":"US deaths near 150,000 half of people living in Mumbai slums have had the coronavirus China records 100 new casesMuslim pilgrims have begun the annual hajj in the holy city of Mecca in a dramatically downsized version as the hosts, Saudi Arabia, try to prevent any outbreaks of coronavirus during the five-day pilgrimage.The hajj, one of the five pillars or most important practices of Islam and an obligation for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime, is usually one of the world’s largest religious gatherings as around 2.5 million people descend on the city from all over the world.But this year attendance is being limited to 10,000 people already residing in the kingdom as the authorities seek to control Covid-19. The disease has already infected more than 270,000 people in Saudi Arabia, placing it in the top 20 worst-affected countries.Pilgrims will be required to wear masks and observe social distancing during a series of religious rites that are completed over five days in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia.Those selected to take part in the hajj were subject to temperature checks and placed in quarantine as they began trickling into Mecca at the weekend.State media showed health workers sanitising their luggage, and some pilgrims reported being given electronic wristbands to allow authorities to monitor their whereabouts.There have now been 16.67 million cases of coronavirus around the world and more than 659,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US has the world’s most serious outbreak, with almost 150,000 deaths and 4.3 million cases.The US president, Donald Trump, halted his daily White House briefing abruptly on Tuesday night after being questioned about why he described as “spectacular” a doctor who wrongly dismissed the use of face masks to combat the coronavirus. The doctor also reportedly claimed that alien DNA is used in medical treatments and some gynaecological problems are caused by people dreaming about having sex with demons.Florida, the third most populous state in the US, has reported another record one-day rise in coronavirus deaths. The state health department said 191 people died from the disease in the 24 hours to Tuesday evening.Cases in Texas passed the 400,000 mark, fuelling fears that the United States is still not taking control of the outbreak and adding pressure on Congress to pass another massive economic aid package.China reported 101 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for 28 July, the highest in over three and a half months, the health commission said on Wednesday. China has moved quickly to stem outbreaks by contact tracing and reimposing restrictions in affected areas. Recently many of the new infections are reported to have come from the far western region of Xinjiang, where 89 have been tallied for 28 July. One was recorded in Beijing, while three were imported cases, according to a statement by the National Health Commission.In Australia, the state of Victoria recorded 295 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, down 89 from Tuesday’s figure of 384, which in turn was 150 fewer than were recorded in the record high numbers on Monday. Nine more people have died, which is close to the national record 10 deaths reported in the state one day last week. There were 19 new cases in New South Wales state, prompting neighbouring Queensland to close its border to anyone from Sydney.New Zealand recorded two new cases of Covid-19, both diagnosed in returning travellers to the country who are quarantined in managed isolation facilities. That is the case for all of New Zealand’s 23 active cases of the coronavirus – there is no known community transmission. The government also said it would start charging some travellers for the cost of their two-week stay in quarantine.Doctors have warned that the Pacific region faces a wider health crisis as its already fragile health systems are forced to take resources away from treating diseases such as tuberculosis and HIVAids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a596ffb8c48b5acb1633affc47f4ab6961de3ab1/0_104_3983_2390/master/3983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d4eb350179318c571d4efbad510b5e6","title":"half of mumbais slum residents have had coronavirus study","story":"India is the third-worst hit country in the world, but there are concerns a lack of testing could mean the true figure is far higherOver half the people living in the slums of Mumbai have had the coronavirus, according to a city-commissioned study that raises fresh doubts about India’s official case numbers.India is already the third-worst hit country after the US and Brazil, with nearly 1.5 million cases, though experts have previously said the lack of testing could mean the true tally is much higher.The city of 20 million people is home to India’s largest slum, Dharavi, where an estimated million people live. But deaths in the sprawling slum have not exploded, with local officials saying their aggressive efforts to stem the spread of the virus has been effective.The survey results suggested asymptomatic infections were “likely to be a high proportion of all infections” and also indicated the virus death rate was likely to be “very low”, the study said.The Mumbai survey came a week after an antibody study commissioned by the government suggested that almost a quarter of people in the capital New Delhi, home to 20 million people, have had the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e243f3ffe6b89b7b01ed998dd68242d61e22fb16/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0d74c28a94c02b945c03f4035414d1d","title":"iran arms sales us struggles to win support for extension of un ban","story":"European nations fear extension of arms sale ban would result in Iran leaving 2015 nuclear dealThe US may be forced to accept a UN code of conduct restricting conventional arms sales to Iran, since it is struggling to win unanimous support at the UN security council for a formal extension of the existing UN ban, which expires in October.European nations fear a formal extension of the ban would result in Iran leaving the nuclear deal.The three European signatories to the nuclear deal – Germany, France and the UK – are caught in a vice in that they do not wish to see the resumption of conventional arms sales to Tehran, but unlike the US, they do want to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive. The Europeans are especially conscious of the fact that a Democratic win in November’s election would probably lead to the US rejoining the deal, and more positive relations between Tehran and the west.Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iran, was in London on Wednesday to meet Foreign Office officials as part of his attempt to drum up support for the US policy of extending the arms embargo. He said the US would be publishing its draft resolution to put to the UN security council soon.It is likely that the US resolution to extend the arms embargo will be vetoed by either Russia or China, forcing it to look for a compromise. China in particular is in the midst of negotiating a closer relationship with Iran.At a briefing on Wednesday, Hook ruled out an EU offer to extend its own arms embargo as sufficient, since the EU embargo would still allow Iran to purchase arms outside the EU and the US. The E3’s arms embargo does not expire until 2023.“It’s great that Europe has these sanctions in place, but what we need is a global embargo, and if you do not have a global embargo it allows Iran to purchase these weapons,” said Hook, who has led the US campaign to isolate Iran. “The question in front of the international community is not whether the international arms embargo should be extended, but how and when.”He declined to rule out a code of conduct mechanism, saying it was for others to make the proposal. The code’s enforceability would be a major sticking point.Hook said the UN had supported an arms embargo on Iran for 13 years and that no leader had told him that they believed the embargo should be allowed to expire. “Nobody believes that Iran should be able to buy or sell conventional weapons like fighter jets, battle tanks, large calibre artillery systems, warships and various kinds of missiles,” he said.“Iran would like to see endless war on Saudi Arabia’s southern flank in Yemen”, he claimed, pointing out that the UN’s own panel of experts had found that weapons fired on Saudi oil installations last September were of Iranian origin. “Imagine what the region would look like if the arms embargo expires,” he said.He claimed US troops would be targeted by Iran and its proxies throughout Bahrain, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, adding: “freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf will be under even great threat”.“If the embargo is lifted Iran will start to do what it does in secret in broad daylight”, he claimed, adding that “if Israelis and Arabs are speaking on this issue with one voice, maybe the world should listen”.Hook has travelled across the Middle East and Europe to drum up support at the UN security council.Hook defended the US policy of collapsing the Iranian oil industry and leaving the nuclear deal, describing the deal as “a temporary and modest non proliferation agreement that has no legal standing at the UN or with the US”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/543869c3ba17659539e089ac7c15bf9e710d613f/0_152_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab71441c2c93abe3bedfeb851f8e3456","title":"one big wave why the covid 19 second wave may not exist coronavirus","story":"With no evidence of seasonal variations, the WHO warns the initial coronavirus pandemic is continuing and acceleratingThe Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the World Health Organization has warned.Amid continued debates over what constitutes a second wave, a resurgence or seasonal return of the disease, Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson, insisted that these discussions are not a helpful way to understand the spread of the disease.“People are still thinking about seasons. What we all need to get our heads around is this is a new virus and this one is behaving differently,” Harris told a virtual briefing in Geneva, urging vigilance in applying measures to slow transmission that appears to be accelerated by mass gatherings.She also warned against thinking in terms of virus waves, saying: “It’s going to be one big wave. It’s going to go up and down a bit. The best thing is to flatten it and turn it into just something lapping at your feet.”The reality is that the issue of second waves has been a contentious one, much talked about by politicians – including Boris Johnson – and the media, but often very ill-defined.With no agreed-upon scientific definition, the term “second wave” has been used to mean anything from localised spikes in infection to full-blown national crises, leading some experts to avoid it.Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control, is among those arguing that the concept is unhelpful for “implying that Covid-19 will act as the flu acts”.Complicating the issue is perspective. Seen from a global viewpoint – such as that of the WHO – the pandemic appears as a single, large and still-accelerating outbreak, with worldwide numbers doubling in the past six weeks.In terms of regional spread and even within inidual countries, from a ground-level view, it becomes more complicated.What can appear like a second wave is sometimes different areas of the same country simply being out of phase with each other in experiencing the epidemic, as in the US where a strong but uneven first wave moved initially in fits and starts and then more quickly.Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said that it has become a “media term”, as well as a scientific one.As Melissa Hawkins, a professor of health at American University, wrote in the Conversation, looking at the US situation, talking about second waves in countries where the disease has simply progressed unevenly is inappropriate.“The US as a whole is not in a second wave because the first wave never really stopped. The virus is simply spreading into new populations or resurging in places that let down their guard too soon,” she wrote, a comment applicable to other countries that have seen resurgences.As the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, which examined 10 epidemics of respiratory disease from 1889, points out: “Most of our thinking on second-wave theory arises from the 1918-20 Spanish flu that infected 500 million people worldwide and reportedly killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million.”“‘Waves’ imply a lack of viral circulation which is probably an illusion,” wrote Tom Jefferson and Carl Heneghan early in the outbreak in the UK.“Waves are also visible and mostly rhythmical. There does not appear to be any pattern or rhythm to the epidemics summarised in the table and their comings and going are only visible because of the effects on the human body and their impact on society.”The disease has little respect for land borders, even when authorities have tried to seal them perhaps the only country that appears to have entirely stamped out the disease is New Zealand, an island nation that has curtailed almost all inbound travel.More important than the description of any rise in cases is public health management of the increase, Neal added, and he cautioned that identifying a true second wave may need the perspective of time.“The WHO is looking at world figures and these are still increasing so as a pandemic we are in the first wave.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e890cb2689be785c1a094f5fb1c66e9ebd3b9d16/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c475b5de7184a621cd84b6cff62d4568","title":"seth rogen israel palestinians jewish actor","story":"Actor says when he was younger he wasn’t told Palestinians lived on land that became the Jewish stateSeth Rogen has said he was “fed a huge amount of lies about Israel” as a young Jewish person, stoking controversy around the country’s sometimes fraught relationship with many North American Jews.The Canadian-US actor, who attended Jewish camp and whose parents met on a kibbutz in Israel, said the fact that the Jewish state was created on land where Palestinians were living had always been omitted.“They never tell you that, ‘Oh, by the way, there were people there’. They make it seem like it was just like sitting there, like the fucking door’s open.”More than 700,000 Palestinians were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. Today, those families and their descendants make up around 5.6 million refugees.Rogen and Maron, who is also Jewish, were speaking to promote Rogen’s new comedy, An American Pickle, which tells the story of a Jewish immigrant from the 1920s who falls into a vat of brine and wakes up in modern-day Brooklyn.The pair talked and joked at length about Israel and also spoke about antisemitism, which Rogen said remains pervasive and prevalent.“I remember my dad frankly telling me, ‘People hate Jews. Just be aware of that. They just do.’ And it’s honestly something that I am so glad was instilled in me from a young age. Because if it wasn’t, I would constantly be shocked at how much motherfuckers hate Jews.”Zionists have pointed to the Holocaust and centuries of bloody antisemitism as evidence that Jews will never be safe without a state. Rogen, however, argued, “you don’t keep something you’re trying to preserve all in one place”.Asked if he would ever go to live in Israel, Rogen said no. Maron replied: “I’m the same way, and we’re gonna piss off a bunch of Jews.”Lahav Harkov, a senior contributing editor to the Jerusalem Post newspaper, criticised Rogen’s comments on Twitter, saying they were “made from a position of really, really great privilege – and ignorance - if he can’t understand why Israel makes sense to millions of Jews around the world”.Among Zionists, there is anxiety that North American Jews, who could possibly outnumber Israeli Jews, are becoming less supportive of the Jewish state, even as surveys often show the opposite.The debate has frequently reignited after high-profile figures, often Jewish, express views that are highly critical of Israel.Most recently, Peter Beinart, a prominent Jewish American political commentator, was both derided and lauded for commentaries in which he questioned whether he could remain both a liberal and also support the Jewish state while millions of Palestinians continued to be denied basic rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5783571682f008ed5e337d8e863946e6593fd0eb/0_273_4655_2794/master/4655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f59b8004b862b4eedaa5b8f481df5e2c","title":"vietnam on high alert coronavirus cases major cities hanoi","story":"First local case in three months reported over the weekend in holiday spot of Da NangVietnam is on high alert and bracing for a rise in coronavirus cases, after local media reported that infections have been detected in the capital, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands region.The country’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phu warned on Wednesday that every province and every city was at risk, adding that the new “wave” appeared to be different to that seen in Vietnam earlier this year.Vietnam, which has been praised for its response to the pandemic, reported its first local case for more than three months last weekend, after a man in the central city of Da Nang became ill. Officials have said that the recent infections involve a new strain of the virus that has originated outside of the country, and which seemed to be more virulent.So far, 30 cases of the virus have been detected in or around Da Nang, while two cases have been confirmed in Ho Chi Minh City, and one has been reported in both Hanoi and Central Highlands. There are growing fears that tens of thousands of people holidaying in the coastal city of Da Nang may have transported the virus across the country over recent weeks.“We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak,” the state broadcaster VTV reported Phu as telling a meeting of government officials. He said tourist hubs throughout the country should increase vigilance.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The government is evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, mostly tourists who had been taking advantage of discounted travel deals, who will be required to isolate at home. The city has been placed under strict lockdown, with flights suspended.VTV reported that the cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were linked to the cluster in Da Nang.Life in Vietnam had been returning to normal, with many people no longer wearing face masks and domestic tourism booming, but the country is again on high alert. In Hanoi, authorities are tracing people who may have had close contact with a man who works in a pizza restaurant and who is suspected of having Covid-19. Barriers have been placed near to the man’s home, while the restaurant and local area have been disinfected.In Ho Chi Minh City, a hotel has been locked down and a nearby hospital in Binh Tan district has stopped receiving patients for three days, after two suspected Covid-19 cases emerged.About 18,000 tourists who had been in Da Nang have returned to Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Tuesday. Hanoi authorities had earlier said they were expecting 15,000 to 20,000 to return from the city.The country responded with speed and agility to the pandemic earlier this year, deploying aggressive contact-tracing systems and quarantine measures – avoiding a major outbreak. Despite sharing a border with China, Vietnam has recorded 446 450 Covid-19 cases, and no fatalities.This figure does not include 140 construction workers infected with Covid-19 who were evacuated from Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday, and who will be treated at a hospital outside Hanoi.The source of the new cases is not clear, though the government has responded with a series of arrests linked to illegal immigration.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe Dublin City Council is investigating the decision by the Shelbourne Hotel to remove four statues from its facade, apparently without planning permission. The statues of two Nubian princesses and two slave girls were removed by the hotel on Monday. Hotel management said they took the decision in light of world events and the black lives matter movement which has called attention to the legacy of slavery around the world. In a statement Dublin City Council said it was “not aware of permission being granted to remove the statues concerned. “The matter is under investigation by the planning enforcement section and therefore no further comment can be made on the matter at this time.” The Irish Georgian Society said it had lodged a complaint with the council about the removal of the statues. It tweeted on Tuesday night: “Further to reports and in the interests of clarity, the IGS was not consulted about the removal of statues from The Shelbourne Hotel. “Such works require planning permission which we believe was not sought. The IGS has contacted DCC planning urging them to address the matter.” Dublin City Councillor Deirdre Conroy said the removal of the statues was a breach of Part Four of the Planning Development Act 2000. Cllr Conroy, who is an architect and a conservationist, has written to the planning executive and the conservation officer in the council about the removal. She said the facade of the Shelbourne Hotel including its statues are a listed structure and therefore cannot be amended without permission from the council. She said many householders are being refused planning permission to remove railings from outside their homes. “Dublin City Council would not allow a 19th century pedestrian gate to be changed. The idea that the Shelbourne Hotel on St Stephen’s Green would be allowed to do that is just ridiculous really,” she said. Cllr Conroy said under Section 57 (2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 the owner of a protected structure such as the facade of the Shelbourne Hotel has to make a written request to the planning authority for an exemption application. “It would take three months at least for the conservation application department to make an assessment of a Section 57 application.” Green Party MEP Ciaran Cuffe, who is also an architect, said a period of public consultation should have taken place before such a “significant step” was taken.

Photograph: Wikimedia Commons The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin has taken down four statues which have stood outside it for the last 153 years because of their associations with slavery.The four bronze statues were commissioned by the Shelbourne Hotel’s owner in 1867 when the celebrated facade was erected.They depict two Nubian princesses from the lower Nile and their slave girls holding torches.Nubia was for a long time a rival kingdom to Ancient Egypt before it was conquered by the Egyptians and its art was an important influence in the 19th century.The princess statues had hieroglyphics down the front of them.The statues were cast in bronze and commissioned from the studios of MM Barbezat of Paris.The Shelbourne Hotel, which has been situated on St Stephen’s Green since 1824, removed them on Monday in line with the decision by other bodies and local authorities to remove statues relating to the slave trade.The hotel’s general manager JP Kavanagh said the decision to take the four statues down had been taken by them alone and there had been no complaints from outsiders about them.“It was a decision taken just by us with our owner and operator. This decision has been coming for a number of weeks given what has been happening in the world,” he said.“When we restored the facade in 2015 and 2016, we consulted with Irish Heritage and the Irish Georgian Society.“What comes next I don’t know at this stage, but we will work with the relevant authorities.”Mr Kavanagh said there was a possibility that some or all of the statues might be restored to their old plinths but “right now” that is not an option and they hoped to work with Irish Heritage to replace them. “We will share further information in due course,” he added.The five-star hotel underwent a €40 million renovation programme between 2005 and 2007 and was closed for 18 months. It celebrated 195 years in business last year.It was acquired by the global real estate company Kennedy Wilson in 2014 and two year later it completed a significant refurbishment of the exterior facade that later won the Irish Georgian Society’s top award. However, there was no attempt to remove the statues at that stage.However the Irish Georgian Society on Tuesday raised the question about the need for planning permission to remove the statues. It said “in the interests of clarity, the IGS was not consulted about the removal of statues from The Shelbourne Hotel”.Green Party MEP for Dublin Ciaran Cuffe called for a period of public consultation about the statues.

Photograph Nick BradshawStatues of Nubian princesses and their slave girls which have been removed from outside the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin were erected at a time when Egyptology was in vogue around the world, a historian has said.John Ducie, a tour guide and former vice-chairman of An Taisce, said the story of the princess captured by the Egyptians was the inspiration for countless books, statues and most famously of all Verdi’s opera, Aida, which premiered in 1871 but had been in preparation for years beforehand.The captured Nubian princess who became queen of Egypt when the pharoah fell in love with her was known to people in 19th century society when Egyptologists learned to translate hieroglyphics.“The story itself is from the 1850s. Verdi’s opera is just the best known of a series of playwrights and operatic composers from that period who used the story. It was used over and over again,” Mr Ducie explained.The four statues were erected at the front of the Shelbourne in 1867 and have been there since, until their removal on Monday.They depict two Nubian princesses from Nubia in modern-day Sudan and their shackled slave girls. The pieces were commissioned from the MM Barbezat studios in Paris.The hotel’s general manager, JP Kavanagh, said they were removed because of the Black Lives Matter movement and the legacy of slavery.Mr Ducie said at the time the statues were erected that the Suez Canal was being built and interest in Egypt was at a peak. It was the largest construction project in history opening up a passage to India and the Far East. It was eventually completed in 1869.The introduction of the steam ship made Egypt accessible to wealthy tourists and archaeologists.High fashion“Everything Egyptian was the highest of high fashion at the time,” he said. “You will find these statues all over the place. People put them in their homes. Everything Egyptian was so chic – especially the French take on it.”Earlsfort Terrace, where the National Concert Hall is now located, staged an international exhibition in 1865 which attracted a million visitors. One of its most popular exhibits was the French pavilion, which showcased recently-recovered artefacts from Egypt. The statues were inspired by the exhibition.“It’s French, it’s Italian, it’s sophistication, it’s opera. It’s everything that the proprietors of the Shelbourne Hotel wanted to portray themselves as. That’s what these statues are all about,” Mr Ducie explained.“It has absolutely nothing to do with the Atlantic slave trade, which Ireland was heavily involved in. If you want monuments to that, just look at the City Hall. That’s a different story to what is going on in America today. These statues have nothing whatsoever to do with Black Lives Matter.”Mr Ducie said the decision to remove the statue was done by somebody who had done “very little research, doesn’t understand their art history and decided on a whim to do it.“Even a little bit of intelligent googling or consulting somebody who knew the story would make for a better informed decision.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316564.1596033435!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pup u turn government changes mind and says people on pandemic payments can travel","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin says that the Government is committed to helping and supporting people after it was announced that anyone travelling to green list countries can still receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government has changed its mind and said those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment will not have this payment docked if they travel to a green list country. Photograph: Collins Recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) who travel to green list countries will still receive the payment Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys has told the Dáil.Ms Humphreys admitted her department could have communicated more effectively and said that the cases of all those who travelled abroad for holidays would be reviewed.In a statement during Dáil question time she told TDs she had asked “people who wish to travel on any of the countries on the green list can do so and continue to receive their payment”.But she said people who travel to the countries not on the green list can only do so for “essential reasons”.She pointed out that of the 2,500 people whose payments have been stopped, 90 per cent were leaving the country permanently.However, later in the Dáil Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald appeared unaware of Ms Humphreys’s statement.Ms McDonald said that if the Government was going to penalise people for travelling abroad then it should be a punishment that was universal and not just for people on social welfare.She said “it seems to me that you acted outside the law”.Mr Martin said the Sinn Féin leader “loves throwing accusation” as he defended the Government’s approach to the pandemic payment.Rise TD Paul Murphy said the situation was “a shambles”. He referred to the statement by Ms Humphreys and said it appeared to be “at least a partial U-turn on the policy and leaves PUP recipients wondering has the discrimination being ended” and if that money would be reinstated.But the Taoiseach had just spent five minutes “speechifying” about everything other than the payment. “Can you please provide clarity” he asked Mr Martin.The Taoiseach said “the assertion of shambles is wrong”. Mr Martin said he was not responsible for operational decisions and that people on the ground had responsibility for social protection. The Taoiseach added he had said there should be a review of cases of people whose payments had been cut.Controversy erupted after it emerged at the weekend that recipients of the €350 emergency payment were having the benefit docked for overseas travel.The payment was introduced when the country was in lockdown, and Ms Humphreys said it was Government policy to restrict travel outside the country because of the pandemic.The Minister said her officials would review cases where people had had their payment stopped.The Government has been sharply criticised by the Opposition and accused of punishing people who had lost their jobs by cutting their payment.Last night, the Dáil passed legislation putting the PUP payment on a statutory basis and extending it to the end of March at a cost of €2.2 billion.In the Dáil on Wednesday the Taoiseach aid the PUP payment was a sign of the Government’s solidarity with the people as he accused the Sinn Féin leader of “play acting”.Ms McDonald had criticised the cutting of the payment from people if they travelled abroad."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Najib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Holding an annual mass gathering of fasting and prayer from February 17 to 21 many branded the supercluster that turned Mulhouse into France’s Covid ground zero and the country into one of the world’s worst hit.For five days, around 2,200 people from around mainland and overseas France, neighbouring Switzerland and Germany and even Burkina Faso sang gospel and clasped hands.“We’re going to celebrate the Lord! Are you feeling the joy tonight?,” the charismatic pastor asked as they prayed for a miracle cure from ailments. Little did he know that the coronavirus had also entered the building and that almost his entire flock would be infected, 80 hospitalised and 31 die from the disease.When followers returned home, they unleashed what one top health official called a “viral nuclear bomb” whose fallout was felt around France.The health minister called it France’s “flipping point”. Its scientific council said without it, the country would be on a par with Germany - only 15 minutes away for 45,000 cross-border commuters but which suffered a third as many deaths.Twisting the knife, the state prefect of the Grand Est region, Josiane Chevalier, accused the church of failing to respect basic “social distancing measures: in short, everything you shouldn’t do”.The claims triggered torrents of hate mail. One of hundreds of messages read: “Thanks again for the French pandemic. We know who you are”.“The main culprit should have died so that this sect could answer for all the evil it has inflicted on Mulhouse!,” read another.Joining his hands, Mr Peterschmitt said: “We have received calls on social media to ‘gun him down with a Kalashnikov’ or ‘burn the church’. A colleague even received death threats at work.”Returning to the four corners of France, believers who fell ill said they were ostracised.Antoinette, a 70-year-old grandmother who lives on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, said she could not be fully identified as believers had been stigmatised by people outside the church for spreading the virus.“People have pointed their finger at me. They need a scapegoat, she said.Indeed, there is mounting evidence that the disease was already spreading relentlessly in the region before the gathering and that French health authorities had failed to pick up far earlier warning signs of impending disaster.President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech barely 200 yards from the church that very week. “He was shaking hands and taking selfies for an hour and a half,” said local shopkeeper Simsek Meleki, 40. \u0027Now people joke that Macron brought the virus with him.”Mr Peterschmitt asked: “How do expect us to know there was a risk if the President of France wasn’t aware of it?Two recent studies, one on chest X-rays in nearby Colmar, another quizzing 3,300 locals, suggest that that the first cases date back to November and that the epidemic had already taken off by mid-February in the area.Laurent Gerbaud, an epidemiologist at Clermont-Ferrand university hospital, said the findings suggested health authorities had failed to detect early warning signals.  “We have a woefully centralised bureaucracy incapable of receiving information from the ground up,” he said.All that said, there was little doubt, he added, that the church gathering turbo-charged contamination in France.Nobody felt ill during the event, but the following week, the pastor came down with flu-like symptoms and by Sunday, at least 800 people didn’t show up to church.On March 2, his son Jonathan tested positive and warned local health authorities about the gathering. That very same day, the first Covid patient was admitted to intensive care in Mulhouse’s Emile-Muller hospital.Joy Mootien, 54, chief consultant at the hospital’s medical intensive care unit remembered his patient zero well.“He was lying in his bed with breathing difficulties. When I saw the chest X-ray, I instinctively grabbed my mask,” he recalled. His family said he had not travelled recently but his wife did mention a large church gathering.“When I heard how big it was, I knew we were in trouble.”That night, Patrick Vogt, 64, a doctor fielding emergency calls in Mulhouse, witnessed the tidal wave.“More than 1,000 people rang in with such symptoms. It was frightening. We weren’t prepared here or in France,” he said. Despite the flood, state authorities calmly announced just six cases in the region the following day.“There was a chasm between what we were seeing on the ground and the official claims the virus was contained,” said Mr Vogt. “We lost two weeks pinpointing the church cluster,” he claimed.On March 5, gasping for air, Mr Peterschmitt was hospitalised. “I felt like a candle in the wind and thought my final hour had come. I was quite calm,” he said. Some 18 members of his family were struck down.That evening, Jean Rottner, 53, a casualty doctor and president of France’s Grand Est region sent a text message to President Emmanuel Macron.“I told him: ‘Watch out, what is happening here is not in line with the discourse we’re hearing in France. Please understand we’re in the midst of an epidemic.” In two days, the number of local cases multiplied by eight.French pride in its globally lauded public health took a huge knock when it realised that Germany was coping far better. Mr Rottner said this was partly down to mass testing, better communication between GPs and hospitals and far more intensive care beds - some 20,000 to France’s 5,000 at the start of the crisis.“But also we had this very particular cluster in Mulhouse which led to a brutal viral explosion. Germany didn’t have to deal with a problem of that magnitude.”At the hospital, very quickly all ICUs were full.“We were not on the front line, we were the front line,” said Marc Noizet, head of A\u0026ampE and emergency services.As critical patients kept arriving, soldiers were dispatched to construct a field hospital in the hospital car park with another 30 beds.Patients were ferried by helicopter to surrounding hospitals, then by plane and specially medicalised TGV fast trains to less affected regions of France. Others were sent to neighbouring Switzerland, Germany, as well as Luxemburg and Austria, whose hospitals were never underwater.In town, taxi driver Salah Aitabbes, 55, recalled: “It was like a science fiction movie with helicopters coming and going, the wail of ambulance sirens, empty streets and hearses.”A few hundred yards from the Open Door Church, Brigitte Ritz’s undertaker business was overwhelmed.“When you work with death, you tame your fear but this was different,” she said, arranging plastic flowers.“The funerary centre had coffins piled up with the air conditioning on full blast. When that was full, they were put in a special refrigerated hangar,” she said.Four months later, the death toll in the Grand Est region’s hospitals from Covid-19 is 3,383 with 1,809 more deaths in nursing homes. France, meanwhile, has just surpassed the 30,000 deaths mark.Many who did pull through intensive care are still struggling to recover.Malika Fisli, an auxiliary nurse from Mulhouse, was plunged into an artificial coma mid-March and woke up in Brest, western France, two weeks later.Today, she has lung scarring that will take up to nine months to heal and requires daily physio to regain 16kg of lost muscle. “I get breathless and have palpitations,” she said.“I still don’t dare go into shops and get angry when I see groups of people without masks.”Mrs Fisli worked in a nursing home, many of which turned into silent death traps. On her floor alone, ten among 49 elderly residents died of the disease and half her colleagues fell ill.She suffers from flashbacks in which she runs towards a blinding light and can hear a man saying: “Unplug her”. “But doctor, she’s only 58 and has four children,” another, female, voice chimes in.It was no nightmare. “During the coma, I heard these things. Afterwards, I asked the nurse if it was true. She went pale and confirmed that it was. I owe her my life,” she said. “But I don’t blame the doctor, he was only doing his job.”Like Malika, Mulhouse - a town with a proud industrial past sometimes referred to as the “French Manchester” - is slowly healing.“We were, without doubt, France’s ground zero,” said Mr Rottner, the Grand Est president.“We all know people who died, families that were affected. We won’t forget that. But we know our challenge is to shed this image of a region that was seriously hit by this disease and show that we can recover.”Others said it was high time to turn the page.“I’m fed up with Mulhouse being singled out as a pestilential city,” said Jean-Claude, a train conductor. “The truth is that for most of us it wasn’t as catastrophic as all that and certainly no worse than in Paris,” he said.As locals return to cafes, bars and restaurants, French health officials are fretting about an uptick in infections with the “R number”, which reflects infection rates, now above one in most regions. But ironically, the only one today below that dangerous watermark is the Grand Est.Back in his empty church, Mr Peterschmitt checked hand gel and spacing between chairs that have quartered capacity to 600.After weeks of online worship from his living room, he was finally about to meet the faithful in the flesh for the first time since that fateful gathering.Still weakened from his illness, he said he was worried about the future.“We’re in a very sensitive area here. What if a madman passed by and shot followers during the next worship?,” he asked.“Human beings are predators for their own kind. All this proves I was right to be a pastor and evangelist. Rousseau said, \u0027man is good but society corrupts him\u0027. The bible says, \u0027the heart of man is bad and society is simply its reflection.\u0027”“We are guilty of nothing. We were a fire in a forest already burning.”Despite his fears, he said he was looking forward to reconnecting with his flock.“I will tell them two things: how happy I am to see them again and to take heart: we can’t keep looking in the rear mirror. Life goes on.’”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"google has given employees one thing crave certainty","story":"As ever in the 21st century, with regard to the direction Western societies take, major tech companies continue to lead the way. This week Google announced that employees would continue to work from home until July 2021, following similar announcements over remote working from Twitter and Facebook in recent months.It is a bold step for three of the largest beasts of Silicon Valley to take, given the amount of resources each has poured into their respective headquarters and other centres to attract the brightest and best from across the world to work for them. It represents a very real shift in the cultures of these companies, built on the idea of interconnectedness and human relationships, and how they will evolve. But then again, all three are also based on the core idea of being connected to other people anywhere in the world with a signal – this is perhaps the best opportunity since the invention of the internet to demonstrate the power and versatility of their respective products at source.The coronavirus disease has spooked people, making the sprawling campuses of Google et al., momentarily at least, far less viable. That is even more true of smaller companies previously straitjacketed by traditional office layouts. And, even if transmission is receding in some places, public confidence is at rock bottom and will probably remain so until a vaccine has been developed, mass produced, and been in circulation for a good few months. Until such a time, many employees, rightly or wrongly, simply won’t feel happy returning to work at places like Google — and companies like Google won’t feel particularly enamoured at the idea of risking becoming hotspots for infection spikes themselves. In the long term, no doubt, many of Google’s workers will come to realise that turning your home into the office isn’t the oasis of calm and convenience it appears now. Sure, not having to brave the outside world as a deadly virus abounds somewhere out in the wild may seem tempting, but the separation between work and life is an important distinction to maintain the internet is an intrusive thing. After a while, people may begin to resent that they are never able to leave the office behind, and that the reach of their boss now extends even further into their bedrooms, bathrooms and living rooms, previously a form of sanctuary.Furthermore, innovative, “creative” companies may also begin to the feel the limitations of curtailed human contact in the process of trying to charge forward. Brainstorming with colleagues around a ping pong table or on a semicircle of beanbags on a grassy lawn may seem naff to the average person, but surely it has to be an easier, more productive process than doing it from your bed with other people only half paying attention and refusing to make eye contact over Skype.But in the short term, in an age of uncertainty, Google’s decision gives its workers a time frame. The schedule of 12 months is what you might call “proper time” – enough to start making more permanent arrangements for everything from work set ups to child care to holidays and even moving house. It allows a semblance of normality to return, elongating the short term into something a lot less unstable than it currently feels like. It also allows the company itself to start making more permanent decisions – taking halted plans out of stasis and forging ahead. Office culture is something that we should not, necessarily, welcome. The so-called “new normal,” with its stresses and limitations, is not something we should ever embrace as normality. But making the abnormal more manageable is a positive step, and that is what Google is trying to do. Only time will tell if the seeds bare fruit, but it has to be better than not sowing anything at all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"belgium luxembourg among brace countries covid rates may lead","story":"Luxembourg and Belgium are at risk of having quarantine reimposed by the Government as their coronavirus rates rise, an analysis by The  suggests.As the Government finalises its weekly review of air bridges, due on Friday, the analysis shows that both Luxembourg and Belgium have seen week-on-week rises in Covid-19 rates to post-lockdown peaks.At least four other countries have rising rates, with Croatia also on an unofficial watchlist following the travel chaos sparked when the Government reimposed quarantine on Spain at the weekend, upturning the holiday plans of up to 1.8 million Britons.On Tuesday, Boris Johnson warned of signs of a second wave of coronavirus in Europe as he defended the 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain.  Belgium has seen its weekly Covid-19 rate rise from 5.3 to 15.1 per 100,000 of the population since the beginning of July, with cases up from 615 to 1,751.The spike in infections has led to Belgium\u0027s government tightening social restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus.Sophie Wilmes, the Belgian prime minister, said that, from Wednesday, a family or those living together can meet only the same five people from outside their household over the next four weeks. Antwerp has introduced a curfew.Luxembourg, which is bordered by Belgium to the north and west, has seen its weekly rates per 100,000 rise from 45.7 to 114.4, with the number of cases up from 286 to 716 in the same period. Use the interactive chart below to explore the infection rate across Europe:Other countries apparently at risk because of rising rates and post-lockdown peaks are the Bahamas, Monaco, Gibraltar and the Czech Republic. There is concern within the Government about Croatia, a major holiday destination for Britons, which is in the top 15 of the UK\u0027s list of quarantine-free countries with its rate of 12.4 per 100,000. This is, however, down on the previous week\u0027s.Mr Johnson said on Tuesday that the Government had to be swift in its response to spikes in coronavirus, and hinted at further action against other countries if necessary.Speaking during a visit to Nottinghamshire, the Prime Minister said: What we have to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risks are starting to bubble up again.Let\u0027s be absolutely clear about what\u0027s happening in Europe. Amongst some of our European friends, I\u0027m afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic.It came as the UK reported a further 119 coronavirus deaths – taking the official number of deaths so far to 45,878 – but the daily figure is typically higher on Tuesdays due to delays in reporting deaths at the weekend.Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) regional director for Europe, said there had been a slight uptick in new cases in the past couple of weeks in Europe as a result of an increasing number of countries experiencing localised outbreaks.He said this appeared to be driven by a higher proportion of new infections among young people who don\u0027t want to miss summer and were more likely to be mixing at parties, bars and clubs.They have a responsibility to themselves, parents, grandparents and communities. We do know how important good health behaviours are. Let\u0027s take advantage of that knowledge, he said.It comes as Heathrow\u0027s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, urged the Government to press ahead with airport tests of passengers for Covid-19 to help rescue summer and revive the economy.We need to find a way of getting \u0027red countries\u0027 opened up again. Testing is the only viable way of doing that in the absence of a vaccine, Mr Holland-Kaye told The  in an exclusive interview.A lot of countries which are red listed have millions of people who don’t have the disease and can’t travel.

It would appear that a destination is more appealing to our neighbours once they know that we will be absent. The most keen to avoid Brits abroad?

But, says our expert Rodney Bolt, peace and quiet is gone from Amsterdam:Visitors are streaming back into town. In parts of the Dutch capital over recent weekends, numbers in the streets topped 60 per cent of their pre-Covid levels.People seeking distraction form the largest proportion of those out and about: young people arriving across the borders by car to party, day-trippers coming to shop, and staycationers weary of lockdown isolation. What Amsterdammers are beginning to term ‘good-time tourism’ means that while many parts of town (such as museums) remain quiet, some quarters – the Dam (Amsterdam’s main city square), the Red Light District, Kalverstraat shopping street, and nightlife hotspots around Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein – become too crowded for comfort, especially over weekends.Read the full story here.Kalverstraat over the weekendCruise ships will be allowed to dock in Greek ports from this weekend after its government announced plans to relax rules.Six major ports – Piraeus in Athens, Rhodos, Iraklio, Volos, Corfu and Katakolo – will welcome vessels from August 1, more than four months after it banned them in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus.Ships will subsequently be able to visit any other Greek port on their itinerary, Tourism Minister Haris Theocharis confirmed.Rules could be reviewed as epidemiological data changes, he added.

Airlines grounded their fleets and routes were scrapped to hinder the spread of Covid-19. Earlier this month a poll of Britons found that two thirds would not feel safe travelling internationally on a plane, up from 40 per cent in June, according to YouGov. But as we have learnt more about the coronavirus, flying has the potential to be one of the safest forms of travel. Iata, the global air travel association, says the risk of catching an infection on an aircraft “is typically lower than in a shopping centre or an office environment”, and as long as demand is recovering it is unlikely planes will be full, enabling some form of social distancing. Read the full story. Costa Rica is to reopen its border to British holidaymakers from Saturday after the UK was included on the nation\u0027s list of low-risk countries. The Central American country is planning a phased return to full capacity, with fewer than five international flights arriving a week at first. Tourism Minister, Gustavo Segura, said: “However, these are drops of hope for more than 600,000 people who directly or indirectly depend on the tourism industry.”Visitors will need to prove they are virus-free with a negative test result no older than 48 hours, then on arrival fill in a track and trace form and purchase special coronavirus insurance that will cover accommodation in case of quarantine and medical expenses. Costa Rica welcomed 78,562 visitors from the UK in 2019 and is popular for its rainforest, wildlife and relaxed way of life. The famed Greek island of Santorini, having registered no cases of coronavirus, has been enjoying lockdown for more reasons than that. Not least down to the lack of cruise ships, which last year could easily number three a day and disgorge up to 10,000 passengers.Santorini rarely looks like thisResident Markos Kafouros, President of Santo Wines, told our reporter Adrian Mourby:“I believe that the pause of cruise ships – whose programme was completely uncoordinated –  gave the island the opportunity to breathe. I think that over the last five years, many visitors to Santorini were not completely satisfied because of all the crowds and traffic. From now on tourism must be more sustainably organised.”Hear more from other locals here.Ski resorts in Colorado have begun to see an influx of summer visitors as lockdown restrictions are lifted in the States.However, while many local businesses have been able to adapt to new Covid-19 safety measures as temperatures remain warm, The Colorado Sun has reported there are fears the same creative approach will be difficult to maintain during the lucrative winter season.Bars, restaurants and cafes in the likes of Breckenridge have been able to expand outdoor seating areas onto streets that have been shut for cars. Large outdoor spaces have also been used to host socially-distanced events. When the weather turns colder and the snow arrives, which it does in abundance in Colorado’s ski resorts from as early as November, these measures will be hard to facilitate meaning skiers could lose out on some of the experiences they\u0027re used to.“We can’t push into Main Street in January… So we are going to have to get real creative once again looking into winter and no one knows yet what that might look like,” Margaret Bowes, the executive director of the Colorado Association of Ski Towns, told the Colorado Sun.Mike Bevens, the Managing Director of popular UK glamping company Canopy \u0026amp Stars, has issued a warning to people booking last-minute holidays through unreliable sources – predominantly on social media.“We have noticed some of our popular spaces, already booked up for August, being advertised via what look like scam social accounts,” Bevens told  Travel. “Guests could turn up to find the holiday they thought they had booked does not exist or already has guests booked in. We are asking guests to be aware and be vigilant.”As summer availability becomes increasingly hard to find across the UK following uncertainty around overseas travel, people seem to be falling for too-good-to-be-true scams out of desperation.The company has issued advice to all those looking to book a last-minute break on home soil, including the following key points:Always pay by debit or credit card, never by bank transferMake sure you check availability and book through the official siteReport anything you think is fraudulent to Action Fraud (actionfraud.police.uk).In a war of words, one of our writers makes the case for leaving Blighty behind, and the other for staying on British shores.How far should we venture?It’s a hassle to travel at the moment, you might say what with the exasperating rules, the ever-morphing guidelines, the baffling logistics, and the muzzled transport experience. But have you seen Britain at the moment? These factors are no less messy. I’d rather be faffing around with one-way systems and hand sanitizer in sunny Spain than a camper van in the New Forest. You are just as safe from coronavirus in most other countries as you are here. It is not ‘less risky’ to have a staycation this summer, with our infection rates, it might actually be more. And it’s not selfish to go abroad in plenty of destinations, you’re doing them a favour. To that end, I would argue that if you possibly can, there has never been a better time to explore the fine tourist-free countries that have just rolled down their drawbridge.If I had just one nation to explore for the rest of my life, it would undoubtedly be our pretty little isles – in spite of the weather.When you add in the Covid conundrum, for me, it’s a no-brainer. Not just because of the thought of navigating airports and planes in a pandemic-ridden, mask-wearing world – although, really, who wants to go through that right now? – the insurance worries, or the threat of having quarantine unfairly foisted on you at the drop of the hat on your return, but because of the wonderful people in our hospitality and tourism industry. The pandemic has made us all adapt to a new way of living, and, for a summer at least, we have our glorious isles almost to ourselves. So make the most of it.Read the full story here.... what does that mean for your refund? Ryanair is refusing to cancel flights to Spain, despite the FCO now advising against all non-essential travel to the country.The airline says that Spain is still open for tourism, and thus it will not be reimbursing anyone who wants to cancel their flights, while those who want to switch destinations must still pay a flight change fee if their bookings were made before June 10.Troublesome.

Churches remain exempt.It comes as the country, which has one of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in Europe, reported a small flare-up of Covid-19 infections in the second half of the month, according to Reuters. Romania has also announced that face masks will be mandatory outdoors at certain times and in places prone to overcrowding, as more than 1,000 new cases have been recorded daily over the past week.Elsewhere, Spain\u0027s laws mean that in some regions, face coverings must be worn in all public settings, inside and out, with €100 fines for those who breach the rules Turkey has similar requirements. Scandinavian countries including Sweden and Norway are among the few in Europe where face masks are not compulsory in most situations.Spain is off the menu, as (still) is Portugal, with the Government claiming high infection rates are to blame. It sounds almost reasonable – until you consider the case of Luxembourg, which remains on the FCO safe list.  The latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show that the 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents is 15 in the UK, 33.9 in Portugal, and 47.2 in Spain. And Luxembourg? 222.4. So why is Spain being picked on? Other countries with higher rates of infection than the UK include France (16), Croatia (27.1), and Belgium (29.1). It is far lower in Italy (5.1) and Greece (3.7).Covid-19 infections on the riseUnplanned moments are what makes holidays – and, indeed, life – worth living, writes Rob Crossan. I won’t embarrass the owner of the bed and breakfast where I stayed by naming them as they were clearly trying their best. But being told that I had a ‘strict 25-minute window’ to eat breakfast which I needed to ‘book in’ the night before hardly conspires to create a freewheeling, ‘all hands off deck’ vacation vibe.All the local pubs and restaurants, naturally, required a couple of phone calls and, in one case, a reassurance that I wasn’t ill, before I could get a table for a simple drink or meal. Day trips were also devoid of the impulse gene. My lifelong breezy assurances that ‘they’ll just let us in’, which have served me remarkably well over the years when it comes to gaining entry to everything from theme parks to National Trust properties no longer applies.

Unfortunately the recent unstructured re-imposition of quarantine for Spain is creating renewed uncertainty and unpredictability for consumers.We encourage the Government to work collaboratively with the industry to deliver a more targeted and structured approach. We need targeted quarantine requirements for regions where spikes have occurred rather than applied at a national level. In the case of Spain its islands are hundreds of miles from the mainland and have very low infection rates with the Canaries, for example, as low as 2 per 100,000 in the past seven days which is significantly lower than the UK.We want to work with the government to find a way forward which can help customers plan their next break with confidence. The recent situation with Spain has again demonstrated how difficult it is for both the industry and holidaymakers to plan along with hotel and destinations partners needing to make challenging decisions about their businesses and employees where they so heavily rely on tourism. For these reasons I urge the government to have an open dialogue with the industry and quickly move to targeted and regional measures so that we can all stay safe and enjoy a much-deserved summer holiday.Hong Kong is on the verge of a large-scale coronavirus outbreak that could overwhelm hospitals, its leader warned today as authorities implemented their toughest social distancing measures yet.From July 29 all residents in the densely packed city of 7.5 million must wear masks when they leave their homes while restaurants can only serve takeaway meals.No more than two people from different households can gather in public with fines of up to HK$5,000 ($625) for those who breach the new emergency rules.Read the full story here and follow our coronavirus live blog for the latest updates.As we reported earlier this month, London has never been less crowded.

The local council leader in a small rural district on the Dutch border, Mr Pusch is not exactly a household name. But it was he who ordered the lockdown that successfully contained the first outbreak of the virus in Germany — arguably saving thousands of lives.Today, there’s little to suggest that anything out of the ordinary happened in Gangelt, a sleepy market town of dark red brick houses and well tended flower beds in the northern Rhineland.There are none of the scars you find in the worst-hit Italian and Spanish towns. But for the plastic tape sealing off alternate pews in the 14th century church, and the facemasks worn by shoppers, life has returned to normal.But this was the town at the epicentre of Germany’s first coronavirus outbreak — and but for Mr Pusch, things could have been much worse here.On the night of February 25, Mr Pusch was woken at home by an urgent phone call. “We’ve got a problem,” his deputy said. “I think you’d better come back in.”A couple living in Gangelt had tested positive for the coronavirus. They were too sick to be treated at the local hospital and had been rushed to Düsseldorf, where they were in intensive care, unable to breathe unaided. Mr Pusch returned to his office in Heinsberg, a larger town about half an hour’s drive from Gangelt, where his team were already assembling. As they briefed him, it became clear how serious the situation was.Unlike the handful of previous cases in Germany, the infected couple had not just returned from a trip to a seriously affected country like China or Italy. They hadn\u0027t been abroad in months. Germany was facing its first homegrown outbreak of the deadly virus.“I remember thinking, why me?” the 51-year-old Mr Pusch says today. “I’d been watching the television pictures from Italy, I knew what the virus could do.”He tried to get in touch with officials at the health ministry in the regional capital, Düsseldorf — under Germany’s federal system, healthcare is the responsibility of the 16 states. But it was the final night of Carnival, a major holiday in the Rhineland, and he couldn’t get through to anyone senior enough. “I’d seen how quickly the health system in Italy was overwhelmed,” he says. “I knew we couldn’t afford to wait. We had to act to protect our system. I realised I was going to have to make the decision.”That night, Mr Pusch ordered the entire district to be put under lockdown. In the hours that followed, he instructed council officials to find everyone the infected couple had been in contact with, get them to self-isolate and have them tested as soon as possible.As the officials raced to find out who the couple had been in contact with, it became chillingly clear what they were up against.The couple had been leading a busy social life. The week before they had attended a carnival party in Langbroich, a village just outside Gangelt. The village hall had been packed with more than 300 people drinking, singing and partying — exactly the sort of event we now know as a coronavirus hotspot.The infected man was an estate agent. His wife was a kindergarten teacher. Between them they had been in contact with more than 1,000 people in the time they could have been infectious.Mr Pusch knew he was facing a potential crisis. But in the cold light of the next day, he also realised he was asking a lot of the local population. He had just put a quarter of a million people under lockdown — a decision that could threaten their jobs and livelihoods. He had to get public support, or things could quickly unravel.So he filmed a short video address in his office, explaining the situation and what measures he had taken, and put it on the council’s Facebook page. It was the local council version of the televised addresses Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel and other world leaders made at the height of the crisis. And it worked. Mr Pusch continued to make the short Facebook videos throughout the crisis, reassuring local citizens and keeping them informed.In the end, 83 people died of the coronavirus in Gangelt and the surrounding district of Heinsberg. That was bad enough — but it could have been much worse. The strategy adopted in Heinsberg — a prompt lockdown and tracing possible chains of infection — is one that is now widely recognised as a major reason why Germany has been less severely affected than most European countries.The same strategy was recently used successfully to contain a new outbreak at a pig slaughterhouse in western Germany. Mr Pusch and his team didn’t invent it. The advice and guidelines had already been drawn up by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s infectious diseases centre. But by taking the decision to order the lockdown on his own, without support from above, Mr Pusch avoided a potentially disastrous delay.“It was a team effort,” he says. “We all played a part. But some one had to take the responsibility for making the decision, and I knew that was going to have to be me.”Germany has won praise — and envy — for the extent to which it prepared for the virus. Government scientists were warning of the risk months before the Gangelt outbreak, and had already set up huge testing capacity.But it is often forgotten amid the plaudits that there were serious shortages in Germany too. Mr Pusch had to fight to get sufficient supplies of facemasks for doctors and medical staff. At one point he wrote to the Chinese government asking for masks, before a German company stepped in with supplies.It was not the only time Mr Pusch found himself forced to wade into areas that are generally not part of a local council leader’s purview.  “At the outset the rule was that any medical personnel who’d been in contact with some one who was infected had to self-isolate,” he says . “But if we’d done that, we’d soon have had no medical staff at all. I had doctors calling me, saying ‘I can’t stay at home, my patients will die’. “So we changed the rules. We decided medical personnel only had to self-isolate if they tested positive or showed symptoms. After we changed it here they made the same change nationwide.”“It was really impressive what Stefan Pusch did,” Kirstin Day, who works as a hairdresser in Gangelt, says. “The way he explained what he was doing to people and got them on board.”Ms Day, whose husband is from Dewsbury, lived in the UK for some years before the couple relocated to her native Germany.She says the mood in Gangelt remained calm even in the darkest days of the outbreak. “It was frightening, yes. But people really helped each other. People were asking after their neighbours, doing the shopping for those who couldn’t. They got each other through it.”The couple who were first infected have not been named and have not come forward publicly, but both survived and have since returned to work.But the town is not entirely unscarred. Sasha Van Vehmandahl, a local car mechanic, tells how his grandfather died of other causes during the lockdown and only 30 people were allowed to attend the funeral.Georg Wichert still comes every day to open his antique shop in the high street, but there are few customers. “People used to come from big cities like Düsseldorf,” the 68-year-old says. “My shop had a good reputation and I had a lot of loyal customers. But now everyone is nervous to come here because of the virus.“It’s not so bad for me, I only started this shop as a hobby for my retirement. But it’s tough for the younger people. I don’t know what sort of future a small town like Gangelt has now. Everyone’s worried about a second wave.”Today, the village hall just outside Gangelt where the outbreak started is deserted: a small, one-storey building around the corner from the village church and a memorial to Germany’s dead in two world wars.But on that carnival night in February it must have been packed to capacity — it doesn’t look large enough to hold 300 people. “From what we now know about the virus, it was the perfect environment for the sort of ‘superspreader’ event that is the main path of infection,” says Prof Hendrik Streeck of Bonn University. “The virus spreads through sustained contact — either over a period of time, or in places where many people are crowded together with poor ventilation.”The most notorious example is the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl which is thought to have spread cases around Europe after people played drinking games crammed together in apres ski bars.Prof Streeck, one of Germany’s leading virologists, arrived in Gangelt shortly after the outbreak in the town, tasked by the regional government with studying the virus. He went on to conduct one of the first comprehensive studies of the virus’ effects on a community in the town. The study was highly controversial when it was first published, after Prof Streeck and his team found 15 per cent of the local community had developed antibodies despite the low death toll.Since then, other studies have found far higher immunity figures. A study in Ischgl found 42 per cent of residents had antibodies to the virus, and one in the hard-hit Italian city of Bergamo found them in 57 per cent of local people.“It just comes down to how long the virus has been somewhere and how long a community has been exposed,” says Prof Streeck.He says the fears of a second wave are based on a misunderstanding of how the virus works.  “I don’t think we’re going to see the sort of second wave people are talking about. I think we’re already living in a sustained wave, where we’re going to see constant new outbreaks like the one in Gütersloh.”He is referring to the outbreak at the pig slaughterhouse, which saw more than 1,550 people test positive for the virus, but which appears to have been successfully contained.Gangelt and Gütersloh may have survived the virus, but Prof Streeck’s view of the future is not exactly comforting.“We have to be realistic about a vaccine,” he says. “We still don\u0027t have fully effective vaccines against any of the big infectious killers: HIV, malaria, dengue, tuberculosis, and we’ve been trying for decades. Even if we manage to develop a vaccine by the end of this year, it would be months before it’s ready for general use.“We have to get used to living with the virus. Because the chances are it’s going to be with us for a long time.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia says close worlds first approval covid 19 vaccine","story":"A top Russian official says that the country’s coronavirus vaccine is nearing the end of clinical trials and is likely to get approval in mid-August, potentially making it the world\u0027s first approved vaccine against the disease.Russia currently has at least three vaccines in development, and President Vladimir Putin, who chaired a conference call on the epidemic on Wednesday, has said that developing one would be a matter of national pride.One of the three vaccines is nearing the end of clinical trials and is likely to be approved next month, Tatyana Golikova, a deputy prime minister, told the meeting on Wednesday “We’re planning to give it a state registration in August 2020 as long as there are clinical trials for 1,600 people following approval,” she said, adding that Russia hopes to begin manufacturing the vaccine as early as in September.Russia’s previous announcement about fast-tracking clinical trials has raised questions about the safety of the new vaccine.President Putin on Wednesday assured the nation that it would not be used unless it is proven to be safe. “We have to be absolutely sure about the vaccine,” he said in televised remarks.“This is what we’re going to proceed from before we make further decisions on coronavirus vaccination.”Ms Golikova’s remarks follow a CNN interview with the head of Russia’s sovereign welfare fund that bankrolls research and development for the coronavirus vaccine at the Gamalei Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.Mr Dmitriev said on Tuesday that the Gamaeli Institute is looking at 10 August as the earliest date to get approval, potentially making it the world’s first approved vaccine.“Russia will have got there first,” Mr Dmitriev told CNN, likening the Russian coronavirus research to the successful launch of the world’s first satellite by the Soviet Union in 1957.The fund’s spokesman confirmed Mr Dmitriev’s remarks to the  but would not offer further detail.Mr Dmitriev has said that he hopes for Russia to produce about 30 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the yearRussia has also struck manufacturing deals with five other countries and could be producing up to 170 million doses abroad this year, he said.Mike Ryan, executive director at the World Health Organisation, said earlier this months that there is a long way to go before the world gets its first approved vaccine.The British government, in the meantime, has signed a deal with pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur for 60 million doses of a potential Covid-19 vaccine if the tests prove to be successful.Russia\u0027s Gamalei Institute is a reputable research centre which has developed clinically approved vaccines against MERS and Ebola but it has faced criticism of the scientific community after its director revealed that he and other staff self-administered the vaccine way before the start of human trials.Mr Dmitriev, a close ally of President Putin, has also said that he and his family have tried the vaccine.Earlier this month, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre revealed that a Russian hacking group had attempted to steal vaccine research from the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.The Gamalei Institute which announced a successful end of the first phase of human trials just days before the NCSC’s announcement vehemently denied a suggestion that Russian scientists might have benefited from the hack.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/21/15/5.-kiss-you-video-still.jpg","title":"celebrate 10 years of one direction with spotifys new platform experiences","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Calling all 1D stans!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have discovered why coronavirus causes some patients to lose their sense of smell. Temporary loss of smell, or anosmia, is one of the earliest and most commonly reported warning signs of Covid-19. Studies suggest the “devastating” symptom better predicts the disease than other well-known symptoms such as a fever or cough. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the actual cause for loss of smell in Covid-19 patients has been unclear – until now. Researchers at Harvard Medical School in the United States have identified which cell types used for smelling are most vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Why are loss of smell and taste symptoms of coronavirus?UK strikes deal for 60 million doses of potential coronavirus vaccineNo \u0027viable\u0027 alternative to 14-day UK quarantine, says cabinet ministerBoris Johnson says European second wave could mean more quarantinesThey were surprised to discover sensory neurons, which detect and transmit the sense of smell to the brain, are not vulnerable to the disease. Their study instead found it attacks the cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons. Dr Sandeep Robert Datta, associate professor of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the study, said this was a positive finding because it suggests most cases of Covid-19 are unlikely to cause a permanent loss of smell. He said: “Our findings indicate that the novel coronavirus changes the sense of smell in patients not by directly infecting neurons but by affecting the function of supporting cells. “I think it’s good news, because once the infection clears, olfactory neurons don’t appear to need to be replaced or rebuilt from scratch.” But, he added: “We need more data and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms to confirm this conclusion.” Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolThe majority of Covid-19 patients experience some level of anosmia, but most often it is temporary.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The farm at the centre of a horrific goat cruelty scandal revealed by The Independent may have to be shut down, its owner has said.Animals were secretly filmed being punched, kicked and slammed on their back at Far Marsh Farm, near Hull in East Yorkshire.Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Marks and Spencer all said they would immediately drop St Helen’s Farm dairy products – which are made using milk produced at Far Marsh – after being alerted to the brutality on Monday. On Tuesday, Ocado did likewise.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow, Angus Wielkopolski, founder of Yorkshire Dairy Goats which owns the farm, has told The Independent he is disgusted by what he saw in the video and says he is facing having to close the 4,000-animal site if he cannot salvage its reputation.Three out of its 10 staff have already been dismissed for gross misconduct while a fourth has been placed on an immediate final written warning. On Tuesday morning, just hours after the abuse was revealed, CCTV was being installed across the plant so its general manager – who says he was unaware of the abuse – could monitor animal treatment by workers.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milk“We are totally shocked and disgusted by what we have seen on that video,” Mr Wielkopolski said. “We are horrified. We had no idea this was going on. If we had known, we would have stopped it instantly. We have always made animal welfare a top priority…“It’s a big farm which runs 18 hours a day, seven days a week and the manager can’t supervise everything. We trusted our people. We cannot believe that they have done this. I have to believe it because I have seen the footage but if you had told me two days ago this was happening, I wouldn’t have believed it.”Asked what the revelation might do to business, the 65-year-old said: “I don’t want to speculate at the moment but whether the farm continues, we will have to see. You cannot run a dairy farm if you cannot sell the milk. It is not possible.”Mr Wielkopolski and wife Kathleen have run Yorkshire Dairy Goats and sister business A\u0026ampK Wielkopolski for 35 years. They own a second farm, also in East Yorkshire, with another 4,000 goats.He said milk produced across the two sites had helped popularise the product in a period when increasing numbers of people have sought alternatives to cow’s milk. But he added: “We have worked hard for 35 years and that could all get destroyed overnight.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is obvious that the opposite is true at one of their supplying farms.”About an hour’s worth of video was passed to the group.In it, goats at Far Marsh – which is between the villages of Keyingham and Ottringham – were seen being kicked and punched, beaten with a pole, held by the throat and having their tails twisted.In one clip, goats were slammed onto their backs on a conveyor belt before their hooves were roughly trimmed. In another, an animal was seen being dragged by one leg along the ground while struggling.All of Britain’s leading supermarket chains said on Monday they would remove the St Helen’s Farm range from their shelves pending further investigation after being shown the footage by The Independent.But Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose were continuing to sell the brand’s milk, cheese and butter in three south London supermarkets visited by The Independent on Tuesday.Waitrose and Tesco both said they had stopped new orders of the products but would sell remaining stock already in stores.“We take animal welfare very seriously and have suspended all new orders from this company yesterday while we investigate. So what you see on our shelves will have been received before this date,” a Waitrose spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s insisted “all products are being removed from sale”.St Helen’s Farm – which also uses goats milk from several other farms – has already ceased buying produce from Yorkshire Dairy Goats.Speaking after the initial revelations on Monday, a company spokesperson said: “Today we have been made aware of allegations that one farm has infringed animal welfare standards, which we would find totally unacceptable if true.“We have immediately ceased all milk supply from this farm and launched a full investigation to determine the facts of this matter.”The Animal Welfare Act 2006 states animals, including farm animals, must be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A gridlock in the UK’s visa processing system has left people unable to work or travel to see dying relatives during the pandemic despite being legally resident, prompting renewed criticism of the Home Office’s privatised visa service.Hundreds and possibly thousands of foreign nationals have been left in a “state of limbo” after being informed that although visa centres have reopened, they must continue to wait before they can proceed with submitting their biometrics.Foreign nationals in the UK are required to submit their biometric information, such as fingerprints, in order to obtain a visa. This process usually takes place in centres across the country run by firm Sopra Steria, which is contracted by the Home Office to deliver the service.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBefore the private company took over the contract last year, applicants could go to their local post office to provide biometric data. Under Sopra Steria’s service, they must attend one of six “core centres” across the country that offer a free service, or one of another 51 that usually charge a fee starting from £69.99.However, these centres were closed in March because of the lockdown, putting the process on hold. A phased reopening of the centres began on 1 June, but nearly two months on, many applicants are still “in limbo”.People left without proof of UK status as visa centre fees soarAt the start of July, the Home Office informed applicants who had previously applied for UK visas that they would be put through a new process which would reuse biometrics they had submitted previously, and that therefore they could not book an appointment at one of the visa centres. But there has been no update since on when this new process will begin.Meanwhile, first-time applicants, who can still book appointments, have found that there are no free appointments being offered by Sopra Steria, despite the fact that all core centres are supposed to provide slots without charge. This has left some unable to afford to submit their biometrics, or having to travel long distances to do so.David Pountney, senior solicitor at Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), told The Independent there would be hundreds, if not thousands, of people in this situation.“Without having that current, valid immigration document, people run into difficulties. People don’t have the documents and they don’t have anything else they can use to prove their right to be here,” he said.“Although in theory an employer or a landlord could contact the Home Office to check their immigration status, they’re not likely to, and even if they do, the Home Office sometimes get it wrong.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Pountney said the lack of clarity around the new system of reusing biometrics was making it “impossible” to advise clients: “Clients keep asking us when something is going to happen, and we just don’t know. We’ve got no clarity on who is likely to be covered by this new system or what the process is, so we have to play it by ear.”Andrew Tingley, partner and head of immigration at Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP, said: “Thousand of applicants are currently in limbo as a result of the Home Office policy of allowing the re-use of biometrics.” He argued that visa applicants should be given the choice on whether to opt into the new system of reusing biometrics.Filipino national Sharon Phillips, 32, moved to the UK in December 2019 to join her husband Hywel on a six-month finance visa. They married in February and applied for her spouse visa in May, but the closure of visa centres meant she couldn’t submit her biometrics at the time.The couple assumed that once the centres opened in June, they would be able to continue with the process, but they are still waiting – and until Sharon obtains her spouse visa, she is unable to work.Sharon, who worked as a domestic worker in Malaysia before she came to the UK, said: “It’s frustrating. I can’t work. I can’t travel. I can’t do anything right now. I was hoping to work in a care home. I know there are vacancies in care homes at the moment. I want to, but what do I do?“Financially I don’t have anything right now. I’m totally reliant on my husband. He’s also supporting my family back home in the Philippines.“I’m just at home. I have nothing to look forward to. I’m hoping none of my family get sick because if that happens, I won’t be able to go back home to see them. We’re just waiting and waiting. I’m just stuck in limbo.”Hywel, 31, who met Sharon while studying in Malaysia, said: “It’s hard to believe that they shut down all visa processing for three months, when it’s such an essential service. And it looks like there was no forward thinking about how to deal with the backlog once it reopened.“We’ve been trying to wait patiently, but there’s so much uncertainty. We’ve now been told we have to go down this path of reusing biometrics, but it’s a new system that hasn’t been tested, and there’s no date for it yet. Will it be one more month? Will it be three more months? We really don’t know how long this will take.”Emre and Elif Gunes said they were feeling “desperate” because, as a result of the delays, they have been unable to travel to Turkey to visit Elif’s father, who has cancer and has been in a critical state since 13 July.The Turkish couple, both of whom work as engineers in the UK, applied for an extension in April as the visas were set to expire on 19 June, but – although the process should normally take a few weeks – they still haven’t been able to submit their biometrics in order to complete the process.They were hopeful when Sopra Steria announced on 1 June that appointments would be allocated by the order of the application submission dates, but they have since been told that they will be going through the new process of reusing previously submitted biometrics, and have been given no time frame as to when it will be up and running.Elif, 29, said: ”I feel guilt and desperation every second of every day knowing that my family needs my support more than ever before, but I cannot promise them I will be there soon. This adds another unbearable dimension to my existing sorrow and fears.“My heart beats fast whenever my phone rings, not only because I am scared to hear any more bad news about my father’s situation but also I do not know what is going to happen to my job and life here if I choose to go home. Do I have to leave my job and life behind just because this visa extension process is not working properly? This is the pressure I am under constantly.”Emre, 31, said that on top of the distress of being unable to see his father-in-law, he was concerned about losing his job and, in the current situation, being unable to find a new one: “It was already too much stress for me. What I am going to do if I lose my job due to the pandemic? Will it be possible to find a new job with sponsorship?”Debasish Dash, a mathematician who has been working in the UK since 2016, has been unable to take up a job as a lecturer at Strathclyde University, which he was supposed to start at the beginning of July, because it has not been possible for him to complete the visa process.The 33-year-old Indian national, who applied for a Global Talent Visa – which the government introduced in February to attract “talented and promising iniduals in specific sectors” – is currently working at Cambridge University in a job that he was supposed to have left a month ago. The university has been able to source additional research funding for him to continue, but this will end in August.“I will be unemployed. Researchers are not paid a lot. Because of the government’s mistake I’ll have to dig into my savings and start paying my rent and my bills from my savings. It just makes no sense,” he said.“It’s nonsense. Everything was in place for me to start the new job in July, but now I don’t know how long I will have to wait because the government is not telling us anything.“Banks and post offices were open. Why were visa centres closed for two months? Even since they’ve opened, why is there a complete lack of urgency? They’re very slow and they’re giving us no time frame. They’re trying to attract talented people, yet they’re putting me through this stress.”Another Indian national, who didn’t want to be named, said he was afraid to go outside in case anyone in authority requested to see his residence permit, which he is currently unable to provide because his visa ran out on 30 May, and he hasn’t been able to process his new one because has been told to wait for the new biometrics service.The 25-year-old, who moved to the UK in January 2017 and works in the IT sector, said: “I find it tough to go out because police may ask for your permit to stay in the UK and I don’t have that. I’ve hardly been out in the last two months.“I’m worried. I don’t have any proof of my status to show I’m eligible to be in this country. I can’t do anything. It’s important to have freedom and to have a visa to show you’re allowed to be in this country. What we’re going through is something no one is noticing.”The young man said he was also distressed by the fact that his sister had recently given birth to her first child in India, and he had been unable to travel to see his family.A Sopra Steria spokesperson said: “We recognise it has been a difficult time for people unable to access appointments because of the global pandemic.”They confirmed that the firm was looking to introduce new measures involving the reuse of fingerprint biometrics that have been recorded in a previous application, and said more information would be provided on this “very soon”.The spokesperson said that since the phased reopening of centres on 1 June, the company had made “significant” progress in reducing the number of customers waiting for an appointment and was working to release new appointments.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on some visa services as we operate with a reduced capacity to observe social distancing. We’ve adapted our working practices in order to clear applications as soon as possible, which includes reusing the fingerprint biometrics of some of our customers to re-enrol and stop people having to attend in person.”UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Attendees will be questioned virtually, in keeping with coronavirus restrictions.TikTok – which is not at today\u0027s hearing, but will undoubtedly be affected by what happens there, given how closely it competes with Facebook and its products – has posted a long essay about fair competition and transparency. It doesn\u0027t make reference to the hearings today, but it is clear the context it has been posted in.TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy, CEO Kevin Mayer concludes.\u0026nbspThe bigger move is to use this moment to drive deeper conversations around algorithms, transparency, and content moderation, and to develop stricter rules of the road. We are taking the first step of many to address these concerns, and call on the industry to follow our lead for the benefit of users and creators everywhere.TikTok is likely to be the big spectre haunting today\u0027s hearings. Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s suggestion that limiting Facebook will allow for non-American companies to fill its place appears to be at least hinting at TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company Bytedance. Mr Mayer takes on those comments – as well as offering a little snark at Facebook\u0027s attempts to emulate TikTok\u0027s app.At TikTok we welcome competition, he writes.\u0026nbspWe think fair competition makes all of us better. To those who wish to launch competitive products, we say bring it on. Facebook is even launching another copycat product, Reels (tied to Instagram), after their other copycat Lasso failed quickly. But let\u0027s focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor – namely Facebook – disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the US.And here\u0027s a preview from Reuters, too:The CEOs of four of America\u0027s largest\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspfirms will testify before U.S.\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspon Wednesday in a hearing that promises a healthy dose of political theater, while also offering a window into the thinking of lawmakers trying to rein in Big\u0026nbspTech.Facebook Inc\u0027s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon Inc\u0027s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u0027s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u0027s Tim Cook - who together represent about $5 trillion of the U.S. economy - are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee\u0027s antitrust panel.Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.The CEOs plan to defend themselves\u0026nbspby saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term.The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before\u0026nbspCongress.The hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to\u0026nbspCongressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year, said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads\u0026nbsptechnology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspcompanies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers\u0027 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbspoperates. Previous high-profile hearings involving\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspcompanies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and\u0026nbsptechnology work.It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship - an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbspcompanies.A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspplatforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the Associated Press\u0027s look ahead to what is likely to happen today, and the questions the CEOs are expected to face:Four Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbspCEOs — Facebook\u0027s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u0027s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple — are set to answer for their companies\u0027 practices before\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspas a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.The four command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them is the world\u0027s richest inidual (Bezos) another is the fourth-ranked billionaire (Zuckerberg). Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users\u0027 personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.Critics question whether the companies, grown increasingly powerful after gobbling up scores of rivals, stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.In its bipartisan investigation, the panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspgiants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbsppoints toward possible new restrictions on its power.The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from\u0026nbspCongress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u0027 practices.\u0026nbspAnd, finally, here\u0027s Amazon\u0027s Jeff Bezos.He leans most keenly – or at least most poetically – into the patriotic, American line: in his concluding paragraphs, he says that the rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the US. Much of that argument is made with reference to his own biography, talking about his mother\u0027s experience of having him young, and his dad\u0027s experience of moving to the US from Cuba.Otherwise, his argument is much the same: actually, there\u0027s a lot more competition, and actually, people like using Amazon. But he also leans heavily into claims about the number of jobs being created by the company.Here\u0027s Google\u0027s Sundar Pichai. He doesn\u0027t spend quite so much time arguing that Google is not big, or that being big isn\u0027t such a bad thing – instead, his main argument is that Google is an American success story, and thereby implying that any regulation could undo that American success.We are commied to panering with lawmakers, including the members of this Commiee, to protect consumers, maintain America’s competitive technological edge in the world, and ensure that every American has access to the incredible oppounities that technology creates, he concludes.Here\u0027s Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s introductory remarks, too.He takes a similar tone to Tim Cook, and provides some similar arguments. But he leans a little more into the fact that Facebook\u0027s continuing success is not guaranteed. (He only mentions China in passing, but does stress the fact that Facebook is American, and the remarks are thought to relate to that.)I’ve long believed that the nature of our industry is that someday a product will replace Facebook, he concludes.\u0026nbspI want us to be the ones that build it, because if we don’t, someone else will.Tim Cook\u0027s full opening statement – which he will give when he appears later on –\u0026nbspcan be read here. He focuses mostly on the App Store (which is probably what the questioners will focus on with regards to him, too).His argument is along the lines the other three are expected to take, too: that his company isn\u0027t actually all that big, is not dominant in every market, and that limiting it through regulation could mean it losing out to non-US companies.Welcome to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s live coverage of Big Tech\u0027s appearance before Congress later today.The leaders of the world\u0027s biggest tech companies – Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google – will all be questioned by US politicians eager to delve into the ways that the size and power of the companies could be being unfairly wielded, among other issues.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a blog post on Tuesday, MacKenzie Scott said she donated $1.7 billion (£1.3 bn) of her wealth in the past year to causes including racial equality, LGBT+ rights, public health and climate change. Ms Scott, who was previously known as MacKenzie Bezos, also announced her new last name, which she said was taken from her middle name.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt comes after Ms Scott last year committed to donating the majority of her fortune after her split from the world’s richest man, Mr Bezos, who left her with a 4 per cent stake in Amazon.“Like many, I watched the first half of 2020 with a mixture of heartbreak and horror,” she wrote in a post on Medium, outlining her donations.Amazon primed for a battle royale with Britain’s supermarkets If you think a new ‘Amazon tax’ will save the high street, think againAmazon founder Jeff Bezos adds $13bn to personal fortune in 24 hoursGreta Thunberg donates £90,000 to help Amazon tribes fight coronavirusAmazon asks employees to delete TikTok ‘due to security risks’“I began work to complete my pledge with the belief that my life had yielded two assets that could be of particular value to others,” she wrote.. “The money these systems helped deliver to me, and a conviction that people who have experience with inequities are the ones best equipped to design solutions,” she added.Announcing her commitment last year, she told The Giving Pledge campaign that she had “a disproportionate amount of money to share”.According to The Giving Pledge, more than 200 wealthy iniduals and families have committed to donating most of their wealth to philanthropic causes.At the time of the orce, Ms Scott’s stake was worth about $36 billion (£27 bn).

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She speaks to Oliver Carroll\u0026nbspahead of next week\u0027s electionThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Over the next two weeks, Alexander Lukashenko faces the fight of his life. It was never supposed to be like this – not in Belarus. Not with a self-styled dictator who has previously declared election victories with 75.6 per cent, 82.6 per cent, 79.65 per cent, and 84.14 per cent of the vote. Not with a sophisticated system of modern authoritarianism, one that made independent political activity the preserve of the brave and foolhardy. This time around, the regime did all the things it usually does. Election officials refused to register the three strongest challengers from the field. Out went Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the US, Viktor Babariko, a banker, and Sergei Tikhanovski, advertising entrepreneur and popular political blogger. The latter two were arrested and jailed for their troubles. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBelarus headed for election confrontation as Lukashenko cracks downDespite all that, the 9 August election is gearing up to be the political story of the summer. Battered by criticism over his Covid-19 denialism, the five-term incumbent Lukashenko appears to be in real trouble: regularly upstaged by opposition forces, with unprecedented protests taking place across the country. Even more embarrassing for the macho leader who claims the presidency is “too much for a woman” to handle, his most obvious nemesis is female. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of jailed Sergei Tikhonovsky, was propelled into politics following the arrest of her husband in May. A former translator, secretary and, for the last 10 years, a shy, stay-at-home mum, she tells The Independent she is no politician. She spent much of the last year persuading her “opinionated” husband to do what everyone else in the country did – lie low. She says she anguished as she witnessed surveillance and arrests step up in line with Sergei’s YouTube popularity and informal campaign around the end of last year. But Ms Tikhanovskaya says she knew she had “no right” to stop her husband, and the last time he was arrested, vowed to continue his work. She registered as a candidate. Extraordinarily for a declared opposition candidate in Belarus, she was allowed to run. Defying predictions the opposition would find it difficult to unite, Ms Tikhanovskaya snapped to common language with Maria Kolesnikova, the head of Viktor Barbariko’s presidential campaign, and Veronika Tsepkalo, wife of Valery, the other barred candidate. The basics of an agreement were hammered out in 15 minutes, and a full oral understanding in under a couple of hours. As the registered candidate, Ms Tikhanovskaya would lead the campaign platform. There would be just three pledges: to free political prisoners, reverse authoritarian changes to the constitution made in 1996, and to run new, free elections within six months. The three women announced their decision with a photoshoot: Ms Tikhanovskaya appeared with a clenched fist, flanked by Ms Tsepkalo with a “V” for victory sign and Ms Kolesnikova, with a heart. The symbolism was “spontaneous”, Ms Tikhanovskaya insists, and one of the very few things the group committed to paper. “Don’t think it was some campaign prepared months ago. It was all about the situation we found ourselves in.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAlexander Lukashenko cannot survive as president of BelarusCoronavirus spreads rapidly in Belarus as leader denies it existsFor some, the optics were too perfect. The instant agreement. The women leaders. The fact Ms Tikhanovskaya was registered in the first place. Elements of the Belarusian opposition converged with an unusual ally, Mr Lukashenko, in blaming the invisible hand of Moscow – an ungraspable law of nature in these parts. Those who wanted evidence found it easily enough. Viktor Babariko made his money as a manager for a bank owned by Russia’s Gazprom. Valery Tsepkalo retains links with the Belarusian elite – and fled to Russia with his children shortly after his non-registration. Nationalistic opponents of Sergei Tikhanovsky have also criticised his production contracts with Russian stars. Ms Tikhanovskaya rejects the criticism as “silly rumours” that are “impossible to engage with”. She couldn’t speak on behalf of the other campaign teams, but as far as her husband was concerned, she was “more than sure” of his propriety. She saw how he had “looked for kopecks” to pay for petrol while campaigning. If they were Russian agents, they’d have a bit more cash in the bank, she reasoned. Mr Tikhonovski was a leader in protests against closer integration with Russia, and spent 30 days in prison for his trouble: “We know all about Lukashenko’s road maps with Russia, which will slowly but surely lead to full unification. Ask yourself who the pro-Russian candidate really is.”  Ms Tikhanovskaya has grown in self-assurance since the unexpected start to her political career. In conversation with The Independent, she delivers weighted positions that disguise the lack of formal political experience. On Russia, the policy was to be “friends with everyone” – but reduce dependence on oil and gas handouts. On the “painful” subject of Crimea, “de jure” it was Ukrainian, “de facto” Russian, and she wouldn’t drive people further apart by committing to either. She would stay middle of the road on the most controversial social issues like gay marriage: “I’m totally fine with same-sex relations and think any love is wonderful, but perhaps our country isn’t ready for a decision on this just yet.” Ms Tikhanovskaya’s campaign has not shied from taboos. As a registered candidate she was allowed a short broadcast on state TV, and she used it to extraordinary effect. For the first time in many years, viewers were told about political prisoners and arrests. She attacked the president’s Covid-19 denialism and alleged low ratings. Quite how popular the president is is unclear, given that independent polling is illegal in Belarus. One unofficial online poll had him at 3 per cent. That figure is likely to be highly misleading given the president’s historical electoral base. But it has become somewhat of an opposition slogan, and was unwittingly amplified by the president himself when he complained about “3 per cent” Lukashenko jokes. On this, as on much else, the old-fashioned autocrat has found himself behind the curve of modern social media and meme culture. David Marples, a professor at the University of Alberta, Canada, and long time Belarus watcher, suggests that a free vote could be quite evenly split. “Coronavirus and economic problems have conspired to undermine a belief Lukashenko can deliver,” he says. For most of his time in office, the president kept his side of an “unspoken contract” – good pensions and living standards in exchange for political submission. Now, the model is broken. “There is no obvious or honest way for Lukashenko to get the 65 per cent any respectable dictator needs,” Mr Marples says. “It’s the beginning of the end for him – perhaps not in two weeks time, but not far beyond. The fear has gone.” In a sign of increasing nervousness, Belarus’s long time leader has started to to hint at the use of force. On Friday, he said he had “learned the lessons of 2010”, when protests erupted following his claimed overwhelming victory, and were suppressed with the help of riot police. “I understand the need to have well-prepared soldiers ready just in case,” he said. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who has evacuated her children out of Belarus, tells The Independent that there wasn’t a moment where she didn’t feel “very, very frightened”. But it was a fear the whole county shared, she insists. “I hope they will listen to their people – and never, ever send in the tanks or soldiers,” she says. “We don’t want blood, we just want change.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The first day of Eid al-Adha marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah.Due to Islam traditionally using the lunar calendar the date does sht and its not officially on until theres a clear enough sky showing the crescent of a new moon.This means that there is also a day-long iation between countries depending on where they are in the world.In the UK Eid al-Adha  will begin on the evening of Thursday, July , and end on the evening of Monday, August .Eid usually starts with Muslims going to the Mosque for prayers in new finery.As the name would suggest, over the weekend there is usually the sacrice of a sheep, goat, camel or cow. The act is called Qurbani.In the period around Eid al-Adha, many Muslims travel to Mecca and the surrounding area in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.It is a public holiday in traditionally or majority Muslim countries like Indonesia or the United Arab Emirates, but it isnt in more historically Christian countries like the UK.In the UK the animal is slaughtered in a slaughterhouse, but in other countries it is often done as part of a public ritual.It is a time that is spent visiting family and friends, usually involving a big meal and some partying. Kids often get presents too.The meat is shared equally between family, friends and the poor and unlike Eid al-Fitr, the meals made are predominantly savoury. It is a time when they visit family and friends. Muslims will also give money to charity so the less fortunate are also able to celebrate.There are two Eids, which makes things a bit confusing for those not brought up in Islam.Firstly, Eid means feast, so theyre both family gatherings and a good excuse for a party.Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, this year it was in late May, to celebrate the end of fasting.Eid al-Fitr is often referred to as the sweet feast as Muslims will tend to put a greater emphasis on puddings. Eid al-Adha is the one thats coming up this Thursday and is the holier of the two feasts.It coincides with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is around two months after Eid al-Fitr.It is deemed the savoury or salty feast as there is a surplus of meat from the sacrice of the cattle that gets shared around everyone.Eid al-Adha sees the sacrices made as a symbolic act to mimic the near-sacrice of Ibrahimwho agreed to sacrice his son Ishmael when Allah God asked him to in repeated dreams.Ibrahim leads Ishmael to Mount Arafat, tied up his son and stuck a blindfold on so he wouldnt have to watch him suffer. The story goes that Allah replaced Ibrahim with a sheep as Ibrahim blindly flung the kne at his son. Other iations include an angel stepping in at the last moment and giving him a sheep or goat.This is the same story from the Old Testament of Abraham and Isaac.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A source close to German investigators admitted “momentum had been lost” in the probe.German prosecutors had boasted that Christian B was their man and they had #concrete evidence# Madeleine was dead.“In an investigation of this kind the first few weeks after the suspect’s name is released are absolutely vital,” our source told The Sun Online. “Detectives remain convinced Christian B was involved in Madeleine’s disappearance but they still need that crucial part of the jigsaw.#THE prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case was called from a phone linked to a paedophile on the night she vanished.Christian B spent  minutes on the mystery call.A Brit private investigator found the number was once linked to another German paedo.Former cop Mark Williams-Thomas, who exposed Jimmy Savile, said: “It is hugely signicant that a paedophile operating in Germany on the dark web, discussing and exchanging child abuse material, held the number that called B.“It is a huge coincidence that the user is — like B — German and also uses the dark web to discuss the sexual abuse of children.

He just sat around drinking beer.#Police are using tools ranging from excavators, shovels and snfer dogs to investigate the plot.It is now the third day of the search in Seelze, near Hannover, believed to be in connection with the  Portugal disappearance of Madeleine McCann.German police officers were seen leaving the digging site with ground radar specialist equipment.Ground-penetrating radar is an instrument used in order to detect electromagnetic contrasts in the soil.It contains antenna to send and detect electromagnetic waves at given frequencies to detect subsurface objects and changes in material properties.When the energy encounters a buried object or a boundary between materials it can be reflected or scattered back to the surface. Police carry a container towards the site where they started digging in an allotment area in Seelze, near Hannover, Germany.Suspect, Christian B, is said to have lived there for a while some years ago.The plot is four miles from Christian Bs last known fixed address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.The suspect is said to have been living at the site in around  or  in a caravan after ing from Portugal, Haz.de reports.An unnamed source told Bild that Christian B had once lived on the site in a caravan for a short while.One neighbour was said to have recognised him from the photo, and recalled seeing his yellow and white VW Camper van, which German police last month appealed for information on.They added Christian B was often seen with the VW at the allotment where he also had two dogs and where he had often rowed with locals.German police searching a garden today on the outskirts of Hannover, northern Germany, are using excavators, snfer dogs, shovels and rakes to investigate the plot. Investigators put up two tents and continued to dig even further into the ground after they had cut down trees and bushes earlier this week, the German news agency dpa reported.Prosecutors did not say what the investigators were looking for. At the garden plot, investigators even removed parts of the foundation of a former cabin from the ground that once stood there, dpa reported. A man on a neighbouring plot told the news agency that the garden, where blackberry bushes and a cheery tree grow, had not been used for the last two years.The site was previously home to a German suspect linked to Madeleines disappearance.

A spokeswoman for the Braunschweig prosecutors office only said Tuesday that the investigation on the site was connected to their investigation regarding Madeleine. The prime suspect in Madeleine McCanns disappearance exploited the EUs open borders to evade justice, judges were told.The claims came when Christian Bs lawyer appeared at the European Court of Justice to argue he should be freed from jail on a technicality over his conviction for a rape in Portugal.Friedrich Fulscher said it was “unconstitutional” his client had been tried for the sex attack in Praia da Luz on a -year-old woman as it breached international law.The rape occurred in , which was two years before the Brit youngster disappeared while holiday with her family in the resort.Fulscher said last week that Christian B should not have been put on trial as the charge was not part of the arrest warrants issued to extradite him from Portugal to Germany in  and Italy to Germany in . EU law states that people extradited on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant can only be prosecuted for crimes listed in the paperwork.Christian B is currently jailed in Kiel in Northern Germany.Lawyers for the German government argue he has no right to challenge his arrest and say he “made the most of open European borders.”Felix Halabi told the court: “He flouted the rules. Despite the requirement to stay in the national territory  he did not stay, he left for Italy.“In the case we are looking at the suspect made the most of open European borders.”On May , , Madeleine McCann, three, vanished from her bedroom in the apartment her family were staying in at the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal while her parents, Kate and Gerry, ate with friends at a nearby restaurant.The apartment was broken into while Madeleine and her twin baby siblings were asleep, and local police concluded it was a kidnapping.The family voiced concern at what they called was a slow initial police response and a failure to secure the crime scene.In the following days, the McCanns turned to the media to help locate their daughter, and the case attracted global attention with soccer stars David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo joining the appeals for information.The media focus on the case led to reported sightings of Madeleine across the globe. However, the early investigation by Portuguese police produced no major leads.The following July, the Portuguese police dropped their investigation because of a lack of evidence.In , the British police began their own investigation – Operation Grange – saying they had identied  potential suspects.Later that year, they released an e-fit image of a number of men, including one of an unidentied suspect they particularly wanted to trace.Soon after, Portuguese prosecutors ordered the case to be reopened by local police.The new inquiry led Portuguese police to interview four suspects, but they were later cleared of any involvement, and a search by British detectives of wasteland near Praia da Luz also failed to provide a breakthrough.In June , British and German police said they had identied a new suspect in the case, a -year-old German man.Prime suspect Christian B lived in the Algarve between  and  and burgled hotels and holiday flats as well as trading drugs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged.

Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask.

German researchers now claim they have trained dogs who can also detect coronavirus from someones saliva. The potentially ground-breaking study was piloted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover, the Hanover Medical School and the German Armed Forces.They found that,properly trained, dogs were able to discriminate between human saliva samples infected with SARS-CoV- and non-infected samples with a whopping success rate of  per cent overall.There is hope that this could help prevent further outbreaks due to the rapid nature of the testing. It could also lead to instant testing at sporting events and airports, allowing countries to scrap some quarantining measures and empty stadium rules.To conduct the study, researchers trained eight dogs from Germanys Armed Forces for one week. The trained canines snfed the saliva of more than , people that were either healthy or infected with the virus. Samples infected with Covid- were distributed at random and neither the animal handlers nor the researchers on site knew which ones were positive.In a Youtube video on the project, Maren von Koeckritz-Blickwede, a professor at the university who conducted the study, says researchers think dogs can do this because the internal processes of an infected person completely change.She said: We think that the dogs are able to detect a specic smell of the metabolic changes that occur in those patients.Ms Von Koeckritz-Blickwede says the next step is to train dogs to dferentiate Covid- samples from other diseases like the flu, while other research will also need to be carried out. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while dogs can get infected with Covid-, there is no evidence that animals play a signicant role in spreading the virus.The study was published in BMC Infectious Diseases on July .

What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people.The Spanish flu pandemic - the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history - emerged in March  with the hallmarks of a seasonal virus.As it coincided with the First World War, the virus spread through army troops from across the globe.  Cases appeared to drop off over the summer - and there was hope at the beginning of August  that the virus had run its course.But from September to November of that year, the death rate skyrocketed and unlike the first wave, this strain affected young, healthy people too.Experts describe it as W curve - where there are high numbers of deaths among the very young and old, as well as a huge spike in the middle, with otherwise healthy  to -year-olds being struck down.The pandemic ended by the summer of , as those had been infected around the world had either died or developed immunity, according to History.In , scientists revealed that they had solved the mystery of how the Spanish started and why it became so deadly.A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people born after  had not been exposed to the kind of virus which devastated the world in .This explains why the deadly pandemic largely targeted young adults while older patients, who had built up some immunity, would often make a full recovery, reports National Geographic.Prof Kirby stressed that people who are overweight may also be at a higher risk of a second wave of coronavirus.He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.Earlier this week, the Government announced its strategy to tackling the obesity crisis in the UK.The new “Better Health” campaign, run by Public Health England, calls on everyone to “embrace a healthier lestyle”.Supported by the NHS, the scheme will allow GPs to refer more patients to the likes of WeightWatchers.GPs will also prescribe exercise, such as cycling and gym classes, and patients will be given access to weight loss apps.Staff in doctors’ surgeries will also be trained as “healthy weight coaches” to give people advice on how to stay trim.Meanwhile, shops will be banned from offering Buy One Get One Free deals on junk food and placing treats near store entrances and tills.Large restaurants, cafes and takeaways must put calorie labels on menus, so customers can make informed choices.And adverts for food high in fat, sugar or salt will be axed from TV and websites before the pm watershed.Ministers will consult on expanding this to cover all times of day and night.Health charities last night welcomed the “world-leading” plans.But critics said it will push up food prices and see cash-strapped families losing out on supermarket bargains.Evidence of a link between obesity and increased risk from Covid was a “wake-up call” to ministers.Mr Johnson has lost over a stone by exercising and watching his food since his brush with the virus. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Spain the number of cases has shot up, forcing the UK to reimpose  daysapos quarantine on anyone who s from there.  Itaposs not quite the same picture in England, where as far as the figures show, thereaposs been no huge rise. But just as pubs, cafes, hairdressers and gyms reopen, there have been worrying local outbreaks in Oldham, Luton, Blackburn, Leicester and more. And across England as a whole, a steady fall in the number of new cases has now levelled off. According to one measure, the number of positive tests each day has risen % since the start of the month.That will worry many people as more rules are lted on August  - with people in England encouraged to go back to work, and the vulnerable no longer needing to shield. So what do the statistics say  We look a few of the figures that will be worrying the PM - and the nation. Boris Johnson said yesterday: Clearly we now face, Iaposm afraid, the threat of a second wave in other parts of Europe and we just have to be vigilant and we have to be very mindful.A Downing Street source later told the Daily Mail : The PM is extremely concerned by what heaposs seeing abroad and fears we could be seeing the same thing here in a fortnight.A No spokesman declined to comment today on the report in the Mail. But askedthere could be a second wave in the UK in two weeks, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast: There is always a risk. We have been clear all along that there is a risk. Hereaposs why they could be worried. . New case numbers are no longer falling in England  The number of new coronavirus cases is no longer falling in England, official figures showed on Friday. The Office for National Statistics announced a steady decline in number of people testing positive for Covid- over recent months has now levelled off.The watchdog estimated that in the week to July , around one in , people in had coronavirus in the community in England. The previous weekaposs bulletin put the figure at one in ,.And there were an estimated , new cases per day, compared with , the previous week.The ONS stopped short of saying cases actually rose - because each weekaposs statistics cannot be directly compared. There are also very high levels of uncertainty, because the ONS is uses a model to estimateallcoronavirus cases in England - not just people who test positive.We explain the separate data on people testing positive below.  The number of people testing positive for Covid- in England has been slowly creeping up for weeks. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in England had fallen to  on July , the lowest since March. But since then the number has gradually ticked up and hit  on July  - a rise of %. The data, issued by Public Health England, could of course be due to more people getting tested for coronavirus - therefore more people testing positive. But whatever the cause, it shows confirmed cases are certainly not levelling off below , and could indicate rises or outbreaks in parts of the nation. The Daily Mail reports there has been an even higher % rise in new cases over a similar period. We used Public Health Englandaposs recommended method to calculate the number of new cases per day - looking at the dates tests were taken, not the date the results came back. But both methods - ours and the Mailaposs - show a steady rise in confirmed cases. For comparison, the rolling average of confirmed cases hit a peak of , on April . . Cases have surged in Oldham - and itaposs only one area where there are problems  Oldham, Greater Manchester, was the latest council yesterday to announce local restrictions after a coronavirus outbreak. It followed Leicester, Luton and Blackburn, all of which have barred residents from exiting lockdown at the same speed as the rest of England. The figures in Oldham show just how quickly the virus can spread. The council saw  cases in the week to  July - up % from  the week before. In Blackburn, the number of new people testing positive per , residents rose from  to  to  over the most recent three weeks. Over the same three-week period in Luton, the number of new positive tests per , residents rose from  to . Spain has been an example to the rest of Europe of how quickly a second wave could descend from where in Europe. The number of Covid- cases in Spain being reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control almost doubled last week. The public health body registered , cases in the week to July  and , in the week to July . While the figures canapost be directly compared to the UKaposs - for example, they record zero Spanish cases on weekends - they were worrying enough for the UK to clamp down with new rules on quarantine. Boris Johnson said: Letaposs be absolutely clear about whataposs happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends.Iaposm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic. Spainaposs PM Pedro Sanchez has insisted the outbreaks are confined to particular regions, claiming most of Spain has case numbers lower than in the UK. .

And after just a few weeks of residents enjoying visitors to their home and apossocial bubblesapos, they have now been banned.The boroughaposs , residents must also keep two metres apart from friends and family when seeing them outside, the Manchester Evening News reports.From Friday, vulnerable and elderly people who have been shielding are now being asked to continue to do so for another two weeks. Ed and Ann Jones, from Lees, said that people in Oldham should have followed the rules to begin with. I thought itaposd be over by now, Ed sighed, If people had obeyed the rules to begin with, weaposd be all right now. People havenapost been doing it, -year-old Ann said.  Like with the raves that theyaposve had. I donapost think the younger ones understand how itaposs actually affecting people. I didnapost go in a supermarket from March for three months. The only people Iaposve had round is my son and my daughter. The couple questioned why the council couldnapost impose the measures on specic parts of Oldham, rather than the entire town. It would make sense to lockdown the area where these cases are rising, Oldham is a big place, Ann added. That way youaposd know who is breaking the rules.  Oldham Council said a signicant proportion of recent cases involve multiple people testing positive in a single household. Town hall chiefs said that shows household spread is a real issue - especially in cases in which large families live together in one home. If youaposve got a big family and youaposre all under one roof itaposs really hard not to mingle with other people, Ed added. The tougher guidelines are aimed at avoiding a full government-mandated local lockdown like the one that has taken place in Leicester.  In the seven days to July  there have been  new cases of the virus in Oldham. This is more than a fourfold increase from the previous week, ending July , which saw  positive cases. Just four days ago, the government had dropped the borough from its watch list of areas of concern due to a fall in the infection rate. As part of the guidelines, people are being urged to wear a mask when they cannot guarantee being able to stay two metres apart, such as in shops and on public transport.  But local business owner Pauline Jackson, who runs a shop which specialises in shoe repairs and key cutting, said masks should have been compulsory from day one. I think people would rather stay at home now than wear a mask, she said. I think from day one when shops were allowed to open that masks should have been compulsory to everybody. I think wearing the masks should have come out right at the beginning.  The -year-old from Chadderton said the lockdown has had a huge impact on her business. Weaposre not on our own, everybody is exactly the same. It hasnapost picked up, she said. We do rely on the elderly age group and theyaposre not coming out. With the elderly and vulnerable having to stay in again for two weeks that will massively impact the business.  I think itaposs going to have a very big impact on us all. Barbara Davidson has been visiting her daughter Angela and grandchildren since the lockdown measures were eased earlier this month. Shopping in the town centre with her daughter she asked: So are we doing something illegal now by being together  Itaposs a big change for peopleall of a suddengoes back to a lockdown, she added.  June Brooks from Hathershaw has been visiting her son every Tuesday. The -year-old said sheaposs not surprised the cases are rising. But Marie, a carer from Springhead, said she was shocked to hear about the new, tougher restrictions. I havenapost really noticed anyone not following the rules, but town today seems quite busy really, she said.  It is a worry when the cases are rising quite signicantly. Iqbal, a taxi driver in Oldham, said the tougher restrictions will impact his familyaposs Eid celebrations on Friday. Itaposs like our Christmas, he said. Weaposve just been getting things back to normal.  The mosques have opened up again and people are coming and going, so it will be back to square one again. Youaposve just got to be careful, check your temperatures, make sure nobody has been in contact with anyone and just be careful. It will affect Eid because itaposs a big gathering so I donapost know how itaposs going to work out. All the family usually gets together. Deputy council leader and cabinet member for COVID- recovery Arooj Shahsaid the best way to avoid infection is limiting contact with others and staying home wherever you can, including working from home where possible.  She urged people to meet in groups of no more than six people from dferent households when outside, and said gatherings larger than six should only take placeeveryone is exclusively from two households or support bubbles. It is against the law for gatherings of more than  people to take place in private homes, including gardens and other outdoor spaces, and for a range of other events, including weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and services, community activities and support groups the government advice is the same, Cllr Shah added. Earlier this month, it was announced that the borough had been chosen as one of four pilot sites in the country testing people who do not have symptoms of coronavirus. Katrina Stephens, director of public health for Oldham, urged anyone with symptoms to book a coronavirus test online.

Meghan is suing Associated Newspapers Limitedafter it published parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father Thomas in August . The case continued today as her legal team bid to keep the identities of friends, who gave an interview to People magazine in February last year, secret in reports of the proceedings. In the People article, the friends spoke out against the bullying Meghan said she has faced, and have only been identied in confidential court documents. The duchess, , says her friends gave the interview without her knowledge, and denies a claim made by ANL that she caused or permitted the People article to be published.  In court documents for the hearing, before Mr Justice Warby, Meghanaposs lawyers argued that the friends - referred to as A to E - have a right to anonymity both as confidential journalistic sources and under their own privacy rights. Justin Rushbrooke QC, representing the duchess, said in written submissions to the court: To force the claimant, as the defendant urges this court to do, to disclose their identities to the public at this stage would be to exact an unacceptably high price for pursuing her claim for invasion of privacy against the defendant in respect of its disclosure of the letter. On her case, which will be tried in due course, the defendant has been guilty of a flagrant and unjustied intrusion into her private and family le. Given the close factual nexus between the letter and the events leading up to the defendantaposs decision to publish its contents, it would be a cruel irony were she required to pay that price before her claim has even been determined.  Mr Rushbrooke added: The friends are not parties to this action, but unwilling participants. At this early stage of the litigation it cannot be said with certainty that they would be witnesses at the trial. He told the court that ANLaposs case is that Meghan had compromised her friendsapos right to privacy by putting their names into a public court document. He said: We say, on any analysis, that is actually a grotesque perversion of whataposs actually happened. Mr Rushbrooke added: It is bad enough that the position was taken in correspondence, but it is disappointing to see it persisted with in written submissionsput before the court. The true position is, let there be no doubt about it, that the claimant has done nothing of the sort. It was the defendant who made the interviews with People relevant.  It was the defendant who forced the claimant to identy the names of the five friends in a court document by serving a request for further information that required those names to be given and, for her part, we submit that the claimant has done what she reasonably and sensibly could to protect their confidentiality and privacy rights. Meghanaposs lawyers also argue that Associated Newspapers has already demonstrated a willingness to publish articles based on the contents of court documents. Mr Rushbrooke added: There can be little doubt that, in addition to defending this case through the courts, the defendant is seeking to maximise the publicity surrounding this case, which it has repeatedly dubbed aposthe trial of the centuryapos. ANLaposs lawyers are resisting the application to keep the identities of Meghanaposs friends secret, claiming the duchessaposs friends brought the letter into the public domain when it was referred to for the first time in the People interview. In written submissions, Anthony White QC, acting for ANL, said: The friends are important potential witnesses on a key issue. Reporting these matters without referring to names would be a heavy curtailment of the mediaaposs and the defendantaposs entitlement to report this case and the publicaposs right to know about it.  No friendaposs oral evidence could be fully and properly reported because full reporting might identy her, especially as there has already been media speculation as to their identities. Mr White also said the present order sought by the duchessaposs lawyers would leave Meghan entitled to disclose the identities to anyone - including the media - who could publish it, while ANLaposs titles would remain barred from doing so. In a witness statement submitted as part of the application, Meghan said: Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, is threatening to publish the names of five women - five private citizens - who made a choice on their own to speak anonymously with a US media outlet more than a year ago, to defend me from the bullying behaviour of Britainaposs tabloid media. These five women are not on trial, and nor am I. The publisher of the Mail on Sunday is the one on trial.  It is this publisher that acted unlawfully and is attempting to evade accountability, to create a circus and distract from the point of this case - that the Mail on Sunday unlawfully published my private letter.

Maggie Munro, aged , fractured her femur at the Silver Sands beach in Aberdour, Fe, during a day out with her family - with the dogs running off their leads. The unfortunate child must now spend up to two months in a hip to toe cast, but despite the incident sheaposs still desperate for a pet dog of her own.The Edinburgh girl is recovering well at home and her parents have issued a warning to dog owners to be more careful in public places, reports the Daily Record. They fear it was only luck which meant the situation wasnapost any worse for little Maggie, with the dogs only just missing her baby sister Molly. Mum Mhairi, , said: It was two dogs owned by two dferent owners and they were just playing and excited to see each other, but they basically ran full tilt and took Maggie out and skittled her. They just skfed our nine-month-old who was sitting down by my feet at the time.  I did not notice them coming straight towards us and it all happened in a flash. I scooped Maggie up and when I tried to put her back down on the sand, the minute her foot was on it I knew that was not possible, so I carried her off the sand to a grassy area and bench where my brother was sitting. Mhairi said one of the dog owners came over to see how Maggie was but the owners of the other dog appeared to have disappeared without an apology after the incident. Paramedics moved Maggie onto a stretcher and drove her to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, where she had the bone realigned and was put in a cast. X-rays taken at the time showed a clean break of Maggieaposs left femur bone just a few centimetres above the knee cap. Dad Gregor added: Should your dog be running around at full tilt when other people are around  Maybe owners should rein them in around kids. These were decent sized dogs going at high speed and, in some way, itaposs lucky Molly did not bear the brunt because the situation could have been worse.

Phoebe fell while visiting the Ceunant Mawr Waterfall in Llanberis on the edge of popular tourist destination Snowdonia. The six-year-old was pulled over the edge of the waterfall and down into the pool below, where thankfully a stranger managed to save her.She was left with just minor bruising and a scrape, the BBC reported.Phoebeaposs motheraposs partner Liam Bolland jumped into the water to try to save her before she was sucked away by the current. He was taking photos from the waterfallaposs viewing area when he heard a aposhorrible, horrible screamapos from his partner.  Liam spun round to see a look of terror on his partneraposs face, who then told him Phoebe was in the water.  Despite not being able to see her beneath the bubbling water he launched himself into the pool, only to be hit by its breathtaking coldness. Liam explained how he struggled to reach her while keeping himself above the water, before hearing Phoebe tumble over the edge. I could hear the screaming from my partner and son and the water bashing down next to me, he told The BBC.  Liam managed to pull himself up out of the water using some roots. While he did, other family members began shouting down to people by the lower pool where the water lands. One man managed to throw himself into the water and pull the young girl out.  While she was in a state of shock she was mercully unharmed. She is an amazing little girl, Liam said. She has a couple of small bruises and a bit of a scrape on her arm. Phoebe was taken by ambulance to Bangoraposs Ysbyty Gwynedd to be checked over. Liam thanked and hugged the man who saved her. In the days since the accident the family have revisited the waterfall to try and work out what happened.  It is unclear how Phoebe, who was standing a couple of feet from her mum, tumbled into the water. Liam has called for the area to be assessed for safety. Gwynedd council said warning signs were already in place. A member of Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team was near the waterfall when the incident unfolded. A spokesman for the group said: The Good Samaritan who entered the bottom pool was a very strong swimmer and used to cold water, they did however, experience the effects of cold water shock with a noticeable reduction in muscle power.

The convicted sex offender reportedly had no interest in growing vegetables but lounged around drinking beer and told people he was a car mechanic while living in a van. The gazebo has since been destroyed but German media reports today that police digging up the site have found the cellar and are searching it for evidence about Madeleineaposs disappearance.

But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations.He said the buildings on Brueckneraposs plot of land were demolished in . He added that Brueckner would talk of his preference for southern Europe due to the climate and that the rapist had a VW Transporter van and parked it next to the allotment and lived in the vehicle.

German detectives have not saidthey are looking for Madeleineaposs remains or simply evidence against Brueckner. German prosecutors have said they believe the missing youngster, who vanished from her Portuguese hotel room in , is dead. Police in Portugal have also renewed search efforts based on reports that the German suspect stayed in the area in a beat-up RV at the time Madeleine went missing. They have unsuccessfully searched around  wells for human remains. Mr Kossak said that Brueckner disappeared in  and he never saw him again.  German media says he received at least two criminal convictions from a Hanover court, one for forging documents in  and another for theft in .    He split his time between Germany and Portugal from  to , prosecutors in Hanover have said.

Police remain at the private garden which is thought to have once been owned by convicted sex offender Christian Brueckner where he may have once lived.Detectives have discovered and searched the cellar of a gazebo which had once stood at the vegetable garden, according to German media.This morning ground-penetrating radar equipment arrived at the site, which is near Hanover in Germany. Forensic specialists with snfer dogs were seen in the garden and authorities were using large earth-moving machinery to dig up the entire backyard, according to local news reports. Locals have described the search as ominous and there have been reports in local media that Brueckner may have lived at the allotment in a gazebo-style building.  Brueckner - who is currently in jail in northern Germany - is suspected of killing Madeleine after she vanished from her Praia da Luz holiday apartment in May , the same year that Brueckner lived at the allotment.  Asked by Bild about Brueckneraposs connection to the allotment, the suspectaposs lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher said he could not comment on the police operation.Pressed on why the allotment was being searched, Fuelscher told the newspaper that I think weaposll find out the reason soon.One local claimed the German ­paedophile lived at the ­allotment site for a short while.

There are strict rules governing the private allotments, people are not allowed to sleep overnight in the huts, which are hired out to city dwellers wanting a country escape.  I can confirm that the search is in connection with our Maddie McCann investigation, Julia Meyer, the spokeswoman for the prosecution told Euronews this week. Police erected a temporary fence around the site after they started their search at dawn, meaning they could only be seen through some trees. Some wore forensic suits and others used rakes and shovels to comb the area. Trees were cut down to assist the search, while several police vehicles were parked outside. Detectives have not saidthey are looking for Madeleineaposs remains or simply evidence against Brueckner.

The Department for Transport has launched a consultation which could see changes in the driveraposs rule book including making it clear where cyclists and pedestrians have priority or aposright of wayapos over drivers. The plan is trying to improve safety for pedestrians - in particular for children, older adults and disabled people. There would be new rules around what to do when you see someone waiting to cross the road as well as how drivers should deal with cyclists at junctions. Cyclists will be given clearer priority at junctions, and pedestrians clearer priority when crossing or waiting to cross the road. There would also be mention of the Dutch Reach - a method for opening your car door without endangering cyclists - as well as making sure warning sounds are working on electric cars and making sure your charging cable is not a trip hazard.  The main alterations to the code being proposed, as reported by Cornwall Live, are: Introducing a hierarchy of road users which ensures that those road users who can do the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the danger or threat they may pose to others Clarying existing rules on pedestrian priority on pavements, to advise that drivers and riders should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross the road Providing guidance on cyclist priority at junctions to advise drivers to give priority to cyclists at junctions when travelling straight ahead Establishing guidance on safe passing distances and speeds when overtaking cyclists and horse riders. The plan reads: The consultation document is seeking views on proposed changes to The Highway Code to improve safety for pedestrians, particularly children, older adults and disabled people, cyclists and horse riders. It is important that these groups feel safe in their interactions with other road users. The document says it gives: specic consideration on overtaking, passing distances, cyclist and pedestrian priority at junctions, opening vehicle doors and responsibility of road users. The changes would be made to a number of sections of the Highway Code including:Rules for pedestriansRules about animalsRules for cyclistsRules for drivers and motorcyclistsGeneral rules, techniques and advice for all drivers and ridersUsing the roadRoad users requiring extra careWaiting and parkingAnnex : you and your bicycle Annex : vehicle maintenance, safety and security. Discussing the planned new Hierarchy of Road Users the plan reads: The ‘Hierarchy of Road Users’ is a concept which places those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the hierarchy. The road users most likely to be injured in the event of a collision are pedestrians, in particular children, older adults and disabled people, followed by cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists. The hierarchy does not remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly. The following H rules clary this concept. It is important that ALL road users are aware of The Highway Code, are considerate to other road users and understand their responsibility for the safety of others. It adds: Those in charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to others. This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, followed by vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles. Cyclists, horse riders and horse drawn vehicles likewise have a responsibility to reduce danger to pedestrians. Always remember that the people you encounter may have impaired sight, hearing or mobility, and may not be able to see or hear you. None of this detracts from the responsibility of all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders, to have regard for their own and other road users’ safety.  There would be new rules around what to do when you see someone waiting to cross the road. They would read: At a junction you should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross a road into which or from which you are turning. You MUST give way to pedestrians on a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists on a parallel crossing. You should give way to pedestrians waiting to cross a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists waiting to cross a parallel crossing. Horse riders and horse drawn vehicles should also give way to pedestrians on a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists on a parallel crossing. Pedestrians have priority when on a zebra crossing, on a parallel crossing or at light controlled crossings when they have a green signal. Cyclists should give way to pedestrians on shared use cycle tracks. Only pedestrians may use the pavement. This includes people using wheelchairs and mobility scooters.

I’m not aware of any set-up pictures being done with Meghan.”, reports the Sun. While living in Canada, Meghan is also said to have become close to celebrity photographer George Pimentel. George, who travelled to England to get shots of Meghan on her wedding day, previously said in  that she tried to promote herself in any way she could from the start.He added that Meghan struck gold with Prince Harry and that she aposlives for taking on the huge role as being married to Harryapos.

But according to new book Finding Freedom, the couple felt her words lacked warmth and believed it showed she wasnapost happy with their choice.  Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: [Meghan and Harry] had seen a draft of what Buckingham Palace planned to put out in a statement that would follow theirs and its lack of warmth was a clear sign that not everyone supported their decision. On January , Meghan and Harry shared their -word statement that would change their lives forever. They said they had spend months thinking about the move, and wanted to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.  However they said they planned to continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen and to raise Archie with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born.Shortly after their message went live, the Queenaposs office shared a statement, which said they understood Meghan and Harryaposs desire to take a dferent approach, but warned it will take time to work out the details.It read: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.  A palace source has told the BBC that senior members of the Royal Family feel hurt by the announcement. Following a series of debates and discussions, including a crisis meeting attended by the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, she released a further message, in which she broke tradition and used the coupleaposs first names rather than their official titles. She wrote: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.

Lissie Harper had been married to PC Harper for just a month when he was killed by Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , as they tried to steal a quad bike. PC Harper, , was dragged for more than a mile along the country lanes of Berkshire when he became entangled in a tow rope attached to the teenagersapos getaway car. An Old Bailey jury acquitted all three defendants of murder on Friday, instead convicting Cole and Bowers of manslaughter. Long had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.In an open letter posted on her Facebook page on Tuesday evening, Mrs Harper wrote to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Lord Blunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country. She wrote: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be. The original trial was abandoned on the day the country went into lockdown in March, while for the retrial Mr Justice Edis ordered extra security measures amid fears of potential juror intimidation.  A female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining  started deliberating on their verdicts after she was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the teenagers in the dock. The defendants hugged each other after the verdicts were ed following more than  hours of deliberations. Speaking outside court, Mrs Harper thanked the police and prosecution who had stood in our corner and fought to make sure these men were made to repent for their barbaric crimes.

Royal commentator Katie Nicholl said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are not raising the seven-year-old to be spoilt or get special treatment but there is one telltale sign that he is the future king. Katie, who is the author of William And Harry: Behind The Palace Wall, claims Prince George is often singled out to spend more time with the Queen.Speaking to OK! she said his future as a king is being introduced to him gradually by William and Kate.She said: “George is an absolute pleasure to be around and that’s down to his parents. They want to protect him from that moment, so it’s an idea that’s being introduced to him gradually. The true enormity of what his le will one day be isn’t something he’s fully aware of yet. George gets taken away from his sister Princess Charlotte, five, and brother Prince Louis, two, for photoshoots with his dad, granddad and great-gran which Katie said he will have noticed. Footage was filmed of George learning how to make Christmas puddings alongside his father, grandfather Charles and the monarch for the Queenaposs Christmas Day message in . In January a photo was released of George with the Queen and her son and grandson.  “I think George understands, like William did from a very early age, that he’s dferent from his younger brother and sister and that he’ll have a dferent future, Katie said. “After all, he gets taken away to do photoshoots with Her Majesty the Queen, so he must notice he’s been singled out. “But I don’t think William and Kate have made a big thing of saying to George, ‘One day you will be King. “They’re not raising him to be spoilt or to have an inflated sense of his own importance. He doesn’t get special treatment just because he’s the future heir.  She said that it is believed William and Kate chose Thomas’s Battersea for Prince Georgeaposs early years of schooling because of its nurturing environment and the focus on “being kind”. “There was quite a big fuss about George’s arrival at the school. Bulletproof glass was installed and the presence of protection officers sets him apart from his peers, she said. His classmates were clearly very aware there was something dferent about him from the start. They know he’s a prince and they call him ‘PG’, which is short for Prince George.” Katie said the relaxed approach to preparing Prince George for his future could be down to how William felt as teenager when he was troubled by the sense of duty that awaited him.She said: “As a young man, William really struggled with that notion of kingship. The realisation that he had no choice about which path his le would take, that he couldn’t become a doctor or a vethe chose, weighed very heavily on him. “He got treated dferently from his younger brother. When the boys went for tea with the Queen Mother, William would get the first choice of sandwiches or cake. It was all about William. I think that’s why Diana overcompensated in terms of her affection for Harry because she was very aware that he didn’t get the same attention William got.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family newsletter must read","story":"NewsRoyal family newsletter - the must-read email with all the days royal headlinesThe Mirrors Royal Family newsletter will bring the most important and interesting stories on the Queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, William, Harry and the rest of the Firm straight to your inboxShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJust put your email address in the box underneath this picture and we will start sending you our royal newsletter \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

David Price has devised the aposSafety Pouchapos so motorists no longer have to rummage in their glove compartment to find their licence during a traffic stop. The -year-old, who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, came up with the idea after a number of drivers were shot by police who thought they were reaching for a gun when they were pulled over. He toldhe hopes his invention will save lives. David said: When I got my drivers licence my parents sat me down and had a chat with me about the dos and donapostsI was pulled over by the cops including making sure the officers can see my moments. There have been incidents where drivers were shot because cops saw them going into their glove box and thought they were going to pull out a gun. When you reach for something it puts the traffic cops on edge as they donapost knowyou are reaching for the licence or for your gun. Police will shoot eventhere is a baby in the car. David, a political science student, said the idea first popped into his head during a class where they were tasked with inventing a product that could change society.He recalled the death of Philando Castile who was shot by a police officer in his car in St Paul, Minnesota, in July . His four-year-old daughter and fiancée Diamond Reynolds were in the car when he was fired at six times.In a Facebook live video during the aftermath, David said Philando was shot as he reached for his driving licence.People were angry when Philando died, he said. He was simply trying to get his licence when he was killed in front of his partner and daughter.  The pouch has a large clip that is attached to the sun visor so when a driver is pulled over by police they are able to pull it off and attach it to their window. When I presented my pouch to my professor he loved it, David said. He told me to make it into a real project so I have worked on it since then and Iaposm in the process of patenting it. The pouch has also been designed with a clear cover on the front so police can see the driveraposs credentials and check whether they have a disability.  David said: If someone has a physical or mental impairment such as being deaf the officer can see straight away and they are aware. I worked closely with several police officers to perfect the pouch and they all love it and say itaposs a really good thing. While drivers fear they could be shot the cops also have no idea what is going to happen when they approach a car so this is reassuring for both parties. The pouch comes in one colour only - a vibrant shade of orange - David said this is on purpose.  It is a distinctive colour so cops will be able to spot it and know its a safety pouch, he said. As more people use the safety pouch itaposll become more well known. It also comes with a sticker that drivers can display at the back of their car so police know they use a safety pouch. My mum and dad are so proud of me and everyone I tell about it say itaposs a great invention as it could save lives.  Through word of mouth David has already sold , pre-ordered pouches pending the patent being granted.His customers include Tina Lawson, the mum of American singer Beyonce. Tina posted photos of the pouch on Instagram urging her million followers to buy them for drivers in their family.She said: I am purchasing several for my nieces and nephew all of my bonus sons and daughters.  I pray for the day when we won’t need this pouch that we can reach in our glove compartment to get out a registration or insurance papers! Right now though it’s a good thing to have. As soon as you are stopped you take your pouch and put it in the window for the officer to retrieve it , so that you can keep your hands on the steering wheel.

Bartender Neil Harkin and his date Jean McAuley, , had booked a table at The Old Docks Bar and Grill in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and were quietly enjoying each otheraposs company at their table, when their love le was thrust into the limelight. Restaurant owner Liam Shiels, , decided to prank his friend Neil, , by sitting them in the middle of the room, before joining  other friends to watch as the stunt unfolded. Liam organised a bottle of bubbly to be sent over to their table with a huge sparkler - making it look like they had just got engaged. The clip shows the couple squirming in embarrassment as the entire restaurant watches, whilst a fizzing indoor sparkler is brought over to their table. The extravagant delivery made it look like the couple were celebrating their engagement or even news of a baby - when in fact it was their first romantic night out ever. Neil, from Derry, Northen Ireland, said: There was nothing I could do. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me.  Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. We didnapost expect anything at all. The restaurant was packed - there wasnapost a [free] seat in the whole restaurant. Being a friend, Liam knew it was a first date so thataposs when he started his prank. As they say, the rest is history. A customer had a birthday so I thought they were going to do something [to say] happy birthday. We were sitting there having a meal and then the next thing a bottle of Prosecco came down with a sparkler on it. Prankster Liam, also from Londonderry, said: It was priceless - unbelievable. The whole place was clapping and cheering.  He text me on the Friday to book a table in the restaurant so I said aposIaposll get you squeezed inapos. We were there for a leaving do too. When they walked in he was expecting everyone to be cheering but we just said aposalright, how are you doing apos We had it arranged that weaposd put them in the middle table in the whole restaurant. When they were just finishing dinner we got the staff to get a bottle of Prosecco with a sparkler on the top of it, then played aposCongratulationsapos music around the speakers. We couldnapost stop laughing. You can hear the laughs in the background. There were  of us out and there was a few people videoing it.  Once the prank was over and dusted the couple joined Liam for a drink after their date - and Jean even agree to see him again, despite how mortied she was. Liam said: The two of them took it so, so well. The craic was great. The girl he was out with grabbed a glass and poured herself a drink. It ended well because they joined us for a drink later on that night. Neil, who has known his date since primary school, had no idea of how his night would unfold, instead presuming the music was for someone having a birthday. Neil said: This was a first date, but me and Jean went to the same primary school. Iaposve known her a long time then we hooked up and went on a date.

Nicole Hennessy, a mum-of-three, has more than , followers on TikTok, and regularly shares content of her kids, including her -year-old daughter who is seven months pregnant. Nicoleaposs followers were keen to find out more about her daughteraposs pregnancy, so after asking for her permission, she got the green light to share her story to TikTok in the hopes it would raise awareness about the topic. In the clip, instead of condemning her daughter, she educated her on the three options she had, which was greeted with a lot of praise from users for her supportive parenting style. In the clip she reenacts the very moment that she knew that her daughter was pregnant. She found a corner of a pregnancy test wrapper on the floor of the bathroom - a dead give away. Nicole then went to ask her daughter whether the test was hers.  Her daughter reassured her that the test was negative and not to worry, and headed off to school for the day. But Nicoleaposs gut instinct told her to buy a second test just in case. When her daughter got home from school that day she asked her to take the other test - it came back positive. Nicole said that her daughter was confused and visibly upset, so she suggested three options she could take. She could either continue with the pregnancy, have an abortion or arrange an adoption. Her daughter decided to keep the baby and is currently seven months pregnant as viewers can see in Nicoleaposs other videos.

For years, Japanaposs north coast had been the site of the disturbing phenomenon, with rickety fishing vessels arriving more than ,km from where they set out. In  the numbers were unprecedented with more than  damaged boats landing, containing a total of  bodies, compared to  vessels the year before. Some have speculated the weather that year was to blame and that North Koreaaposs aging fishing population had something to do with the problem. But a study by non-profit Global Fishing Watch and published today in journal Science Advances has been able to shed some light on the matter. Researchers used satellite technologies to analyse marine traffic in northeast Asia in  and , and discovered hundreds of dark fishing fleets - believed to be Chinese - have been operating in North Korean waters - apparently illegally. This meant ushering out North Korean boats and forcing them on ill-advised ventures into Russian and Japanese waters, poorly equipped for long distance travel.For foreigners, fishing in waters off the North Korean coast or trading fish caught there internationally is against the law - but it doesnapost appear to have deterred the huge swathes of rogue ships, according to the report. The paperaposs authors estimate in  and  alone these ships caught more than , metric tons of Pacic flying squid, a particularly valuable seafood - worth £ million. Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and co-lead author of the study, said: It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by vessels originating from one country operating in another nationaposs waters. Another author, Jungsam Lee, said the North Korean vesselsapos decision to try their luck in distant foreign waters would have proved catastrophic for many of the fisherman.  It is too dangerous for them to work in the same waters as the Chinese trawlers, he explained. Thataposs why theyaposre pushed to work in Russian and Japanese waters and that explains why some of North Koreaaposs damaged vessels showed up on the beaches of Japan. Northeast Asiaaposs waters are some of the most contested seas in the world, but fish stocks are in dramatic decline. The Pacic flying squid stocks have dropped  per cent in South Korean waters and  per cent Japanese waters since , according to Global Fishing Watch.

Aberdeen had a dry run last year when facing Chikhura Sachkhere in Georgia.As Chikhura’s stadium did not meet Uefa regulations, the Europa League qualier was switched to the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena in Tbilisi.With only a few hundred fans in attendance at the , capacity stadium, it was an eerie atmosphere and one of the most bizarre games I have ever attended. Aberdeen were able to overcome that and draw -.Saturday offers not just a chance for Scottish football to shine, but also for Aberdeen to lay down an early marker of intent for the season.Hopefully midfielder Craig Bryson can remain injury-free in the upcoming season after a frustrating debut campaign.Bryson  joined the Dons last summer with an ankle injury that saw him miss the end of the - season with Derby. He passed a stringent medical before joining the Reds.After recovering from that ankle problem, he injured the other.Bryson scored in the - friendly draw with Hibs and is ready for the new season.Cove Rangers can now fully concentrate on preparing for le in League  as the fear of being denied promotion is over.Despite romping to the League  title, Cove have been unable to fully enjoy their much deserved success – until now.A three-man arbitration  this week reached a unanimous decision to confirm the relegations of Hearts, Partick Thistle and Stranraer.Had the  decided the other way, Cove, Dundee United and Raith could have had their promotions wiped out.The case was heard in Edinburgh’s Court of Session before being referred to the Scottish FA for the arbitration process.Following a rigorous examination with many witnesses and full access to relevant documents, records, emails and telephone logs, a decision was made on Monday to uphold the relegations.Now all concerned parties must stick by it and move on.Over the last few months there has been enough ision, argument and chaos in Scottish football to last a letime.It would have been shockingCove were denied their rightful place in League One due to a situation completely outwith their control.However, I have sympathy for Hearts, Partick and Stranraer and still think a temporary two-season set-up of --- could have worked.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

The masts provide a link between smart meters installed in homes and the energy companies in a bid to improve energy use efficiency.An Arqiva spokesperson said: #The wireless network for smart metering uses existing infrastructure where possible, but some new masts need to be built to ensure virtually all energy consumers and businesses in Scotland will reap the benefits.#Whenever new masts are needed, we adhere to the full planning process.#Planning is controlled by the local authority and an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #The contractor Arqiva, as an electronic communications code operator, will use permitted development rights set out under Class  of Part  of Schedule  of the Town and Country Planning Order , as amended.#In some cases, as at Minard, the installation of apparatus will not trigger a specic requirement for planning permission.#There are no buildings within  metres of the development so, as per national guidelines, there is no requirement for neighbour notication.#The community council was informed of the proposed development in December  and, after discussion and a site meeting, members agreed that as this was a government initiative and the structure was of a small scale it had no objections to the application.West Loch Fyne Community Council convener Fred Bruce explained: #No comments were received by the community council from any Minard residents. It was our understanding all parties near the proposed site would receive statutory notication from the local authority. As no comments were made to the community council we made no adverse comment to planning re same.#He added: #Having visited the site we do not see there is any serious visual impact on the area. Some residents in Minard have driven through and were unaware it was there.#Mid Argyll councillors Sandy Taylor and Dougie Philand have, however, called for communication to be improved between developers and residents.Councillor Taylor told the Advertiser: #I am pleased to support the community as they assert their right to meaningful engagement by prospective developers and the relocation of the mast and have written to the company expressing my concerns for direct engagement with residents affected by developments of this type.##I was not made aware of the proposal until I was contacted by dissatisfied residents when the decision had been taken,# added Councillor Philand.#I believe the siting of the mast was insensitive and not to consult withaffected residents was wrong.#It seems typical of large companies, doing what they want irrespective of what local opinion is.#"},{"url":null,"title":"shop to ship plan to help island businesses stay afloat","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsA #shop to ship# initiative has been launched to help shore-based businesses get goods to tourists onboard visiting vessels.Following the pandemic, the idea aims to help small businesses in remote areas and islands to carry on trading with visitors arriving by sea, while also respecting the concerns of communities about those stepping ashore.It aims to promote the advanced order and purchase of local seafood, fresh food, arts and crafts, with arrangements made between the business and visitor for the safe drop off and collection from quays, ports and harbours.The idea is sailors visiting the area use a dedicated website in advance to find out about shore-based food and craft producers then make arrangements.It is hoped the move will help in the economic recovery of remote rural and island destinations which have been hard hit by the lockdown and rely on visitors.Sail Scotland, a membership group for the marine tourism industry, is behind the idea.Its web-based portal will allow businesses to promote beer, wines and spirits, local seafood, fresh foods, meats, bakery, dairy, takeaways, groceries, household items and arts and crafts to customers arriving by sea.Alan Rankin, chief executive of Sail Scotland, said: #A key element of the Scottish sailing experience is the world-class food and drink available through shore-side businesses.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit. The people of Prestonpans certainly came out to show their support and for that we are truly grateful.ldquoWe would like to take this opportunity to thank the future Queen Lily [Bennion] and her royal court, as well as their families for their patience and understanding.

It was great to see so many of you as we travelled around as many streets as we could while visiting the members of the royal court.ldquoTo the royal court children, we didnrsquot want to forget that it would have been your day, we can still have your special day next year.ldquoTo Queen Lily, you were absolutely stunning, even reducing some of the committee to tears your mum and dad will be proud of you, the way you conducted yourself on what should have been your special day. To you, the community of Prestonpans for coming out and showing your appreciation as we passed by quietlyin our cars, doing the alternative gala parade.

parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and they have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put

There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow. Im considering putting up bat boxes after reading that a lone bat can eat , midges in one night.Citronella and Saltidinare among the ingredients that midges are said to find repugnant and give a wide berth.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"books-peter-geoghegan-dark-money-reshaped-political-agenda","story":"Peter GeogheganHead of Zeus, pound.Review by Fiona RintoulON reaching chapter four of Peter Geogheganrsquos meticulously researched and highly readable new book Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics, I emitted a small scream of ldquoNo!. Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty. During the  general election campaign, the Conservative Party rebranded its Twitter account as FactcheckUK with no consequences. However, all the blame for the increasing role of unregulated digital campaigning in our politics cannot be laid at the door of right-wing parties. Barack Obama was one of the first to harness its power.Written in crisp, vivid prose, Democracy for Sale is a dense but compelling narrative that takes us from the backstreets of Washington DC to Viktor Orbagravenrsquos Hungary. Above all, it is a call to arms, and everyone who is concerned about our democracy should read it.While Geoghegan remains an optimist, he does not hide the scale or urgency of the challenge. ldquoLike the climate, democracy is fast reaching a tipping point, he warns."},{"url":null,"title":"food-chef-tom-kerridge-shares-passion-bbqs","story":"Barbecues at the ready because chef Tom Kerridge, holder of two Michelin stars, has a trove of summertime cooking treats to share.During the course of his new show, Tom Kerridge Barbecues - on the Food Network, the chef will be showing off some old and new recipes using charcoal, smoke and fire.He talks about his favourite dish from the series and why everyone - including professional chefs - are prone to barbecue disasters from time to time.How did this series come about \"I filmed with Food Network last year, a big series for the States, they gave me a call and said listen do you want to do something with barbecues... it was actually a really good, fun thing to do.

He saw it dferently, calling her interventions ldquointolerable.The Thatcher-Major tussle was something of an exception, with most past leaders taking care not to criticise from the sidelines. Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid. Mr Major himself threatened to take Boris Johnson to court for proroguing parliament.Tony Blair has fast become the past premier most likely to pop up with ldquohelpful advice, as he showed on Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday.With the BBC Sunday programmes now on their summer hols, presenter Sophy Ridge made the most of being the only show in town, breezing straight in on the dayrsquos big story ndash the sudden imposition of a fortnightrsquos quarantine for holidaymakers ing from Spain. Among those caught out by the rule change was Englandrsquos Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps.Jon Ashworth, Shadow Health Secretary, called the Governmentrsquos performance ldquoshambolic.\"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenere who are confused, and they dont know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks quarantine. The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Its latest position paper, Learning to Live Alongside Covid-, was ostensibly the reason for his latest appearance.It was a wide-ranging interview covering everything from Russia and China to Scottish independence. You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics. Isnrsquot it time to take a break, she wondered, go round the golf course or to the shepherdrsquos hut  David Cameron famously opted for the latter, spending a cool pound, on one for his Cotswolds garden.Mr Blair seemed momentarily taken aback. ldquoItrsquos not something I want to do. A lot of people might think thatrsquos exactly what he should do, stop talking about things. But I care about the country, I think we are at a huge moment of change in the world.Addressing the elephant backseat passenger in the room, he went on: ldquoIrsquove tried to do something that previous prime ministers have not done, but in the future I predict that many more will try and do because you leave office when yoursquove still got a lot of years of active working le.ldquoI always say to peopleyou donrsquot want to listen to me itrsquos a free world, donrsquot bother.\"But Irsquom not going to be playing rounds of golf or sitting twiddling my thumbs.

With more than one million Scots having been furloughed and think tanks making dire economic forecasts for the retail, hospitality, and tourism sector, the reality is more likely to be a tsunami of redundancies once the UK Government pulls the plug on its financial support schemes. The bounce back, as they say in stock markets, may be more like a dead cat bouncing.It would, therefore, be premature for the Scottish Government to even begin thinking about repealing the emergency measures introduced at the beginning of this crisis to help Scots struggling financially with this crisis.This includes the measures that were taken to extend protection for people from Sherf Officers from  days to six months, when they used Scotlandrsquos statutory moratorium procedure for debt. It also includes the decision to require landlords to give six monthsrsquo notice before initiating court action for rent arrears and includes the steps to waive bankruptcy application fees for those in most need.However, unless the Scottish Government acts, all these measures will be repealed on the th September , when the sunset clause for the CoronavirusActs No  and No  come into effect.To allow this to occur now would be financially calamitous for many. As we have seen from previous economic downturns, financial fallout is often a lagging effect of an economic crises and often comes later: not when the events leading to it occur. This will particularly be the case with this one.The last thing the Scottish Government should be doing now is pulling away the safety net from those people it was intended to help.In fact, there is a stronger case to be made that this is the time to strengthen that net and even extend its reach to provide greater protection for those most vulnerable.Already the UKrsquos large debt and homelessness charities, such as Shelter and Citizen Advice are lobbying the UK Government to take further steps to protect tenants and the UK Government has now laid regulations for their own debt Breathing Space Schemes in England and Wales, which will commence next year. Both of which are far more reaching than anything we have in Scotland.They not only protect people from bailfs but freeze interest and charges on debts and prevent evictions and repossessions. They also include specic measures to help those struggling with a mental health crisisthey are receiving help from mental health professionals. In Scotland we have no such comparative measures.It may well be, that even in those areas where the Scottish Parliament has the power to make a dference, the UK Government may now go further in introducing protections for the most vulnerable.We can only hope that the Scottish Government now focus on the financial fallout from this crisis and use the full powers of the Parliament to not repeal the measures they introduced, but extend them to March , and introduce more permanent measures in their place.If it does not, it is not legal powers they lack, but political will.Alan McIntosh is a money adviser.

Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty. During the  general election campaign, the Conservative Party rebranded its Twitter account as FactcheckUK with no consequences. However, all the blame for the increasing role of unregulated digital campaigning in our politics cannot be laid at the door of right-wing parties. Barack Obama was one of the first to harness its power.Written in crisp, vivid prose, Democracy for Sale is a dense but compelling narrative that takes us from the backstreets of Washington DC to Viktor Orbagravenrsquos Hungary. Above all, it is a call to arms, and everyone who is concerned about our democracy should read it.While Geoghegan remains an optimist, he does not hide the scale or urgency of the challenge. ldquoLike the climate, democracy is fast reaching a tipping point, he warns."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  We can all help regenerate Scotland  39 s wild lands","story":"The guilt many of us feel for the part wersquove played in environmental calamity can be paralysing.

The Law Society, through the national working group, are involved in the current arrangements for a pilot to be conducted in Glasgow Sherf Court.ldquoThis pilot will refine the standards required for virtual custody hearings, and takes account of the matters raised in the Law Society report.

Irsquove on occasion actually refused to engage in questions that I judged would have taken us into political territory.Referring to Ms Forbesrsquos point about borrowing powers, she said: ldquoSometimes one personrsquos political issue is another personrsquos very legitimate issue part and parcel of dealing with Covid, and the fiscal flexibility of the government to deal with the overall consequences of Covid I would put into the latter category.ldquoI accept that others with a dferent view of that will see that as political.ldquoBut the idea that our ability to deal financially with the economic impact of Covid is not a part of the handling of this doesnrsquot bear much scrutiny.She went on: ldquoI think these briefings are important. We are not out of this pandemic yet. This pandemic, to use the language of the World Health Organisation, is still accelerating globally.ldquoWersquore in a very good position, relatively speaking, in Scotland right now, but we cannot take it for granted.ldquoMy biggest concern right now is that there things all of us can do to keep this under control that wersquore all maybe getting a bit lax at doing.ldquoIrsquom trying to strike a balance here - I donrsquot want to talk about politics here, Irsquove refused to do that on more occasions that I can remember right now - but Irsquom also trying to strike a balance between not doing that but doing the courtesy that I owe to journalists of answering the questions you pose to me.\"I might not get that right at every occasion. Irsquom not perfect.ldquoBut I will say to the opposition - in the middle of a pandemic, at a really crucial stage of this, when the dferent between continuing to go in the good direction wersquore going in or going backward is so finely balanced - criticise me, find other ways to criticise me.ldquoThat is fine.

Along with councillor Woodbridge, councillor Graham Sinclair and councillor Stephen Clackson were elected at the last council election.Councillor Sinclair said: “Being a north isles councillor is a challenging yet rewarding and very ied post to hold.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

Throughout the crisis we have continued to draw down mortgages and are currently lending up to % loan to value.As a responsible lender we consider a range of factors to assess the affordability of the mortgage in the long-term. At this time we are not accepting mortgage applications from customers who are on furlough but we will keep this under review.Nationwide Building Society said it will consider applications from people who have been furloughed but added those on furlough are not eligible for the society#s recently launched % loan to value first-time buyer mortgages.Bank of Ireland said: We are lending to customers who are furloughed. We#ll ask customers to provide some information about the terms of the furlough during the application process.Lender AIB said: All our lending is based on the customer#s ability to repay. This is to protect the customer from undue risk. Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis.Ulster Bank said it was “strongly committed to lending to all kinds of mortgage borrowers - this includes those on furlough and those ing from furlough”.“As always, they base lending decisions on affordability and ability to repay and they take each case on an inidual basis.”A spokeswoman for Progressive Building Society said it is “a responsible lender and reviews and assesses every case on an inidual basis including the income and expenditure of all applicants”.HSBC said it will not lend to furloughed workers whoseto work date is further than three months away or there is nodate at all.Mortgage broker and advisor London  Country said: “Mortgage lenders have sought to support those on furlough through the lockdown period and in the main have continued to accept furloughed income when considering how much they can offer to borrowers. “That would of course often mean a reduced income and consequent reduction in the size of borrowing available but at least most lenders would be able to consider lending.  “As we move closer to the unwinding of the jobs retention scheme borrowers should expect to see more questions aboutto work and some lenders are now stipulating that they will want some confirmation. “Getting employer confirmation may not be possible for all at this stage but on the upside those that can, may be able to use theirto work income for the affordability assessment.  “That approach will be consistent whether for first time buyers or next time buyers as lenders will need to be able to demonstrate that the mortgage is affordable and will remain sustainable. “However the market is still light on deals for those with small deposits which is often a bigger issue for first time buyers and some of the lenders that have ed to the % LTV market will potentially set a higher expectation when it comes to credit score.”Belfast Most ReadBelfast nightclub owner left with £ in bank account pleads for Stormont#s helpRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeThree dead from same family: Kilrea husband, we and brother victims of horric crashDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media posts,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The teenager#s body was discovered on August  beside a small stream about .km from the resort.Although her family believe there was a criminal element to what happened, police have said there was no sign the -year-old was abducted or raped.A preliminary post-mortem examination showed she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.An inquest into her death is due to begin on August  and last until September .Denis Barror, the Dublin-based solicitor acting for Meabh and her French father Sebastien, declined to comment on the proceedings.Ms Brennan denied defaming the couple and said she was surprised that they were taking a case. I will be defending myself. I don#t believe they have a cause of action against me, she said.Ms Brennan said that while she wrote very extreme things on the social media , she believed them to be true. Facebook declined to comment.Ms Brennan is a former partner in a Dublin law firm, and specialised in employment and equality law. She retired in  due to an illness.She confirmed her Facebook account was suspended for  days last September but was reinstated and remains active.The case is the second set of proceedings initiated by the Quoirin family since the tragedy occurred. They are also suing the owner of the resort for alleged negligence.Confirming details of that case last January, Sankara Nair, a lawyer for Nora#s parents, said the family strongly believed she was abducted as she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.The lawsuit alleges a cottage window was found ajar, with its latch broken, on the morning she disappeared.It is also claimed the resort gate was left open without any security and there was no surveillance camera except for the reception area.According to the claim, Nora had poor motor skills and needed help to walk. Although in her mid-teens, her mental age was about five or six years.Mr Sankara said the resort was not safe for Nora and that anybody could have come in and taken her. In an interview with RTE News last December, Meabh and Sebastian Quoirin said they were determined to get truth and justice.I think we will seek justice in so far as we can. We have to find peace in our own hearts, said Meabh Quoirin.We will carry Nora with us forever. She#s with us here every day. I talk to her every day. She holds my hand. We hear her.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry Central Library in Foyle Street is one of just five libraries from across the North which were chosen to be part of a pilot scheme to allow customers back in. Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March . We opened on Thursday and there were people queuing to get in which was great to see, she said. Weve had lots of families coming in and they have told us that they really missed it, especially the Rhythm and Rhyme sessions. googletag.cmd.push  Maisie and Daithi Flood enjoy getting back to the library.

Unfortunately, we have had to take out a lot of seating to allow for social distancing, but this is something we will continue to look at.

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig. Staff will also be carrying out a high level of cleaning in the library. Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people.

A customer can view our online catalogue and checka particular book they are interested in is available in their local library, they will then phone and speak with a member of staff who will set it aside and arrange a day and time for them to come in and collect it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.

LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner. “There are a lot of positive health implications of being outside and on the water.”  LOCH LOMOND: Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened self-catering properties and cruises For more information on staying safe, please go to www.discovernorthernireland. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCOvM_IeoCFQzwQodkcEARw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\" --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11636074.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I fully understand, and support the need for language ersity.”Complaints have been made about the post to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by Conradh na Gaeilge, an advocacy group for Irish language speakers, and a -year-old boy.Conradh na Gaeilge alleged the post is a breach of the House of Commons code of conduct, saying it was “offensive and insulting in nature to those who speak the Irish language”.In a complaint letter shared on Twitter, Adam Mac Giolla Easbuic, who attends an Irish Medium School in Dungiven – within Mr Campbell’s constituency – requested the commissioner investigates “racist undertones to both Germans and Irish speakers”.He wrote: “I find Mr Campbell’s comments extremely offensive and disrespectful.“It is clear that he learned nothing during the Acht na Gaeilge campaign for an Irish Language Act that me and all my friends took part in.“I don’t think his comments are suitable for an MP to make.“Thank you for taking the time to read my complaint. I hope that you will investigate this.”Disagreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein over an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland was a sticking point in political talks between the parties last year, ahead of the New Decade New Approach deal.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Which is to make sure that Anne Sacoolas goes through the UK justice system. That has to happen.ldquoYou and I would have had to have done it ndash in my view she is no dferent.ldquoSo we will keep fighting ndash today is going to be extremely tough, but the determination never wavers, ever.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matter what today takes out of us, tomorrow will be yet another day of fighting.
