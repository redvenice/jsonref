The company was founded by track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman and a middle-distance runner Phil Knight, from Portland.Business Insider reported that while Knight had planned to call the company Dimension 6, the name Nike was thought of by their first employee Jeff Johnson and comes from the Greek goddess of victory\u0027s name. 1971 was also the year that Bowerman had his first eureka moment while he was making waffles with his wife. Seeing the waffle iron sparked an idea for grooved patterns on the sole of trainers to help athletes grip the tracks while running and it was referred to as the Nike Waffle Trainer, patented in 1974.In addition to this, the iconic Nike swoosh logo was designed by Portland State student Carolyn Davidson for just $35, more than $200 in today’s currency, but she was later given stock that is now worth over $640,000.The Just Do It slogan was inspired by serial killer Gary Gilmore who had said ‘let’s do it’ before he was executed in 1977 by a firing squad. 11 years later, the first Just Do It campaign was launched, featuring Walt Stack, an 80-year-old runner.Nike was also the first company to use a Beatles song  in a TV commercial, their track Revolution featuring in the sporting giant’s 1987 ad for the Air Max shoes.            Colin Kaepernick kneels during the national anthem before an NFL game against the SeahawksNike adAs reported by Time, many have wondered how much Kaepernick’s deal with Nike could be worth, with some sports agents claiming it could be  millions of dollars a year, which would be a unique development considering he does not currently play for a team in the NFL.The Nike ad features the former player with a caption reading: ‘Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt.’ Despite having signed Colin in 2011, Nike had not used him in over two years and the company agreed to an eight-year extension of the deal with the league in March.Gino Fisanotti, Nike’s Vice President of Brand for North America said: \u0027We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation. We wanted to energize its meaning and introduce Just Do It to a new generation of athletes,’ adding  the campaign was aimed at those who were between 15 and 17.The full advert, which features Kaepernick for 20 seconds, concludes with the quarterback saying: \u0027So don\u0027t just ask if your dreams are crazy, ask if they\u0027re crazy enough.\u0027 The caption at the end flashes: \u0027It\u0027s only crazy until you do it. Just do it.\u0027Nike boycottAfter the Nike advert was released, protesters on social media called for people to burn their Nike sneakers and boycott the retailer after choosing Kaepernick for its signature Just Do It campaign, with shares in the company initially plummeting.In addition to a number of social media users, actor James Woods joined the many who criticised Nike on Twitter, tweeting that he emailed his wealth manager asking him to sell all of his  shares.\u0027Please est my portfolio of all Nike stock in my personal account in and the plan. Henceforth never buy Nike stock for me again.\u0027 He followed up by tweeting out a meme mocking the Nike slogan, saying, \u0027Nike: Just Sold It.\u0027Nike stockDespite Nike stock having an uptick now, after the company released their 30th anniversary Just Do It campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, shares fell by two percent to $79.01 but have since recovered to $81.13 per share as of approximately 11:26am EST on Friday, September 7.According to CNBC calculations, if one invested $1,000 in 2008, it would now be worth $6,131.47.While it is not clear whether Kaepernick’s inclusion in the advert would affect Nike’s stock in the long term, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, said: ‘While Nike has been doing relatively well in a sports market that is under pressure, it cannot afford to make bad decisions.‘Anything which has the potential to damage market share, such as overtly political campaigns, should be avoided.’ However, Host of Mad Money Jim Cramer, pointed out that ‘if people think Colin Kaepernick is cool,’ then ‘it’s a win for Nike.’It is estimated that Nike generated $43 million in free advertising through media coverage when the campaign collaboration with Kaepernick was first revealed at the start of the week, despite the backlash.Nike worthAccording to Statista, Nike’s global net income in 2018 amounted to $1.9 billion, which is a significant drop from $4.2 billion last year and what seemed to be a steady growth from 2009 onwards.Forbes reported that Nike was the world\u0027s leading athletic apparel maker and has a brand value of $15.9 billion. In addition to this, it increased its revenue to $24 billion from $16 billion in five years.Nike\u0027s share of the footwear market rose from 14 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period and expanded its presence in international football, as well as professional and college sports.  Prince Harry has worn the same bracelet for 20 years and this is whyFortnite Monopoly: When is it released and how is it different from the traditional board game?Who is Joe Rogan?

Britannia would be a place for fun, for mischief and — in a world governed by ritual and tradition — for the spur-of-the-moment.Diplomat Sir Roger du Boulay and his wife joined the Yacht for a week in 1974 during his years as Resident Commissioner of the New Hebrides. They were astounded one night when dinner was followed by the ship’s entertainment — ‘an elaborate pantomime’ — in front of the Royal Family and the crew, with the Queen acting as wardrobe assistant.‘It involved the equerry taking the part of a Polynesian beauty,’ says du Boulay. ‘I remember him sitting on the floor and I remember seeing the Queen kneeling on the floor. He was stripped to the waist and she was fitting a brassiere on to him. It was an extraordinary sight!’ABOARD, informality would go a long way — but it had its limits. John Gorton, former Prime Minister of Australia, later recalled one beach barbecue with the family during a 1970 tour of Australia, when the royal party decided it was time for a swim.‘Princess Anne was thrown in and then Prince Philip,’ he said. ‘I was sitting next to Her Majesty and I was just about to throw her in but I looked at her and something about the way she looked at me told me that perhaps I shouldn’t. In the end, the Queen was the only one who stayed dry.’May briefs Queen on Brexit progress at Balmoral amid claims...From Windsor and Windermere to Loch Ness and \u0027Game of...Share this article    HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh on board HMY Britannia in March 1972But ultimately Britannia’s demise was down to bad timing and political incompetence.In the mid-Nineties a substantial refit was required. Shortly before the 1997 election, the Conservative government announced that it would build a new yacht with a budget of £60 million.But it had failed to follow a political golden rule, that major undertakings involving the Crown require cross-party agreement.Tony Blair’s New Labour was not consulted and duly opposed the idea, which thus became an election issue. Not surprisingly, on being elected a few months later, the Labour government declined to commission a new yacht.Blair would later admit to me that it had been a mistake to get rid of Britannia in the first place and that he would have retained it, if he had been elected sooner.The Royal Family determinedly avoided becoming involved in what was clearly a political matter and thus strictly off-limits. Hence the brevity of the mournful speech by the Prince of Wales to the ship’s company on the night of Britannia’s retirement, the shortest after-dinner address of his life.‘I just want to get blindly, madly drunk,’ he declared and sat down again, to thunderous applause. His audience knew exactly how he felt.Adapted from Queen Of The World by Robert Hardman, (Century, £25). © Robert Hardman 2018.To order a copy for £20 (offer valid to September 20, 2018 p\u0026ampp free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/09/09/4FED958D00000578-0-image-a-16_1536482835591.jpg","title":"Two three middle aged women addicted phones","story":"Middle-aged women may find it just as hard to put away their phones – and social media can have toxic effects on their self-esteem too, a poll has foundAround half of those in their 30s and 40s say they would not be able to delete their social media accounts – despite admitting feeling jealous of friends or bad about themselves because of what they see on social media.

This is to avoid the risk of a child migrant accidentally being placed in adult accommodation or detention.But on some occasions it meant adults were treated as children – potentially posing a risk to school pupils, foster families or children in care.          Migrants trying to get into lorries at Calais in desperate attempt to seek asylum elsewhereEarlier this year a report by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, David Bolt, said that Home Office staff ‘did not feel confident about making initial age assessments of applicants posing as children – particularly judging whether the claimant was “significantly over 18” and should be entered into the adult process.’Mr Bolt added: ‘They received no training to help them make such judgments. Some local authorities were concerned that the Home Office applied its benefit of the doubt policy too readily.’Among those concerned was Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a member of the Commons home affairs select Committee, who said: ‘This has been a problem for some time. We have been a soft touch in too many cases for asylum seekers who abuse our hospitality by elaborating their credentials.‘It is right we give a safe haven to those who are in danger, but too often we have been too trusting.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/14/4FE0B5F300000578-0-image-m-23_1536411680346.jpg","title":"Sydney amateur naturalist stumbles rare hairs envelope belonging extinct Tasmanian tiger","story":"    A small package (pictured) bought at auction by an amateur Sydney naturalist has been confirmed to contain rare hairs belonging to the extinct Tasmanian tiger.He created a crowdfunding campaign to raise the money needed to buy a microscope, but was then given a helping hand by CSIRO - the government agency responsible for scientific research.Colin Veitch, who works in the CSIRO microscopy laboratory at Geelong, said he read about the hairs in an online article.He said: \u0027I saw it online and thought I should help.\u0027Heartbreaking photos show the dire plight of koalas in the...Grin and bear it: First sun bear cub ever to be born in the...Share this article    Put under the microscope at a perspective of one-tenth of a millimeter, scientists were able to confirm the hair was indeed from a Tasmanian tiger          Mr Rehrberg bought the small envelope labelled \u0027thylacinus cynocephalus\u0027 (pictured) with the aim of investigating the true extinction date of the carnivorous marsupial.\u0027We\u0027ve got microscopes that can zoom in 2-5,000 times, so I offered our services to help him a look at the fibres.\u0027A photo taken by the microscope, which shows one the hairs up close, was enough for the CSIRO team to know that the hair was indeed from a Tasmanian tiger.The researchers said each of the three hairs were different and likely represented a different part of the tiger\u0027s skin and fur.They added it was likely the thylacine\u0027s additional level of hair meant the species had evolved to suit cooler, damper climates.Mr Veitch said: \u0027Those fibres would have been taken some time in the 1800s and some naturalist had taken them back to the UK.\u0027 The microscopy team at CSIRO joked they were now on the lookout for Tibetan Yeti hair so they could prove the existence of the abominable snowman,     CSIRO scientist Veitch said: \u0027Those fibres would have been taken some time in the 1800s and some naturalist had taken them back to the UK.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/10/06/4FF542BA00000578-6150017-Anna_Wintour_checking_out_Sunday_s_game_at_the_Arthur_Ashe_Stadi-a-134_1536557436606.jpg","title":"Meryl Streep Anna Wintour celebs watch Novak Djokovic wins 14th Grand Slam","story":"    Anna Wintour checking out Sunday\u0027s game at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens, New York          Model Christie Brinkley was also at the game with her son Jack and his girlfriend Nina Agdal          At one point during the match, Brinkley\u0027s son Jack shared a kiss with Agdal          Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend were among the celebs at the match.

The helicopter is based at a former RAF base in Lincolnshire which the farmer bought for £250,000 in 2014 and runs as a wider holiday park for military enthusiasts  Mr Roughton was also helped by friend Josh French, left, in removing some of the components and wiring from the vehicle to enable it to be turned into a proper room, right          The vehicle, pictured, does not have access to a toilet though so only customers who book accommodation at the site itself are able to use it      The Lynx, pictured, was used by the Royal Navy and Army from the late 1970s until 2018, serving in the Falklands, Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan warsThe Army and Navy would continue to fly the Lynx on missions in conflicts for the next two decades, with the vehicle having a prominent role in conflicts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq before being retired in 2018.A Lynx was also brought down in County Armagh in Northern Ireland in 1994 while attempting to land at a base, in what was described as the IRA\u0027s most successful attack on a helicopter, even though the pilot survived. They were crewed by a maximum of three people and could carry eight troops while being powered by two Rolls Royce turboshaft 1,120hp engines.The Lynx is also responsible for the fastest helicopter speed ever recorded after a specially modified model reached 249mph in 1986. They typically carried two torpedoes, two depth charges or two Sea Skua missiles, alongside two 20mm cannons, two 70mm rocket pods and eight anti-tank missiles.                          Mr Roughton from Skegness, said: \u0027I live by the Only Fools and Horses character Del Boy\u0027s motto of \u0027he who dares wins\u0027, so finding myself in this new line of work was blind faith.\u0027The helicopter was extremely difficult as it was made of aluminium, rounded walls, and old cables and had pipes everywhere.\u0027It was definitely a new challenge learning how to do it all, but we\u0027re really thrilled - if not surprised - that we\u0027ve managed to turn a helicopter into what it is today.\u0027Mr Roughton, 40, has been farming half his life but says he got the \u0027offer of a lifetime\u0027 when the Ministry of Defence proposed he save the RAF Wainfleet bombing range which was surrounded by his land.The broccoli and kale farmer snapped up the half-acre site in 2014 for £250,000 and decided to provide quirky accommodation befitting the location\u0027s military background.

This is to avoid the risk of a child migrant accidentally being placed in adult accommodation or detention.But on some occasions it meant adults were treated as children – potentially posing a risk to school pupils, foster families or children in care.          Migrants trying to get into lorries at Calais in desperate attempt to seek asylum elsewhereEarlier this year a report by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, David Bolt, said that Home Office staff ‘did not feel confident about making initial age assessments of applicants posing as children – particularly judging whether the claimant was “significantly over 18” and should be entered into the adult process.’Mr Bolt added: ‘They received no training to help them make such judgments. Some local authorities were concerned that the Home Office applied its benefit of the doubt policy too readily.’Among those concerned was Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a member of the Commons home affairs select Committee, who said: ‘This has been a problem for some time.

As the cult work returns to London, the place of its birth, he relives three years of toilThe idea is brilliantly simple and completely audacious. Entitled The Clock and lasting 24 hours, the world’s most popular piece of concept art is a gigantic collage of film clips – old and new, black-and-white and colour – showing thousands of glimpses of clocks, watches, sundials and snatches of people telling each other the time, all set up to correspond to real time wherever it is shown, right round the clock.It is a staggering, almost superhuman feat of research that has gained a cult following ever since it was unveiled at the White Cube gallery in London in 2010. The Clock’s easy-to-grasp governing principle coexists with the almost ungraspable fact that its creator, Christian Marclay, really has pulled it off, beguilingly combining the utter randomness of each inidual clip with the strict form of his overarching idea, allowing everyone to meditate on time, how we’re obsessed with it, how there’s never enough of it.Clips include the obvious bit from Fred Zinneman’s High Noon, the midnight scene from Orson Welles’s The Stranger, and Christopher Walken’s wristwatch in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction. The work won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2011, was sold to six major art institutions around the world, and is now always playing somewhere, though the American artist’s instructions are that it can’t be displayed in more than one location simultaneously. And now it is coming home, returning to the city of its birth as it ticks into life next week at Tate Modern. Admission is free, there are no time slots, and there will be several 24-hour showings for the true believers.I first saw The Clock in 2011 and my mind was entirely blown. It’s a mesmerising, dreamlike kaleidoscope that is also hilarious. Ever since, I have been unable to see a shot of a clock or a watch in a film without thinking of it. “Yes! Me too!” grins Marclay as we meet at Tate Modern. “I’m always seeing clocks in films and thinking, ‘Damn, now that would have been great for The Clock!’”Marclay is a calm, reserved person, looking rather like the architect he once pondered being. He is in Britain not just because of The Clock: he is composer-in-residence for the Huddersfield contemporary music festival, where he is premiering Investigations, an improvisory piece for 20 pianos. Its players will work from a “graphic score” – not sheet music, but images of hands in various positions on the keyboard“I don’t write notes,” says the 63-year-old artist. “I can’t read or write music in the traditional way. This is a photography-based score. The musicians have to decipher images. I get them involved in the process. I’m not one of those fascist composers who says, ‘Play this!’”So when did Marclay first get the idea for The Clock? Well, in 1995 he created a droll seven-minute work entitled Telephones, a pre-YouTube supercut of people in films making phonecalls. But The Clock’s real genesis lay in a project not so different from his Huddersfield composition. “I was working in New York on a ‘video score’ – a video projection that triggers music from live musicians. I wanted to mark time and one way to do that was to use clocks. That’s when I had this eureka moment. What if, in the history of film, I could find every minute of 24 hours? But it would take for ever – it’s an impossible task!”So it seemed – until he came to London in 2007, his wife Lydia Yee having been appointed curator at the Barbican. Marclay took his idea to the White Cube gallery – and they got behind it. “Almost every film has such a moment,” he says. “It might just be someone in a restaurant checking their watch. The idea of documenting the banal is very important to me. What creates anxiety is people just waiting and being nervous.”So the process began. “I recruited researchers with an ad in a video shop in Clerkenwell that has long gone. It specialised in hard-to-find films and experimental things. First, I asked for films with obvious time themes: thrillers, doomsday dramas, James Bond films where the hero always has a luxury watch. We looked at lot of British films: every time something happens in London, you can bet you’re going to see Big Ben. But then I said, ‘Bring me everything!’”Over the course of the next three years, a team of assistants watched hundreds and hundreds of films, grinding through videocassettes. “My assistants had an account at the store, renting all these VHS films. We instructed them on how to ‘rip’ the part. Some assistants didn’t last very long, because they just didn’t get it. There was one guy who just kept on bringing me clips of horror movies, people getting decapitated. He had me really worried.”How about the wee small hours stretch that runs from midnight to daybreak? It’s the most mysterious and almost hidden part of The Clock, the section most people won’t get to see. “Everything up to midnight was pretty easy,” says Marclay. “And of course midnight is a highlight. Then there are people going out, it’s two or three in the morning – and people commit crimes at that time. But four or five is very hard. At five, the baker gets up, the street cleaner gets up. But between, in that weird hour – you’re not going to rob a bank at 4am. But just before we wake up is the time when we dream a lot. There’s a lot of dreams in cinema.”Is Marclay a cinephile? No. I like movies and I go once in a while. But I see movies mostly on airplanes. I don’t have a TV and I don’t watch films at home. It’s the same with my work on music. I love music, but I’m not obsessed with it. I don’t have to have music on all the time. My record collection is in storage in New York. If you\u0027re too respectful and adoring a fan of cinema, you don’t want to touch it.The collage nature of The Clock stems from Marclay’s early work in music, long before hip-hop, when he would experiment with turntables and get weird sounds from vinyl discs. He was fascinated by the “texture” of recorded music, the scratches, crackles and hisses. In New York in the 70s, he played in an art-rock band, and would take a record player with him on stage. The group were called the Bachelors, Even – after Marcel Duchamp’s artwork The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even.Marclay was born in the US to an American mother and a Swiss-French father. The family moved to Geneva, and Marclay grew up speaking French and English, attending art school in the Swiss capital before returning to America. “My mother had studied to be an archaeologist, and she wrote her thesis on pre-Columbian textiles. She was the more artistic spirit and she encouraged me in the arts.”And how about his father, was he an artist? Marclay laughs. “No! No! Not at all. He was a dental technician. He had a lab where he made false teeth. He always said he was more of a jeweller because he made miniature sculptures.” Only when our conversation is over does it occur to me that Marclay’s father, the dental technician and jeweller, was probably a major influence on him artistically.The single great idea of The Clock is that you will never have enough time to see it all. That, says Marclay, makes its message one of acceptance. “Some people are frustrated and they feel they have to see all 24 hours. I say, ‘No no no!’ Just enjoy it for the moment. Enjoy what you can. When it’s time to eat or go to the bathroom, you leave.”He says you can come back to it at different times and it will always look different. “It’s a bit like a landscape. I was recently in the mountains, the Swiss Alps. There wasn’t a time when I saw the same thing twice. Different light, different colours. It’s mind-boggling.”• The Clock is at Tate Modern, London, 14 September to 20 January.

I chose 10 of them and then set out to find their human counterpart.Fenella and Georgine, a saluki“The plan was to shoot the dogs, find the humans, style them, then have them behave or pose in a similar way. This process would be repeated until we had all the shots. At the same time I would always have one eye on people I passed in the street. Many of the subjects I stopped in the park or on the bus, and had to find a tactful way of saying you look exactly like a poodle, can I take your photograph?Henry and Hope, an Afghan hound“Without exception, people reacted positively. I always led my request with a compliment, particularly if it was to a total stranger … ‘I’m working on a photographic project and you have beautiful hair interesting teetha magnificent nose!’ I’ve been taking photographs for a long time so am well versed in administering dubious compliments.Amelia and Artemis, a standard poodle“Almost all the dogs were funny. The giant Newfoundland had way too much love to give and almost killed my assistant, knocking her to the ground and cuddling her into submission. Our beautiful, competition winning, standard poodle was in hair and make-up for about two hours, and then the next dog turned up early. They took one look at each other and set off together, rolling and barking and generally going bonkers. The groomer was distraught. One dog mistook my tripod for a lamppost and every other dog who followed saw this as an invitation that would be rude to ignore.Sophie and Percy, a pug“During the casting process, I decided I simply had to photograph the Turkish man who helps out in my local shop. He has an amazing beard but speaks hardly any English. It was impossible to explain to him that he reminds me of a miniature schnauzer.

Lesbian love finally conquers all.Philippa Gregory’s novels never disappoint. A historian fascinated by England’s royal women, she writes vividly about their lives, filling in the historical gaps by imagining what might have happened. Most recently I read The Last Tudor – a controversial portrait if, like me, you are a huge admirer of Elizabeth I. It tells the story of the three Gray sisters – Jane, Katherine and Mary – who were the most likely contenders for the throne. Jane, of course, was queen for just nine days before being executed. Her sisters, too, suffered terribly, as Elizabeth was jealous, determined and vindictive. At the same time as challenging Elizabeth’s reputation, the novel is a fascinating exposition of the lives of lesser-known women.Mary Beard has become something of a star when it comes to bringing classical history to life. She exposes the roots of today’s expectations of how a woman should behave. Women \u0026amp Power: A Manifesto is a small but wonderfully potent call to action. With references to mythological figures such as Perseus, Medusa, Philomela and Telemachus, she shows how often we’ve been told that “Speech will be the business of men” and that a woman who breaks this rule may risk having her tongue cut out. Time for change, she argues – and now!Patricia Duncker, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Manchester, brought James Miranda Barry to my attention in 1988. We’ve long assumed that Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was the first woman in Britain to qualify as a doctor. Not so, as Patricia Duncker’s eponymous novel explains. In the early 19th century, posing as a young man, Barry studied medicine in Edinburgh. She spent the rest of her life as a surgeon in the army, living all the while as a man. Her true sex was only discovered as her body was cleansed and laid out. She appeared to at some point have had a baby.Jacky Fleming is the wonderful cartoonist whose Be a Bloody Train Driver and Never Give Up have had me laughing over the years. In her latest book, The Trouble with Women, she ask questions such as: “Can women be geniuses or are their arms too short?”, and “Why did we only learn about three women at school? What were the others doing?” Good questions! • A History of the World in 21 Women: A Personal Selection by Jenni Murray is published by Oneworld."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a9791e8106d59ea649ab0a5804f678bfa8898d5/0_1295_3470_2082/master/3470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d8480f451f9ed5bb4b125afca905d11","title":"the end karl ove knausgaard my struggle volume six review","story":"Concluding a monumental literary journey, the Norwegian author’s soul-searching comes full circleAnd so seven years after its publication in Norway, the sixth and final part of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle series finally reaches British bookshops. Why it’s taken this long is unclear, though the fact that the 1,168-page tome has an additional translator (Martin Aitken) alongside Don Bartlett, who worked on the previous five alone, may just have something to do with it.In any case, the fittingly titled The End is worth the wait. Reimmersing myself in Knausgaard’s distinctive preoccupations, I wondered at first if I had lost the magnetic thread, that strange compulsion in the Norwegian’s sprawling prose that pulls the reader through epic sprees of navel-gazing. What more could he say about himself and his literary anxieties? With how many more cigarettes and cups of coffee could he fill his descriptions of quotidian life?The answer to all those questions, it turns out, is a lot. Knausgaard had written two volumes of My Struggle and was about to start work on the third, when the first – A Death in the Family – came out. Here, in the sixth, he records in what can only be called Knausgaardian detail the family feud and authorial crisis unleashed by that initial publication.His uncle accused him of making things up in the novel. That wouldn’t normally be a charge that would trouble a fiction writer. However, in this case, the author had set his heart on writing the “truth”, not just the emotional version of it, but also the factual, the real version. “The whole point of the novel,” he writes, “was to depict reality as it was.”And the uncle’s insistence that Knausgaard had invented material to embellish his story (later shown to be a false accusation) made him question his own memory and motivations, which in turn caused a kind of crippling ontological doubt.That and the intense public scrutiny to which the book was subjected in Norway led Knausgaard, by his own account, to be more restrained – and therefore less truthful – in volumes three, four and five. But in The End, he proclaims, he is determined to tell things as they are, regardless of the social costs.One aspect of this renewed boldness is a 400-page essay on the life, thoughts and appeal of Adolf Hitler. Where does that fit in with the travails of a novelist father of three living in Malmö, you might ask.Not seamlessly, although Knausgaard did borrow the title of his series from the Nazi leader’s notorious memoir. More significantly, the Norwegian is an avowed romantic, someone who feels uncomfortable with the rationalised pieties and hypocrisies of a modern society that extol the values of equality while egregiously privileging the inequalities of physical beauty. Repulsed by media saturation and ceaseless commercialisation, he yearns for the authentic, the essential, the transcendent.He’s not the first Nordic writer to do so. It’s the mainspring of German romanticism, this profound yearning, and somewhere within it is the purifying desire on which Hitler built his ultra-nationalistic cult, supported by many who should\u0026nbsphave known better, including the towering mind of the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Knausgaard explores this intellectual tradition and seeks to understand how a craving for authenticity resulted in industrialised genocide and the greatest horrors of the 20th century.It makes for an intense and demanding section, but I’d question whether Hitler and the Holocaust are subjects best suited to Knausgaard’s promiscuous intellect. For all his close reading of Hitler and various historians – his critique of Ian Kershaw’s work is more than an intriguing footnote – he never really gets to grips with the\u0026nbspsource or growth of the dictator’s demented antisemitism.Perhaps the scale of the undertaking is too great to be contained within a narrative of a writer’s struggle. The provocative irony of the title becomes, instead, a comparative study of two alienated young men – one who goes on to write a critically acclaimed international bestseller and the other to be responsible for the deaths of tens of millions.No amount of thoughtful analysis can square that imbalance. Yet Knausgaard is to be applauded for showing that the great mystery of the modern era – the descent of Germany into genocidal madness – is not a “they” but a “we” issue, even if it’s an argument that loses some of its force within the context of a resolutely “I” book.And never is that “I” more emphatically announced than in Knausgaard’s auto-criticism of his auto-fiction and, in particular, its real-life consequences for other people. It makes for a weird kind of feedback loop in which the author berates himself for his previous intrusions into others’ privacy while simultaneously trespassing once again.The most disturbing example is with Linda, his second wife, about whom he wrote in often negative terms in volume two, A Man in Love. Bipolar, with three young children, and struggling with a chronic lack of confidence as a writer herself, Linda suffers a breakdown and ends up in a psychiatric hospital. Yet as he castigates himself for the insensitivity of his earlier depictions of her, Knausgaard once again submits his wife to his unflattering gaze, creating a picture of an indolent, clinging woman steadily cutting off his freedom and stifling his creativity.That he subsequently declares that she is “a human being and her unique essence is indescribable” doesn’t lessen the damning nature of the portrait. For he has described her. You come away from the book with a powerful image of the ambitious artist trapped in a suffocating marriage, even as Knausgaard dutifully interrogates the meaning of ambition, art and marriage.Should the fact that the relationship ended a couple of years ago inform our reading of this book? Does that knowledge affect our appreciation of Knausgaard’s heroic attempt to get at the unvarnished experience of life as it is lived? It’s the sort of question on which he could probably hold forth for 20 paragraph-less pages.As Knausgaard is at pains to acknowledge, the complexity of life will always remain beyond the scope of even its most scrupulous documenter. Yet whatever distinctions one chooses to draw between an experience and its faithful, if inevitably subjective, depiction (and ultimately our minds\u0026nbspprocess both as stories), life\u0026nbspand art will always bleed into each other.If it’s just about conceivable that the reader might remain incurious, or at least ignorant, of the writer’s biography outside the text, there seems little doubt that that biography has been dramatically altered by the impact of the text – both in terms of fame and familial fallout.Writing about life, as Knausgaard notes, was his means of escaping from life. But the more he writes about his life, the more he is imprisoned by the self-consciousness that the endeavour demands and – through widespread public attention – supplies.By the end of the book, we can feel his growing desperation to be done with the task, to escape back to real life. He promises on the final page that he will never “do anything like this” to Linda and the children again. Whatever the truth of those words, his life is now destined to stand in the shadow of this truly monumental six-volume literary achievement. And perhaps there is no greater mark of artistic success than that.• The End by Karl Ove Knausgaard is published by Harvill Secker (£25).

It also increased its in-house design and buying teams for own-label goods. In total there are now just over 700 fewer employees across the group than a year ago – taking the total to just over 83,000 staff.The business, which owns a string of department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, is preparing to report on Thursday that it did not make any profit in the first six months of this year, compared to a £26.6m profit last year, as tough trading conditions on the high street take their toll.The company warned of the likely profits fall in June, blaming Brexit-fuelled inflation and the extra costs of investing in IT at a time when it has been forced to cut prices because of widespread discounting by ailing competitors such as House of Fraser. It expects full-year profits to be significantly down.Earlier this week, the  revealed the department-store side of the group planned to cut about 270 more jobs, just as it changed its name to “John Lewis \u0026amp Partners” to highlight ownership by its employees.The Gazette indicated that the number could be higher, as it revealed that 350 staff are being consulted about the changes which affect back-office jobs in IT, finance and store security for its 50 department stores.The group is also cutting costs at its head office, stopping investment in new stores, reviewing its pension arrangements and reining in marketing spending. At the same time, it intends to pump up to £500m a year into refurbishing its stores and website, as well as developing new products and services.Speaking last week, John Lewis department store boss Paula Nickolds said that despite the job cuts, the company was aiming to improve service in store.“We are determined to play the long game and our ownership model means we can,” Nickolds said on a tour of John Lewis’s revamped Oxford Street store in London.“While others are investing in drones, we are investing in people. Where others are cutting back, we are investing in the very thing that is our point of difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/152f81cc543f94e8de4aa3c3fd25138d55929962/867_640_3133_1880/master/3133.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e73a54668d8fa8f641df66fca23b016","title":"nearly 19000 uk earners now on more than 1m a year","story":"Number rises by 3,700 but many are foreign or non-doms who could leave after BrexitThe number of people in the UK earning more than £1m a year has jumped to over 18,700, with more than one in 10 of them living in Kensington and Chelsea, according to figures released by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs.The total increased by 3,700 in the latest available tax year, but there are concerns that many of the “highly mobile” high-earners could quit the UK in the wake of a messy Brexit.More than a third of all the £1m earners live in London, with more than 2,000 in Kensington and Chelsea, and 1,400 in the City of Westminster in the 2015-16 tax year. That’s according to HMRC figures obtained by the law firm Wilsons under freedom of information laws. The 2015-16 are the latest figures available.Wilsons’ analysis suggests that many of the £1m-plus earners are wealthy foreign executives, investors or non-doms who are domiciled overseas for tax purposes. They could leave the UK if immigration rules or taxes are tightened in the wake of Brexit.Tim Fullerlove, a partner at Wilsons, said: “London is still an attractive prospect for the wealthy, but a more welcoming culture in UK policies could help to retain its appeal.“Wealthy business executives, investors and non-doms from overseas are a boon for the UK economy, paying large amounts of taxes in the capital and generating jobs. Many high earners regard the UK as one of the most secure countries in which to hold their assets.“There is now a danger, however, that what some commentators are calling the ‘golden goose’ of wealthy investors is being taken for granted.“There could be a risk of losing non-doms to other jurisdictions if UK tax reliefs are not attractive to them. There are also concerns that visa rules could be tightened after Brexit, shutting off investors from overseas.”Non-dom status has been repeatedly criticised, for allowing some of the world’s wealthiest iniduals to live in Britain for years without paying UK tax on foreign income. Some non-doms have passed the status down between generations, dramatically cutting their tax bills.In 2015, the then-chancellor George Osborne announced a partial clampdown on the practice, hitting non-doms who were born in the UK or had lived in the country for more than 15 of the last 20 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae35d199967c744d174562842967bd3ca1fdfd7/0_170_5110_3066/master/5110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51fd43e90b042aa014a87a69eb445b83","title":"stock markets under pressure as us china trade tensions deepen business live","story":"Retail sales and services lift UK GDP growth to fastest in nearly a year, while production falls backBritain’s trade position also improved in July. The overall trade in goods deficit was the smallest since February, at £9.97bn, according to the ONS. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, said the bounceback in construction, which was hit hard by the “Beast from the East” during the winter, represented a much-needed boost to confidence in the sector. But he cautioned:Underlying growth remains fragile however, and the real test will be if this can be sustained in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies’ commitment to new projects over the last two years. In particular, separate figures published by the ONS recently show the lowest level of net migration from the EU since 2012, which has again raised concerns as to how construction will cope with a reduction of a skilled labour supply from the EU post-Brexit. If sustained growth is to be realised, then the industry will need the workforce with the right skills, but this is far from clear at present.Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, says:While not quite in rude health, the economy does look to have been on the up over the summer with consumers spurred on by some good weather and modest increases in real wages. Export demand also looks to have been a bit more supportive, consistent with some of the survey evidence over the summer. It is still unclear that there is enough momentum here to counteract what feels like a rising tide of uncertainty about Brexit and global trade policy concerns.”The statistics office’s head of GDP Rob Kent-Smith said: Growth in the economy picked up in the three months to July. Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup. The construction sector also bounced back after a weak start to the year.However, production fell back, with manufacturing again slipping a little while energy generation and supply fell due to reduced demand.The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level.The Office for National Statistics highlighted the good weather between May and July, citing Met Office data that this summer was the joint hottest summer in the UK since records began.China’s foreign ministry has reiterated that Beijing will respond if the US announces new tariffs on Chinese goods. On Friday, Donald Trump said he was ready to impose duties on pretty much all Chinese imports into the US.If the US said obstinately clings to its course and takes any new tariff measures against China, then the Chinese side will inevitably take countermeasures to resolutely protect our legitimate rights.The US and China imposed tariffs on $50bn of each other’s goods in early July after trade talks broke down. Trump then threatened tariffs on a further $200bn of Chinese goods, whereupon China unveiled a proposed list of retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of US goods in August. On Friday, Trump talked about another package of duties on $267bn of goods, escalating the trade war. This would include mobile phones, the biggest US import from China, for the first time. The $200bn list includes a broad range of consumer products such as cameras, luggage and vacuum cleaners, along with meat and fish, many metals and commodities.The existing and threatened tariffs cover $517bn of Chinese goods – which would exceed last year’s imports of $505bn from China.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, has sent us his thoughts on Debenhams:The rationale for combining the two to create the House of Debenhams is compelling enough. As previously noted, combining the two businesses, reducing overheads and at a stroke removing a key leg of competition, seems like the only viable solution for the two ailing department stores. The fact is the market is screaming for restructuring and consolidation looks a sensible route to take given the well documented structural pressures on the sector.Primark was held back by sales in “Northern Europe”, but the operating profit margin recovered well in the second half. In terms of new store expansion, the much-vaunted US operation continues to edge forward (with 9 stores now open), but the highlight is that the new UK site in the old Birmingham Pavilions centre will, at 160,000 sq ft, become the largest store in the whole Primark estate.Aston Martin, the luxury car brand favoured by James Bond, has strengthened its board with several experienced FTSE executives ahead of its planned stock market flotation. Its board will be chaired by former Royal Bank of Scotland director Penny Hughes. Richard Solomons, who ran InterContinental Hotels until last year, will serve as a senior independent director and chair the audit and risk committee.Imelda Walsh, the former HR director of Sainsbury’s who chairs the remuneration committee at transport firm FirstGroup the former Deutsche Bank and Deloitte director Peter Espenhahn and Lord Carrington, a director of the Arab British Chambers of Commerce, will also join the Aston Martin board as non-executive directors.The carmaker said it would release further details on the float, such as the indicative price range and the maximum number of shares to be sold, around 20 September.The department store chain called in administrators KPMG over the weekend to assess its options, including a company voluntary arrangement. This – also used by other retailers recently – would allow it to close stores and to renegotiate rents at others.The Turkish economy is expected to slow further in the second half, as the country battles with the fallout from its currency crisis. The lira has plummeted, partly due to concerns over president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s influence over monetary policy. Economists say the central bank should raise interest rates to rein in inflation, but Erdoğan has resisted this. The central bank meets on Thursday.The dollar is rising again amid mounting trade tensions, and the Swedish krona is also up following yesterday’s election.Sweden faces a protracted period of political uncertainty after an election that left the two main parliamentary blocs tied but well short of a majority, and the far-right Sweden Democrats promising to wield “real influence” in parliament despite making more modest gains than many had predicted.European stock markets have opened slightly lower. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says in his morning note:The trade numbers from Beijing are likely to have struck a nerve with Mr Trump, and given that he thinks the US are winning the trade spat on account of the recent weakness in the Chinese stock market, he is likely to stick to his protectionist line. Beijing said they would retaliate should the US impose fresh tariffs, and traders are fearful they might weaken the yuan or target US firms operating in China.Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, warned President Trump that if he continues down the route of protectionism, it could hurt the company’s profits. The tech sector has been the standout performer of the US market this year, but it has come under pressure recently on account of the update last week from Washington DC that tighter regulation would be required for the industry, and in particular social media stocks like Facebook and Twitter.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Tensions between the world’s two biggest economies over trade have deepened further, after China revealed a record trade surplus with the US on Saturday. Customs data showed it jumped to $31.05bn in August from $28.09bn in July, while overall export growth slowed to the slowest pace since March.Donald Trump is yet to activate the threatened fresh tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods imported to the US, but on Friday suggested duties on a further $267bn could be imposed. Hours before his threats, China announced measures to support some of the exporters affected by higher duties. Beijing has warned that it will retaliate, but has limited room to do so.Analysts at JPMorgan said:The overall sense is that the United States will continue to escalate the pressure until China submits to US demands which does not seem likely any time soon. Overall, the impact of tariffs and high levels of uncertainty will both continue to weigh on markets into the end of the year.European shares are set for a mixed open.A barrage of figures, all out at 9.30am BST, will shed some light on the health of the UK economy: monthly GDP for July, along with trade, manufacturing and industrial production and construction.

Unnecessarily so, given that it has visited and revisited principles of good coverage, repeatedly arriving at more or less the same conclusions.Back in 2007, a report for the BBC Trust, then the corporation’s regulator, concluded that the old bipolar world of “the climate change debate” had gone. The working model had to change, as the title put it, From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel : “the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus. But these dissenters (or even sceptics) will still be heard, as they should.” Four years later, the Trust’s review of accuracy and impartiality in science coverage , commissioned from geneticist Professor Steve Jones, reached very similar conclusions.Both reports were accepted by BBC managers. Both contain much that is common sense. And then there are the editorial guidelines, which are very clear that the guiding principle is “due impartiality”, rather than equal weight.So how have we reached a situation in which the BBC has to apologise  for not challenging incorrect statements made by Lord Lawson on the Today programme, where an entire Radio 4 feature, What’s the Point of the Met Office?, turns into a polemic about “dodgy” climate science, and where Radio Cambridgeshire finds it appropriate to stage a traditional seesaw-style debate between “warmist” and “sceptic”?One answer is that the BBC has failed to promulgate its “big thinking” on editorial matters to producers and presenters, very few of whom have a science background. After the Jones Review it set up seminars on science coverage but it failed to make them mandatory, and scrapped them after a year. Staff come and staff go it seems extremely unlikely that Sarah Sands, editor of Today, had read either the Jones Review or From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel when she decided to call Nigel Lawson for “that” interview.I recently argued for the seminars’ reinstatement and for making them mandatory. Not that I’m claiming credit, but as the CarbonBrief website has reported, the BBC has now done something similar – setting up a new one-hour course on reporting climate change “… covering the latest science, policy, research, and misconceptions to challenge, giving you confidence to cover the topic accurately and knowledgeably”.The basic briefing document for the course is short, but it’s a good start. “Climate change is happening” there is a range of possible temperature rises for any given level of carbon emissions one cold winter does not challenge the overall picture and so on. Unchallengeable, really.If the courses are implemented well, they should improve matters still further. I say “still further” because the lapses to which I referred earlier are conspicuous by their rarity. There’s been a lot of climate change coverage this summer, and the vast majority that I’ve seen has been exemplary. But if this initiative can, for example, make sure that Today presenters know that inidual extreme weather events are now routinely being linked to climate change, as Nick Robinson appeared not to know when talking about the heatwave recently, that will be a step forward.Climate science, though, is just part of the picture. The corporation’s coverage of energy could do with an infusion of new thinking on issues linked to climate change. Mercifully the stream of claims that “the lights will go out” as Britain adopts more and more renewable energy appears to have stopped. But which of the BBC’s correspondents knows that energy bills have gone down over the past decade? Not those who last year covered the government-commissioned Helm Review of energy prices, which led to Radio 4 claiming that “bills have doubled over the past decade”. Where is coverage, also, of the existential risk posed to oil companies – and therefore our pension funds – by the tumbling prices of renewable energy and electric cars? This is now standard fare for the FT, Economist, , Reuters, Bloomberg … But the BBC has yet to catch on that a transformation of the entire global energy system is a big story.The other major factor behind the BBC’s occasional troubles on climate change is lobbying. The newspaper commentariat is amply stocked with columnists who routinely lambast the corporation for bias and the weight of rhetoric has had an impact.This, I think, is the real takeaway from the CarbonBrief news: the BBC has decided that it no longer cares about groundless criticism. I assume that the first fulmination against this new course will be in print this weekend or early next week, doubtless full of words such as “indoctrination”. The BBC will be accused of “stifling debate”, even though the course material is clear that it is not. Probably the identity of the “shadowy” figures behind this initiative will be sought.The reality is, though, that climate and energy contrarians are exerting less and less influence on media or politics. As the BBC’s online briefing notes, the government is now taking advice on whether to set a net-zero emissions target in law, not debating whether climate change matters. If BBC bosses have decided that from now on they are going to free output from the occasional grip of the UK’s climate contrarian elite and stand up for evidence – good on them.• Richard Black is director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, and a former BBC science and environment correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec2aacddee4c3456d61eb48e71db89db0391e8b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5f0076bbf15ff0b0831f933b1f73be5","title":"populists rise progressives radical right","story":"These are unsettled times for democratic politics. Shocked by the victory of Eurosceptic coalitions in Austria and in Italy, the neoliberal elites – already worried by the Brexit vote and the victory of Donald Trump – now claim democracy is in danger and raise the alarm against a possible return of “fascism”.There is no denying that western Europe is currently witnessing a “populist moment”. This arises from the multiplication of anti-establishment movements, which signal a crisis of neoliberal hegemony. This crisis might indeed open the way for more authoritarian governments, but it can also provide the opportunity for reclaiming and deepening the democratic institutions that have been weakened by 30 years of neoliberalism.Our current post-democratic condition is the product of several phenomena. The first one, which I call “post-politics”, is the blurring of frontiers between right and left. It is the result of the consensus established between parties of centre-right and centre-left on the idea that there was no alternative to neoliberal globalisation. Under the imperative of “modernisation”, social democrats have accepted the diktats of globalised financial capitalism and the limits it imposes on state intervention and public policies.Politics has become a mere technical issue of managing the established order, a domain reserved for experts. The sovereignty of the people, a notion at the heart of the democratic ideal, has been declared obsolete. Post-politics only allows for an alternation in power between the centre-right and the centre-left. The confrontation between different political projects, crucial for democracy, has been eliminated.This post-political evolution has been characterised by the dominance of the financial sector, with disastrous consequences for the productive economy. This has been accompanied by privatisation and deregulation policies that, jointly with the austerity measures imposed after the 2008 crisis, have provoked an exponential increase in inequality.The working class and the already disadvantaged are particularly affected, but also a significant part of the middle classes, who have become poorer and more insecure. In recent years, various resistance movements have emerged. They embody what Karl Polanyi presented in The Great Transformation as a “countermovement”, by which society reacts against the process of marketisation and pushes for social protection. This countermovement, he pointed out, could take progressive or regressive forms. This ambivalence is also true of today’s populist moment. In several European countries those resistances have been captured by rightwing parties that have articulated, in a nationalistic and xenophobic vocabulary, the demands of those abandoned by the centre-left. Rightwing populists proclaim they will give back to the people the voice that has been captured by the “elites”. They understand that politics is always partisan and requires an usthem confrontation. Furthermore, they recognise the need to mobilise the realm of emotion and sentiment in order to construct collective political identities. Drawing a line between the “people” and the “establishment”, they openly reject the post-political consensus.Those are precisely the political moves that most parties of the left feel unable to make, owing to their consensual concept of politics and the rationalistic view that passions have to be excluded. For them, only rational debate is acceptable. This explains their hostility to populism, which they associate with demagogy and irrationality. Alas, the challenge of rightwing populism will not be met by stubbornly upholding the post-political consensus and despising the “deplorables”.It is vital to realise that the moral condemnation and demonisation of rightwing populism is totally counterproductive – it merely reinforces anti-establishment feelings among those who lack a vocabulary to formulate what are, at core, genuine grievances.Classifying rightwing populist parties as “extreme right” or “fascist”, presenting them as a kind of moral disease and attributing their appeal to a lack of education is, of course, very convenient for the centre-left. It allows them to dismiss any populists’ demands and to avoid acknowledging responsibility for their rise.The only way to fight rightwing populism is to give a progressive answer to the demands they are expressing in a xenophobic language. This means recognising the existence of a democratic nucleus in those demands and the possibility, through a different discourse, of articulating those demands in a radical democratic direction.This is the political strategy that I call “left populism”. Its purpose is the construction of a collective will, a “people” whose adversary is the “oligarchy”, the force that sustains the neoliberal order.It cannot be formulated through the leftright cleavage, as traditionally configured. Unlike the struggles characteristic of the era of Fordist capitalism, when there was a working class that defended its specific interests, resistances have developed beyond the industrial sector. Their demands no longer correspond to defined social groups. Many touch on questions related to quality of life and intersect with issues such as sexism, racism and other forms of domination. With such ersity, the traditional leftright frontier can no longer articulate a collective will.To bring these erse struggles together requires establishing a bond between social movements and a new type of party to create a “people” fighting for equality and social justice.We find such a political strategy in movements such as Podemos in Spain, La France Insoumise of Jean-Luc Mélenchon, or Bernie Sanders in the US. This also informs the politics of Jeremy Corbyn, whose endeavour to transform the Labour party into a great popular movement, working “for the many, not the few”, has already succeeded in making it the greatest left party in Europe.Those movements seek to come to power through elections, but not in order to establish a “populist regime”. Their goal is to recover and deepen democratic institutions. This strategy will take different forms: it could be called “democratic socialism”, “eco-socialism”, “liberal socialism” or “participatory democracy”, depending on the different national context. But what is important, whatever the name, is that “democracy” is the signifier around which these struggles are articulated, and that political liberal institutions are not discarded.The process of radicalising democratic institutions will no doubt include moments of rupture and a confrontation with the dominant economic interests. It is a radical reformist strategy with an anti-capitalist dimension, but does not require relinquishing liberal democratic institutions.I am convinced that in the next few years the central axis of the political conflict will be between rightwing populism and leftwing populism, and it is imperative that progressive sectors understand the importance of involving themselves in that struggle.The popularity in the June 2017 parliamentary elections of Mélenchon, François Ruffin and other candidates of La France Insoumise – including in Marseille and Amiens, previous strongholds of Marine Le Pen – shows that when an egalitarian discourse is available to express their grievances, many people join the progressive struggle. Conceived around radical democratic objectives, populism, far from being a perversion of democracy – a view that the forces defending the status quo try to impose by disqualifying as “extremists” all those who oppose the post-political consensus – constitutes in today’s Europe the best political strategy for reviving and expanding our democratic ideals.• Chantal Mouffe is professor of political theory at the University of Westminster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df82ace41f9409d2c74aff3152ed7adb57ae43fe/0_136_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=775a733600b09db9d4767c5d356a22cd","title":"university working class divide academics","story":"Too many poorer students feel they don’t fit in at university. We need more academics proud to be from a similar backgroundAs the new university year approaches, it seems the adage “not for the likes of us” remains\u0026nbsppertinent for working-class students. Figures on participation rates in higher education clearly show that although numbers are rising, universities are still attracting a lower proportion of working-class women and men, based on socio-economic classifications. This is despite\u0026nbspa slew of thinktank proposals on how higher education institutions could encourage more working-class students.A major problem is cost. I know from talking to students from poorer backgrounds that the £9,000-plus fees, with accommodation and living expenses on top, strike fear into them and their parents alike. Yet it’s not just the exorbitant cost. It is the fear of not fitting in that can put prospective working-class students off from applying. And they are more likely to drop out even if they do get in, because they can feel they don’t fit in to the unfamiliar surroundings. This unwelcoming environment isn’t confined to common rooms, bars and sports fields, where no one may speak or behave like them. It also emanates from the lecture halls and classrooms, where there are few academics who sound or look like them.Working-class students and academics can often be seen as outsiders and feel alienated in these institutions. We don’t know how many working-class academics there are, as figures are not collated, but my experience as one tells me they are underrepresented. My anecdotal evidence cannot be substituted for research, but students from poorer backgrounds do have the added pressure of trying to conform to middle-class values while they study. This is hardly a recipe for academic success and also raises questions about whether poorer students can form grounded and productive intellectual relationships with lecturers who may have very different cultural values.As a working-class woman from a state comprehensive in West Yorkshire, with a few low-ranking GCSEs and no A-levels, I felt all at sea when I went to a university down south. My accent stood out like a sore thumb and my lack of previous education meant I got the lowest mark in the first exam I took, forcing me to rethink my time there. I could easily have dropped out. But I was extremely lucky because at each of the two institutions I studied there were female teachers who had similar backgrounds to mine to whom I could connect. They understood my lack of confidence and devoted time and energy to what can only be described as my voracious and insatiable interest in history. They supported me to progress and to win prizes, a scholarship and finally achieve a doctorate.When I began teaching, more than a decade ago, I was very keen to retain my northern accent and working-class credentials. I didn’t want to change to “fit in” with the middle-class teaching teams because I felt it was important to show students that intellectual capability isn’t related to a southern accent, or to middle-class values. Cleaning a pub for a living and stacking supermarket shelves did not take away from my PhD and subsequent scholarship.One way to increase the number of working-class students would be to employ more academics from similar backgrounds. This would make students feel\u0026nbspless\u0026nbspalienated and more at home. But it’s not so easy\u0026nbspto appoint more when many academics don’t admit\u0026nbspto their class. I was determined to be working class, northern and educated. But some hide their background, changing their accent, dress and taste. Do they fear discrimination?Most lecturers of all classes experience “impostor syndrome” at some point, but I feel they should be confident that intellect is not shaped by class. I hope many of them eventually come out of the closet for the sake of improving the learning environment for poorer students. Otherwise very few working-class youngsters will have the role models to inspire them to achieve a successful academic career. Of course, not all students wish to teach, nor progress up the academic ladder. Many are hoping to land a much higher-paid job. However, the lack of working-class academics sends a clear message about the value of their teaching qualities compared with their middle-class peers.Class Matters and Care-Less Spaces, the potted histories of working-class female academics, reveal that they have to prove themselves to a much higher degree than their middle-class peers, are less likely to hold high positions or lead projects, and experience a lack of a sense of “care, generosity and respect”. Perhaps this is why there are still so few of them.Appointing more will not immediately bring thousands of new working-class freshers through the academic portals, but it would demonstrate that universities are encouraging working-class intellectual inquiry. The power of higher education has led to huge improvements in middle-class women’s opportunities and influence on the world. It could have the same impact on working-class women’s lives. Through access to higher education they could find their political legacy, be able to govern their own lives, and make a greater mark on ours.• Melanie Reynolds is an associate lecturer at Oxford Brookes University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=977faa7e64239d57a7a37e8c4b22be62","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

And why should we care? Author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, Emma Gannon, explainsAlex Haddow, a comedian and picture editor, agrees: “I feel that by doing lots of things that pique my interest all the time, I get the most out of everything,” she says. “And because that keeps my interest up, I put more into them and get better results.”At the same time, the internet has given us access to a myriad of free tools and a huge global audience of potential customers and clients, whether using e-commerce hubs such as ebay, or building a following via social media – making many business ideas more viable than before. Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work. After all, says Sarah Kingston, writer, consultant and owner of a marketing agency: “I get to be creative, challenged and excited about what I do.

Want to get in on the action? From planning and packaging to photography and postage, here’s how to start your own online empireBuilding a business on ebay is like building any business – it takes passion, determination and hard work. But the difference with building a business on ebay is that the platform has been designed to help you, and with ebay’s business tools and its step-by-step guides to using them, you’ll be on track to ebay success before you can say “Buy it Now”.Research and planningFirst, you need to do some research. Filter by “Sold Items” on the ebay app or go through “Advanced Search” on desktop to see what items like yours have sold for. As well as scoping out your competitors, this is an easy way to explore the site and get a feel for how it works.Once you’ve got a sense of the price bracket your product is in, you can add your postage and packaging costs. Remember to consider other practicalities such as where you will keep your goods and how quickly they can be dispatched to your customers.Once you’ve worked out the details, it’s time to open up ebay and PayPal accounts and register with HMRC. Check HMRC’s website for details on how and when to get VAT registered. And voila – you’re now an ebay business seller!Get advice from the sourceOn top of the direct access to millions of potential customers around the world, ebay’s Seller Hub and its smart suite of marketing and growth tools make it a powerful platform for starting a business. But before you can make the most of them, you need to know how to use them.The ebay Seller Centre is the best place to start. It is straightforward and helpful, advising you on the different levels of engagement, the fee structure and what you get for your money. Look at the ebay tools on offer and think about what you need at this point – some will be more useful now, some you’ll want to call on later.FeedbackThis can have a huge impact on your business, so you’ll want to make sure that you keep your customer feedback positive. Fortunately, this is largely down to being organised and good at communication – these are the keys to customer service. If your items are of good quality, accurately described, dispatched on time and delivered when and where you say they will be, you’ll be well on your way to building the relationships and reputation a successful business and brand needs.Respond quickly to any customer queries that come up on “Ask the Seller a Question” ship immediately once the payment is received and let your buyer know when their goods are on the way. Finally, restrict your communications with buyers to ebay’s internal messaging system – it acts as a safety net. Build a brandLook at what catches your attention on the site and gets the right message across. Aim for a username and an image that reflect your business and will be an easy search for potential customers. Any logo should reflect this – and the item and shop description should clearly highlight what you sell and make it attractive to potential customers.Make your photography as clear as possible by shooting items in natural light against a white background. You can have up to 12 images for each item, so shoot from different angles, add a ruler if you need to indicate size, and remember that no words are allowed on photos. These images should represent your products authentically and accurately – this should minimise returns.Learn the languageGetting the title right on all items you sell is vitally important – particularly if you’re selling your own products to a new market. After that, it’s all about your product description. Imagine you’ve just started selling your own range of homemade face creams what are you going to tell your potential customers about them? First, make sure all of the basic details are spelled out as clearly as possible, such as the core name of the product and the quantity or volume of the units you are selling.Next it’s about how you want the product to be perceived. Taking the face cream business as an example, be mindful not to append superlatives such as “miracle” or “wonder” to the product description. If you’re selling something you’ve made yourself, no matter how special or effective the formula that you’ve come up with may be, you’re much better off describing something as “artisan” or “small batch”. Not only will this be more accurate, but it will also sound more realistic and authentic – an important consideration when building your brand and gaining consumer trust.But ebay also does some of the work for you – when you start selling, the platform will autopopulate various category options for you based on similar items, from which you can review and choose the most relevant for your product.Start smallBefore throwing yourself into huge numbers of orders, it’s important to make sure that you’ve got a handle on fulfilling your promises and offering a good service. So it’s better to start small to make sure you get a good idea of how to do things right. Remember, too, that as soon as you’re a business seller, you’ll need to offer returns on all of your products, so iron out that process as well. Then, once things are running smoothly, you’ll know the time is right to start putting a few more items up for sale. Keep on top of things and plan ahead relentlesslyKeep planning. Growing a business on ebay needs the same dedication and attention to detail as planning any other enterprise, so always stay on top of costs, profits and time management. Write a business plan, so you know exactly what you want to achieve.Finally, remember to keep a checklist, day in, day out. People do this in different ways: while some opt for the classic pen, paper, and Post-its or the always stylish Moleskine diary, others are taking advantage of the plethora of great organiser apps, such as Todoist, to keep on top of things. Whichever option works for you, the most important thing is to know what’s coming up and how to prioritise things.Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

But it’s hard not to note, when it comes to the movies, that the “G” rather disproportionately dwarfs the initialism’s other letters. Female-focused queer releases such as Carol or this week’s The Miseducation of Cameron Post remain a minority within a minority cinema the patriarchy is a hard institution to shake.Naturally, it’s an imbalance that extends to the streaming world too, as LGBT-oriented streaming services cater more generously for a male gaze than a female one. That includes such outlets as the expressly gay-focused Dekkoo, which mixes worthwhile classics and international indies from the festival circuit – seek out the lovely, heartsore German marital drama Paths, for example – with ropier softcore fare. A sparklier platform Revry, launched two years ago, aims for greater queer inclusivity – it houses a lot of drag-related content, in particular – but still winds up giving women shorter shrift.So it’s not surprising that a couple of attempts have been made at launching a lesbian-specific streaming service, where gay women needn’t look to the margins to see their own stories on screen. None has been comprehensive, however. A few years back, the austerely named Section II launched, and hopeful claims were made for it as “the lesbian Netflix”, though anyone approaching it as such may be a bit disappointed. Its film section looks promising, with a menu boasting such tasty offerings as Dee Rees’s Pariah and Céline Sciamma’s Tomboy, but a lack of maintenance andor budget has led to a lot of dead links or teasing recommendations to other platforms.Clearly original content has been easier to produce and retain. Section II houses several appealingly low-key films, web series and one-offs, including a ribald comedy special with standup Julie Goldman, and Brides to Be, a romantic mystery ambitiously conceived on a shoestring.More recently, a lesbian-directed subscription service, Tello Films, has taken the lead in that regard, assembling a substantial collection of original reality shows and drama web series. One of them, the salty, spiky Secs and Execs, recently received an Emmy nomination in the short-form field. With a spry ensemble headed by Sandra Bernhard, it covers workplace tensions at a women’s sportswear company from both ends of the power ladder. Tello’s film selection is anaemic if pleasingly international in scope, including such otherwise little-exposed items as the South African apartheid-era love story The World Unseen.It’s a service evidently laying foundations for bigger things. Perhaps the market may yet provide more comprehensive viewing hubs for the “L” quadrant, or even a more alphabetically all-encompassing streaming service for the queer community at large. (Niche networks are all well and good, but as monthly subscription fees pile up, larger, more erse libraries make economic sense.) Netflix may do a better job than most of presenting and identifying content of LGBT interest to viewers, but true representation in the streaming world is still very much at the experimenting stage.Zama (Drakes Avenue, 15)Elusive Argentinian Lucrecia Martel continues to prove herself one of the most madly brilliant film-makers alive with this challenging but sensually overwhelming post-colonial fever dream (right).A Star Is Born (Warner Bros, 15)Bradley Cooper’s terrific revival of this Hollywood chestnut is a month away, making this restored release of its brashest, loopiest, Streisand-est incarnation perfectly timed.Mary and the Witch’s Flower (Altitude, PG)The inaugural release from Studio Ponoc, the new Japanese animation studio founded by Studio Ghibli refugees, captures some of the old magic with this dizzy fairytale.Cold Water (Sony, 15)One of the Criterion Collection’s most welcome recent coups, a gleaming restoration of Olivier Assayas’s exquisite, autobiographical, long-unavailable Parisian coming-of-age vision.Racer and the Jailbird (Thunderbird, 15)The old-school B-movie plot is irrelevant hokum it’s a basic framework over which to drape the gorgeous, sinuous star chemistry of Matthias Schoenaerts and Adèle Exarchopoulos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8a5e64cd710774e1e9b5cac8f8ecae46a30a4ec/66_57_1804_1082/master/1804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43edc9cefc3ddb04d5914e0d232e8a6b","title":"alex mcleish scotland albania nations league","story":"• Scotland have won just one match in previous five • McLeish: ‘This is where it really begins’It would be unfair – for now – to draw comparisons between this Scotland setup and Only Fools and Horses. Nonetheless, smiles were inevitable on Sunday as Alex McLeish delved into territory once reserved for Del Boy Trotter. “This time next year …” said the Scotland manager, with a laugh of his own.The serious matter, and cause for McLeish’s point, relates to a fraught start to his second Scotland tenure. Five friendly matches have passed with just a single Scotland goal and winning total which sits at the same. Monday evening’s visit of Albania to Hampden Park for the start of Scotland’s Nations League campaign carries strong significance in respect of McLeish’s reputation.“The Russian coach didn’t win in seven games then had a fantastic World Cup finals,” McLeish said. “I take inspiration from things like that. Michael O’Neill won one in 18 at the start with Northern Ireland and he turned out a national hero.” This time next year, indeed.Scotland’s last outing, the 4-0 loss to Belgium on Friday, didn’t boost external confidence. Less than 20,000 are expected for the Albania tie, meaning we would witness the lowest Hampden crowd for a competitive Scotland match in living memory. Disenchantment with the national team, it must be noted, set in long before McLeish took office in February.“We’re ready to go again,” he insisted. “This is it for real now. I can feel it already. I woke up on Sunday morning and said to myself: ‘This is where it really begins.’ We have done some experimenting, looking at different players and we have a big roster now should we need to call people up.“But this is it. The guys have got to bring their best performance level on Monday night.”Unlike the Scots, Albania have featured in a major tournament recently, but they currently have a lower Fifa ranking (58) than their hosts (40). The team managed by Christian Panucci will inevitably be in good spirits, having seen off Israel on Friday.McLeish is correct to highlight the need for defensive obduracy. The regimes of his immediate predecessors were commonly undermined by on-field generosity. McLeish has reverted to a back three, largely to accommodate both Kieran Tierney and Andy Robertson. That system is here to stay.“I take examples from other teams and countries,” McLeish said. “There are players around who are flexible enough to play in specific roles. There is no evidence to say that if we’d played 4-4-2 against Belgium we couldn’t have been beaten 5-0.“If we’d been 4-4-2 and got a doing then people would have been asking if I was thinking about changing the system. I know how it works but I’ve got to persevere. One thing I’ve done throughout my life, in terms of out on the pitch, is that if things aren’t right for me I never give up. I persevere. And I’m going to persevere with this formation.”McLeish and Panucci have Hampden history. In 2007, McLeish’s Scotland lost a European Championship qualifier to Italy, with Panucci scoring a hotly contested winner after the award of a controversial free-kick. There had also been an unusual pre-game incident.“A female Italian journalist called me and said: ‘Do you really think Scotland will get to the finals without Italy getting all the 5050 decisions?’” McLeish recalled. “I said: ‘We don’t talk like that in this country’ and she says: ‘It’s normal to talk like that in Italy.’“I phoned someone to ask what they thought and he said: ‘That’s just the way they write things over there. They expect the decisions.’”He added: “I was so incensed by that free-kick decision for Italy at the end that I kept in touch with what happened to the referee. He was supposed to be getting the Champions League semi-finals and he didn’t get them because of that decision. That’s what I was told anyway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f058d3826ec6162efa032b53d940880a9396b038/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=467d79d99fba1ace553dcaaa367ad78a","title":"mel b is watching flashing lights to help with trauma but does emdr therapy really work","story":"The singer is trying it, and while it was once controversial, it now has NHS approval. What is Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing, and how does it compare to CBT?In late 2016, Ben had a breakdown, triggered by someone getting too close to him on a crowded train. It brought on vivid flashbacks of a severe childhood trauma 30 years ago. Until then he had lived a successful life – he had done well at school, had a good career and was married with a family. Referred to a trauma clinic at his local hospital, Ben started a psychotherapy treatment, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) earlier this year. It sounded, he says: “like witchcraft. How can this possibly work? They sit you in front of flashing lights and it makes you better? It sounds like alchemy.”EMDR was recently highlighted by the pop singer Mel B, who is said to be undergoing the therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Talking about her diagnosis, a condition she had been using sex and alcohol to self-treat, she said: “I am still struggling but if I can shine a light on the issue of pain, PTSD and the things men and women do to mask it, I will do”. Of the EMDR, she said: “So far, it’s really helping me.”EMDR works, says Robin Logie, clinical psychologist and former president of the EMDR Association, by helping the brain to process traumatic memories – it is mainly used as a treatment for PTSD, but can be used for depression, anxiety, addiction and phobias. “The way we do that is to get the person to think about a particular moment. For example, with a road traffic accident – it could be the moment just before you’re hit. We ask them to describe what negative belief they have about themselves.” It could be something like: ‘I’m not safe.’” We ask what emotion seems to go with that and where they feel it in their body.”While the person is doing all this, they are asked to move their eyes from side to side – this could be by following the therapist’s finger, or following flashing lights. It can also be done by holding a device in each hand, which pulses alternately. Each set could be repeated 20 or 30 times in each session. “The memory starts to become less distressing,” he says. “It transforms it from a memory that previously made you feel anxious or scared, into a memory that is like any other that wouldn’t normally produce an emotional response. People start to be more rational about it: ‘I wasn’t in a safe situation then, but I’m safe now.’”In the early stages of treatment, says Ben: “It was like being in the event. It’s like a kind of time travel. The whole EMDR process is like a controlled flashback – you’re aware that you’re here and now, but you also feel like you’re in the body from then and re-experiencing as then. I was not prepared for the physical, visceral nature of reliving the experience. I would be seeing things, smelling things. I felt this pressure across my front and it was unnerving.”As the treatment went on, the memories became more and more vivid and detailed. It has, unsurprisingly, been a difficult process to go through, and Ben’s mental health seemed to get worse before it started to get better. He is still going through treatment. “It’s a process I have found genuinely transformative,” he says.EMDR was discovered by accident in the late 80s by an American psychologist, Francine Shapiro, who noticed that her eye movements, while looking at things on a walk through a park, appeared to reduce negative emotions. It used to be considered controversial but that is now an outdated view, says Melanie Temple, consultant psychiatrist and EMDR consultant (it is approved for use by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).One of the problems for EMDR is that nobody can explain exactly how it works – one theory is that the eye movements mimic the rapid-eye-movement phase of sleep, which is when the day’s events are processed. “We understand it works on the information-processing models within the brain, but we don’t know exactly how,” says Temple. “But then we don’t know exactly how cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) works. It’s really the same for all therapies.”Not everyone is ready for EMDR. “If someone has had a simple one-off trauma, such as an accident, in their adult life, you don’t need to do a lot of preparation, but we also work with people who have multiple traumas going back to early childhood,” says Logie. “With people like that you have to do more preparation and the therapy will last longer.” Preparing someone to undergo EMDR can include teaching them relaxation techniques, and strengthening the support structures in their lives.If not properly used, says Claudia Herbert, clinical psychologist and managing director of the Oxford Development Centre and author of Overcoming Traumatic Stress: “Any type of therapy can be re-traumatising. It has to be used by someone who is properly trained and experienced to know when to use it and not to use it.” It wouldn’t be used with someone who was dissociated – one symptom of PTSD – where they are not “grounded” in their body, or feel disoriented. “We would have to work with the dissociation first before we work with EMDR.”For Katherine Gilmartin, an artist and family mental health activist, diagnosed with complex PTSD as a\u0026nbspresult of childhood abuse, EMDR couldn’t begin immediately. “I was asked to think of somewhere I’d felt safe in the past. There was nothing,” she says. “So I had to make one.” She says EMDR, which she had once a week for more than six months, was “physically exhausting. The heightened experience of being in those traumatic memories whirls\u0026nbspeverything up and nightmares\u0026nbspoccur.”Although it can be powerful and effective, people shouldn’t expect a magical quick fix, she says. Ben has had more than 30 sessions and does not know when he will stop. “It’s had a hugely beneficial effect,” he says. Although the two or three days after each session are, he says, a “write-off”, he has been able to go back to work part-time. “I have moved from being this ventriloquist’s dummy for the child inside, to being an adult looking at what was happening being really sad and upset and angry about it, but having a natural emotional reaction, rather than feeling the distress of it happening to me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf37a182e3264994957cdb62439a1ed8a0a387c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55105ac675dbc3b59d55c8d075c527ac","title":"my partner used escorts for 10 years when he was single can i trust him now","story":"I worry that such behaviour is a sign he’s incapable of emotional intimacy, but he won’t discuss it and says I’m questioning his morals and sexualityMy partner and I are both 50 and have been together for 18 months. Three months ago, he let slip that he had visited escorts for 10 years while in his 30s and single. I was stunned. All he has said since is that he paid for sex once or twice a month. He won’t reopen the topic because he says I am questioning his morals and sexuality. I find him more emotionally distant than usual. He had a difficult childhood (both his parents were alcoholics), but refuses either inidual or couples counselling. However, he is faithful, hardworking, reliable and intelligent. (He watches porn, which I have accepted.) Now I wonder: is he trustworthy? What if he kept quiet to protect someone else? Is a decade of transactional sex a sign that he is incapable of emotional intimacy?Try to focus on who he is now, rather than how he might have been 20 years ago. People change and grow. They have different needs and styles at different points in their lives, and most become more sexually mature as they age. A history of hiring escorts in his 30s does not render him untrustworthy. It might, for example, have been an expedient choice for someone wanting occasional sex, but too busy to date.He does not want you to judge him for that, and perhaps he even feels shame about it. Maybe he was less capable of intimacy or of sustaining a relationship back then, but such things can be learned over time. When you are with him, try to enjoy the present rather than allowing your anxieties about the past or the future to fester. In general, if you allow yourself to be consumed with fears and suspicions, you will sabotage your chance to be happy. On the other hand, listen to your deep feelings if you truly believe he is untrustworthy, trust your intuition.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@the (please don’t send attachments).

On a Sunday in June, eight students sit in a yellow painted classroom, watching a mastiff named Axel sniff a bust of the Buddha.“C’mere, Axel,” says a woman whose T-shirt reads: “Medicine heals the body. DOGS heal the soul.” She offers him a treat. “Good boy.”Axel slobbers on her lap, then lopes around the room, sniffing amethyst crystals, a conga drum and a gold Tibetan singing bowl.“Send your heartstrings out,” says Natalie Anderson, a special education teacher who moonlights as an animal communicator. “Connect. Ask Axel: what’s in his world? What does he know? What does he want? Don’t be shy.”Axel drools on the rug as the students try to read his mind.“He’s saying ‘hikes’,” says one woman. “He wants a job, so he feels like he has a purpose. Maybe he can get a backpack, so his job can be carrying water on hikes?”A description of this seven-hour “pet communication” class reads: “You will learn how to send thoughts to your animal companions and trust what you are receiving back. It is only a matter of understanding telepathic communication, the natural mode of communication for all animals AND an inherent ability for all humans!”“Say whatever’s coming to mind,” Natalie instructs. “Give me that spirit vomit.”“He wants a playmate. And some variety in his dog food.”Axel sniffs a rock painted with a butterfly and the word “BELIEVE”. A lava lamp glows on a wooden chest. On the wall, a clock with the words “I SEE DEAD PEOPLE” printed on its face reads 3pm. It’s time for Axel’s afternoon walk.“Bye, Axel!” the students say. “Thanks so much!”Montclair Psychic School was founded by a woman named Lee Van Zyl in 2006 on the premise that every single person has “psychic abilities”. The definition varies depending on whom you ask but here, in addition to animal telepathy, the school offers instruction in angel-channeling, mind-reading, psychometry and communication with spirits of the dead.I first heard the claim that everyone could become psychic – a popular claim among scattered factions of the New Age movement – while working on an assignment in 2015. A Norse rune reader told me I possessed “dark magic” a crystal ball reader told me I was “very psychic” a dominatrix-slash-medium told me I was a latent witch.I didn’t believe any of them aside from going through a Wiccan phase at 11 and having a psilocybin-induced mystical experience on a golf course at 18, I’d never strayed much from a secular worldview. But I was secretly flattered – until I realized that most of these psychics’ clients probably got similar evaluations.According to them, most people just aren’t aware of their innate paranormal abilities.I wanted to know what would happen if I took these psychic evangelists at their word. Maybe the Norse rune reader was right, and my mind was infinitely more powerful than I’d ever fathomed. Or, as most of my friends insisted after learning of this project, maybe all psychics are charlatans.So from January to June of 2018, when I wasn’t at my job as a fact-checker, I listened to the podcast Everyone is Psychic read books like Your Psychic Soul and You Are Psychic! and attended “psychic development” classes promising students they would speak with the dead, see the future, or know for certain what’s inside others’ minds.On a freezing Tuesday in January, I attend a class called Herbs for Dreamwork and Opening Psychic Abilities at Catland, an occult bookshop in Brooklyn which gained minor notoriety in 2017 for organizing a ceremony to “hex” US president Donald Trump.In a black-walled room lit by a single bulb, 17 students sit before Rebecca Fey, an aerialist acrobat and tarot reader wearing skull-printed tights and feather earrings. She’s listing herbs with purported mystical benefits. Mugwort, she says, is great for opening your Third Eye wormwood helps induce visions cinnamon raises vibrational frequencies catnip attracts good spirits wild lettuce can be smoked – Hopi Indians used it to induce trance states.Students scribble notes as Fey explains how to rub herbs into a mirror to practice a form of ination called “scrying”.“Does it have to be so dark in here?” one student asks.“How do you spell ‘scry’?” asks another.In the US, skeptics about psychic phenomena outnumber believers, but not by much. Polls tend to show that around one-third to one-half of Americans believe in phenomena such as telepathy and precognition. These beliefs fuel a $2bn psychic services industry that has been growing steadily since the 2008 recession.When I ask which herbs are best for beginners, Fey says: “You seem like a mugwort person. Burn mugwort to hone your intuition. Stare into a candle flame. Ask what it wants you to know.”After class, students mill around the shop, sniffing bundles of juniper, inspecting ankh pendants and penis-shaped candles. I buy an ounce of mugwort for $3. One woman spends $93.73 on pre-packaged “spiritual bath herb mixes”.Later, I show a friend my new mugwort stash. “I don’t think you’d handle seeing the future very well,” she says. Still, when I get home I burn mugwort in a shot glass and stare into a candle flame, silently asking what it wants me to know. The candle doesn’t answer. The mugwort smells like crappy marijuana, but nothing happens when I inhale its smoke.This is disappointing, though Fey had fairly warned me: “What you’re gonna experience isn’t like on TV, where you touch someone and suddenly see their whole life story. Don’t think of it as, like, zero to 10.”The next morning, I go to my fact-checking job. Fact-checkers are supposed to ensure the accuracy of every grain of information in a given article. Under a president who makes an average of 6.5 false or misleading claims a day, the often tedious business of fact-checking has taken on new urgency.While fact-checking in February, I confirm that a pair of cat-shaped Gucci earrings costs $2,390 that an average of 31 American women die from opioids every day that 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school on Valentine’s Day and that the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart.At work, the tyranny of facts feels inescapable.“If it’s coming from spirit, then it’s true,” says Melissa Waite Stamps, a self-described clairvoyant medium who has Morticia Addams hair. “This world is totally nonlinear. It’s a different universe. It’s like being in a dream state.”At age 11, Melissa was inducted as a priestess by her Irish nanny into the Pagan “path of goddess mysteries” without the knowledge of her Upper East Side socialite mother. Now she runs a weekly psychic development Meetup group.On a Monday evening, in a cramped, windowless room near the Empire State Building, Melissa tells six students about how spirits might convey information to channelers: through dreams, goosebumps, flashing lights, radios randomly turning on and off.Then she guides the group on a meditative trip.“Journey now to non-ordinary reality,” Melissa lilts over a recording of singing bowls playing from an iPhone. “Allow your spirit guide to lead you to places where you find the missing parts of yourself. Crystal caves, star systems, universe below the ocean. Travel beyond time and human experience.”After five minutes, we describe our journeys to “non-ordinary reality”.A PR professional flew through the skies with her recently deceased pet monk parrot. A tired-looking nurse met a shepherd in Biblical Jerusalem who revealed her unlimited potential. A wellness blogger drank from a Thermos full of light. I swam in a grotto with Glinda the Good Witch.When each person speaks, the students say: Wow. Amazing. Beautiful.“I used to differentiate between imagination and reality, but now, it’s all real to me,” says Siréne, an artist from Tokyo. Siréne is “learning to speak dolphin”, because, in a past life, he was a “giant bipedal dolphinoid, with tiny little humans as pets”. He misses that life and, when he’s not painting pictures of winged muscle-gods, often returns to it during meditations.In her book Your Psychic Soul, Judith Pennington explains how you know if a past-life memory is true: “Deep inside, you will feel whether it is true or not. But in the end, it doesn’t really matter. What is real in the mind is what is real in your present life.”From this perspective, the question of what is objectively true becomes irrelevant fantasy and reality are interchangeable.Next, Melissa has us pair up to practice “aura reading”.“Using your clairvoyance, give your partner a message from spirit based on the colors you read in their aura,” Melissa tells the Meetup group.I sit across from the PR professional grieving her parrot. She gazes at me, takes deep breaths, and says she sees “a crown of green and white light, like the Statue of Liberty’s”, emanating from my head: “It’s very clear.”I stare back and see no colors surrounding the woman, save an orange glow from a lamp on her black hair. I wonder if she really sees a gleaming crown on my head. I find myself doubting it – I don’t feel any crown of light I have a headache – but, ultimately, I have no way of knowing what she sees or doesn’t see. Psychic lessons aren’t working on me, and I can’t telepathically inhabit her mind to discover if she’s telling the truth.When Melissa checks in with me and my partner, I tell her that if I were to claim I saw glowing colors, I’d feel guilty of making stuff up.“Everyone feels like they’re making it up at first,” Melissa tells me. “Make it up.”When I squeeze my eyes shut, greenish floaters appear.“I guess I’m getting a green vibe,” I tell my partner, “but maybe that’s because you’d look good in green.”“What do you think it means?” Melissa says.“Maybe it would help you to spend time in a green space,” I try. “Like a park?”“My bird was green,” my partner says.“There you go!” says Melissa.“I didn’t know parrots lived there,” my partner says.The notion that every human can develop supernatural abilities has captivated Americans for centuries. It wasn’t just the counterculture that was seduced: the government bought it, too.In recent years, belief in mediumship has gained prominence in pop culture. Oprah Winfrey, Dr Phil and the Real Housewives all feature mediums on their TV shows. Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s $250m lifestyle juggernaut, promotes mediums – as well as animal communicators and “Psychic Vampire Repellent” – on its heavily-trafficked website. At the brand’s recent In Goop Health conference, a medium claimed that “death does not exist”.In March, I attend Montclair Psychic School’s nine-hour Unfoldment Into Mediumship class. A course description claims that, by the end of this workshop, students “will have conducted spirit contact with proof of life”.When I arrive, Lee Van Zyl sits puffing on an e-cigarette before one man and five women, all middle-aged. Wearing sweatshirts and mom jeans, they look more like a focus group on suburban Costco shoppers than a circle of aspiring necromancers.“We are here to prove the soul survives,” Van Zyl says. A dark-haired ex-lawyer from Cape Town, she calls her students “darling” as she explains how, in order to channel spirits, “we must learn to quiet our analytical left-brain voice”.“I gave that nagging, critical voice a name,” Van Zyl says. “I call her Frankie.”Throughout class, Lee refers disparagingly to “Frankie Talk”, personifying the voice of rational thought, which, she explains, should be silenced whenever possible.“Frankie” interferes with trust in the “five clairs”, which are like supercharged versions of the five senses. The best known is clairvoyance, which makes symbols and images appear on a screen behind your forehead. There’s also clairaudience, clairsentience, clairalience and clairgustance.As an example of how clairgustance, the “gift of clear taste”, works, Van Zyl says: “You might be sitting with someone and taste bitter lemon. Why? Well, maybe the person likes lemon, but maybe they’re feeling bitter.”Next, Lee guides us through an exercise that’s like speed dating, but with ghosts.“Close your eyes and project yourself into the corner of the room,” she says. “There are spirit people over there. Go introduce yourself. Ask: ‘What was your life like? How did you die?’ Be friendly. Some might be shy.”I close my eyes and try to summon spirit people.“Hi, guys. How did you die?” I mentally whisper. No one responds.Lee suggests icebreakers: “Ask spirit people who are somehow connected to water to introduce themselves. Maybe you’ll meet a surfer, a fireman holding a hose, farmers watering their lands.”I wait for dead surfers and firemen and farmers to appear. Nothing happens.“Now spirit people are gonna tell you how they experienced illnesses,” Lee says. She suggests summoning spirits who died of emphysema, tuberculosis, heart attacks, Alzheimer’s or sugar diabetes. “‘Frankie Brain’ might say: ‘Oh, shit, I’m not getting anything.’ Make it happen.”I picture clusters of ghosts floating by the water cooler, showing me their ruptured aortas and emphysemic lungs.When we return to the mortal realm, Lee asks: “How’d that go?”One student expresses doubt that the spirit people she met were more than figments: “I don’t know – is it just in my mind, or is it really real?”Another student brags about her spirit world networking skills.“I met a skier named Bernie,” she says. “And a pale woman, in a white gown, who was ‘desperate for company’, and a poor little peasant boy.”“The thing about this work is you start to dislike living people,” she says. “It’s much more fun to talk to dead people.”After weeks spent googling terms like “animal telepathy”, targeted advertisements pop up in my Facebook feed soliciting me to participate in a research study about the early signs of psychosis.“BELIEVING OR HEARING THINGS THAT OTHERS DO NOT?” the ads ask. “LOSING CONTROL OF YOUR THOUGHTS?”In the mediumship class, students nod when Van Zyl describes how, as a shy, bullied teenager, she heard voices that others didn’t. “I thought I was schizo,” she says. “I saw the movie Sybil and thought: ‘Oh god, they’re gonna lock me up, because I’m worse than her.’”It wasn’t until she started attending séances with her father, also a medium, that she came to believe she was hearing spirit people.Eventually, these voices “just shut off”, and she became a lawyer. But after noticing that her two-year-old daughter “seemed to be talking to spirits” in 2006, Van Zyl quit her job and founded Montclair Psychic School.When she came out, in middle age, as gay, Lee’s family cut off contact with her. “My living family were no longer speaking to me,” she says, “but the dead were. I still felt like I had family who loved me, because the dead became living and the living became dead.”During my classes, I witness many total strangers cry and talk about loss. In the animal telepathy workshop, a nurse breaks down, saying: “I’m lonely. Everybody I’ve loved has been taken away. My father, my two children, my three dogs. Every time I see the light, it’s like, boom. Gone.”In Melissa’s aura reading class, a wellness blogger moves her hands around in the air like she’s miming washing windows, because, she explains, she’s been “going through a spiritual kundalini awakening” since her father died in 2017.In the mediumship class, a woman in a floral blouse weeps as Lee claims to be channeling the spirit of her son, who died of a drug overdose. “When I feel him all around me, is that him?” the woman asks. “Yes,” Lee says. “He’s saying: ‘You’re my best friend.’”Siréne, the artist from Tokyo, tells me that, for years, he was depressed and suicidal: “I felt like a sponge, absorbing everyone’s feelings, cursed with empathy.” Now in psychic school, where teachers often frame mental illnesses as signs of undeveloped mystical gifts, he feels “more at home”. He’s focusing on “psychopomp work” – the guiding of newly dead souls into the afterlife. After a close friend from childhood killed herself, he says he shepherded her spirit toward a portal in the sun: “You imagine they have wings. Tell them: ‘There’s a better place than here. Fly toward the sunlight.’”As homework for his yearlong psychic certification course at the Edgar Cayce Association for Research and Enlightenment, Siréne has to give 10 readings to strangers. I offer to be his guinea pig. We sit near a sculpture called Durga Killing the Buffalo Demon at the Rubin Museum of Art.Siréne closes his eyes. For three minutes, his eyelids twitch crazily, his mouth agape, like he’s possessed. Then he draws what he saw during his “REM trance”: a Scandinavian man he claims I’ll meet while hiking in France. With swishy blond hair, a tiny chin and a giant neck, the man in the sketch looks like a Disney cherub on steroids. We will have three children, Siréne says, and our family will be like “a harmonious dolphin pod”.Siréne’s yearlong course costs $2,700. I ask if he plans to charge money for his readings. He says no. “If I did, I’d feel like I should be paying the spirits. I don’t think these messages are coming from me. I’m like a telephone.”Stories of self-proclaimed psychics conning clients out of vast sums are legion. Recently, there was the Times Square fortune teller found guilty of grand larceny after bilking a recovering addict of $550,000, having promised to revive his lost love using a time machine and a golden bridge. But this industry rife with scammers attracts plenty of true believers, like Siréne, whose motives seem entirely immaterial.“We’re led to believe we’re just this physical body,” Siréne says. “Right now, I happen to be Asian with black hair. But in reality, we’re everything. We can be a dolphin, an extraterrestrial, a reptilian, an insect. I was a dwarf in the 17th century. The psychic thing lets you know the truth, not just the material self.”Skeptics often call mediums “grief vampires”. They argue that any comfort derived from paranormal belief is false, and comes at a grave cost. Some warn of the potential political ramifications of such belief.In an age of total epistemic confusion, the mainstreaming of parapsychology and related New Age practices seems to run parallel to other anti-scientific trends: climate change denial, the anti-vaxxer movement, conspiracy theories from PizzaGate to QAnon. A recent study found the espousal of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience and belief in the paranormal turn out to be highly correlated with one another.After six months, I drop out of psychic school. I don’t have the patience to stare into a candle flame for 15 minutes a day, and my mugwort stash has been sitting untouched in my underwear drawer for weeks. Since the animal telepathy class, I often try to read the mind of my roommate’s cat, but all I ever gather is that she wants food.Over the phone, I thank Melissa for her teachings.“I hope you find your way back to your goddess roots,” she says.I think I detect a note of pity or motherly concern in her voice, like she’s looking down from the astral plane, feeling sorry that I haven’t found my way back to my goddess roots. But I might just be projecting.I’m not sure. I can’t read her mind.Illustrations by Gabriel Alcala"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cbb16578a983e4d1cbcd02781c01481fe3dd756/1_0_4014_2409/master/4014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f4815462bc9b9601cadc4af94938d90","title":"seven ways to boost your gut health","story":"A few species of microbe play a crucial role in maintaining the microbiome. From eating wholegrains to breastfeeding, there are many ways to keep them happyScientists have identified a few species among the many trillions of microbes that live in your intestines that play a crucial role in gut health and maintaining a balanced immune system. Your dietary intake is vital to allowing these species to flourish and to preventing imbalances that can lead to disease. Prebiotics provide a good food source for certain populations of healthy gut bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, which, in turn, prevent intestinal inflammation. Studies have shown that prebiotics can be particularly beneficial for obese people, as they reduce insulin and cholesterol levels, while lowering the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Prebiotics can be bought as supplements, but they are also contained within foods including asparagus, leeks, bananas, garlic and jerusalem artichoke.Western diets tend to be rich in fat and sugar, with most of our food coming from only 12 plant and five animal species. However, following a diet rich in high-fibre foods such as apples, artichokes, blueberries, chickpeas, lentils, pease and beans can limit the growth of harmful bacteria and stimulate bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and another healthy species called Bacteroidetes.Fermented foods such as kimchi, kefir, kombucha, natural yoghurts and fermented soya bean milk have been shown to promote the abundance of healthy gut bacteria and reduce the levels of enterobacteriaceae, a family of bacteria linked to a number of chronic diseases. Natural yoghurt enriched with bifidobacteria has also been found to alleviate lactose intolerance in children and adults, while yoghurts enhanced with lactobacilli have had some beneficial results in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Avoid flavoured yoghurts, which tend to contain high levels of sugar.Polyphenols are plant compounds that are mainly digested by gut bacteria and are associated with a variety of benefits including reducing blood pressure, cholesterol and oxidative stress. They are found in foods including almonds, blueberries and broccoli as well as in green tea, cocoa and red wine. The types of polyphenols found in cocoa are linked to changes in the microbiome that reduce inflammation and triglyceride levels.Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame are commonly found in food as replacements for sugar. However, aspartame has been found to alter gut bacteria in human and animal studies. These changes appear to result in elevated blood sugar levels and increased susceptibility to metabolic disease.Our microbiome is continually developing during our first two years of life. A number of studies have shown that babies who are breastfed for six months develop a much healthier gut compared with those who are fed with formula. Children who have been breastfed are also less prone to allergies, obesity, leukemia and diabetes this is thought to be linked to the microbiome.Several studies have suggested that vegetarian diets may be good for the microbiome, with findings indicating that a largely plant-based diet decreases the levels of disease-causing bacteria such as E coli and Enterobacteriaceae. This may be particularly beneficial for obese people with type 2 diabetes or hypertension. One small study found that obese people who switched to a vegetarian diet had reduced levels of potentially harmful bacteria as well as lower levels of cholesterol and inflammation after one month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4d3b1fcc960f4751e627370f375c2ebdab63fad/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d38a5087d9e7c75d0ca1c788e7b6ef5f","title":"i think an estate agent has misled me can i recover my costs","story":"I wasn’t told about the poor state of the roof when I asked why previous sales had fallen through Q I’m in the process of purchasing a property and have had my offer accepted. I’ve also just had a building survey completed that has highlighted serious issues with the roof, which means that extensive work or replacement is required.The property has been on the market for more than a year with a number of failed sales. At the time of putting in my offer, I asked why the sales fell through and if there was any major remedial work that was required, the estate agent cited various reasons, but none were due to the building condition. That contradicts what my surveyor told me which was that he’d previously done a valuation on the same property whereby he’d given a much lower valuation because of the condition of the roof. Based on my surveyor’s comments I feel the estate agent has either lied or been misleading about the condition of the property and about the reasons for the failure of previous sales. So far I’ve paid out for the survey and various conveyancing costs. Do I have any recourse against the estate agent to recover my costs?GSA The estate agent you have been dealing with seems to have forgotten that under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 – also more snappily known as Consumer Protection Regulations (CPRs) – heshe must disclose any pertinent information about a property which might influence a prospective buyer’s decision. According to the Property Ombudsman “pertinent” information is information considered material to a consumer’s decision to enter into a transaction and it should be disclosed at the earliest opportunity. To put it another way, if a reasonable person would take a piece of information as a negative factor in the decision-making process, then it should be disclosed. Pertinent information includes, among a whole host of other things, the reasons why previous sales have fallen through and problems highlighted in previous surveys. Providing misleading information or failing to mention something that is relevant can result in criminal charges being taken against the seller or estate agent.If, as I suspect is the case, you would not have put in an offer or paid for a survey had you known about the condition of the roof, I would say that you have reasonable grounds for complaint. You might find it useful to use the “How to make a complaint” guidance – which includes sample letters – on the Property Ombudsman’s website. To start with you’ll need to make a written complaint to the estate agent detailing what the problem was and how you would like them to resolve your complaint – such as reimburse the costs you have incurred. If you get no joy from the estate agent, you can then take it to the ombudsman or the Property Redress Scheme.

The number of rented homes has more than doubled since 2000, to 4.8m, as the construction of private and social housing has slowed dramatically since the financial crisis and hundreds of thousands of new landlords have entered the market seeking better investment returns amid low interest rates.“It is scary for me to think we have a lot of families in these circumstances,” said Julie Rugg, a senior research fellow at the University of York’s Centre for Housing Policy who co-authored the report. “There is a disproportionately high percentage of households with babies and infants living in the private rented sector and there is a particular concern for the longer-term health consequences of living in damp, mouldy property with poor thermal comfort.”The problem conditions are not confined to young families. One in three homes at the lowest rents and one in five of the most expensive homes are classed as non-decent. In 201617, half of new households were private renters, twice the number who became owner–occupiers.The Centre for Housing Policy also warned of a new kind of “slum tenure” at the bottom of the rental market spreading as a result of welfare cuts and the introduction of universal credit causing landlords to cut back on maintenance and allowing properties to fall into squalor.The findings come amid growing pressure on the government to toughen regulation of private rentals, especially as more vulnerable people who would previously have been in social housing are relying on the sector.Campaign groups including Shelter, which has described private rent as like the “wild west”, want the government to start making public its database of convicted rogue landlords and to insist on minimum three-year tenancies to give tenants greater leverage to challenge poor conditions. A new fitness for human habitation bill will mean tenants can take landlords to court with evidence that their homes are unfit.“Declining home ownership and a shortage of social rented homes have led to a surge in the number of people privately renting, particularly families with young children,” said Rugg. “Unfortunately, in its current form the private rental market isn’t providing a suitable alternative. We need to see a fundamental rethink of the role that private renting plays in our housing market.”Labour accused ministers off failing to catch up with the growing importance of the rented sector. “Nearly 5 million households now rent their home from a private landlord, but you have fewer rights renting a flat than you do buying a fridge-freezer,” said John Healey, the shadow housing secretary.A government spokesman said: “Landlords should be in no doubt that they have a responsibility to provide decent homes or face the consequences. We have launched a national database of offenders to keep track of the small minority of landlords that are renting out unsafe and substandard accommodation and have introduced banning orders for the most serious offences. We’ve also introduced new measures to stop so-called retaliatory evictions and are banning unfair letting fees and capping tenancy deposits.”A decent home has to be free from hazards to health and safety, in reasonable repair, reasonably insulated and heated and have reasonable modern facilities.The Centre for Housing Policy is calling for properties to be subject to an annual MOT-style inspection by an independent assessor, paid for by the landlord, without which the property cannot be rented out. There is currently no regulation that defines a minimum standard for a letting, with enforcement only if they are inspected by the council.Landlords say existing rules are not enforced by councils so there is no point in passing new regulations. “We are calling on councils to provide the political leadership needed to use the extensive powers they have to find and root out the minority of landlords who are criminals and have no place in the market,” said David Smith, policy director at the Residential Landlords Association.The National Landlords Association said it was important that any MOT checks did not increase its members’ costs. Its chief executive, Richard Lambert, said: “When landlords cannot achieve an income from rents sufficient to cover the costs of running and maintaining their property, good landlords will exit the market, reducing the supply of decent homes to rent and criminal landlords will fill the gap.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3da6dcf1e1a75711e1fd2b1c09d13d8a2d70803f/0_0_5471_3282/master/5471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf5f836fb4a5adb034241031f265a904","title":"d double e grimes nearly man i havent been able to prove myself","story":"Skepta hailed him the ‘greatest grime MC of all time’ but Darren Dixon has struggled to break into the mainstream – can his solo debut album change that?“I’ve wasted too much time,” says D Double E, in an uncharacteristically sombre moment, between mouthfuls of sausage and mash in his local pub in east London. It’s 14 years since the self-professed Newham General – the MCs’ MC, the fans’ favourite – was first (and last) interviewed in the , and his impatience is understandable.Back then, in grime’s breakout period, when the genre was only just acquiring the name, there was a tumult of hype, expectation and raw talent drawing mainstream interest. Even at that early stage, D Double E was seen as something of a veteran – like Wiley, he was a vital few years older than teenage crews like Ruff Sqwad and Meridian, from which Tinchy Stryder and Skepta would emerge respectively. After leaving the legendary Nasty Crew, following a falling-out with Marcus Nasty, he was ready to graduate from a thriving if chaotic underground scene. “I’m not a little kid any more,” he said in that 2004 interview, “I wanna be an artist, man.” He has not stopped making music, or performing, in the intervening decade and a half – which makes it pretty extraordinary that D Double is only now releasing a debut album.Born Darren Dixon, his status on the grime scene is difficult to overstate. He is the one who inspired Dizzee Rascal, originally a DJ, to pick up the mic. In 2015 Skepta called him, without hesitating, “the greatest grime MC of all time”. Wiley recently recalled that “the root of all this grime business” was him and D Double performing at house parties in east London in the 90s. Chipmunk referenced D Double’s classic early material on his first single, Fire Alie (“back in the day I’d lock into danger, hear D Double spit birds in the Sky”). The 38-year-old MC personifies grime’s evolution as a genre born of pirate radio and rave culture – where the MC is a host in the Jamaican sound-system tradition, responding spontaneously to the DJ’s live selections, rather than a polished, managed artist laying down pre-written pop songs in a studio, playing the (white) industry game.In those early days, grime was not a visible genre, and to distinguish themselves from the clamour on a multi-MC pirate radio show, an idiosyncratic vocal style, memorable ad-libs and a verbal audio-logo were invaluable parts of the MCs’ armoury. On these terms, D Double’s charisma soon made him a pirate legend. The “D Double signal” was an immediately recognisable announcement of his arrival at a rave or on a radio set, like a music-hall performer peering his head around the side of the curtain, before stepping out on to the stage. Written non-phonetically, in standard English, it looks comical – “Ooh, ooh! It’s me, me!” – but it’s spread out over about nine or 10 syllables, a visceral vocal exorcism from somewhere deep in the lungs. (“That’s very original: never heard that from another inidual,” runs an old school D Double lyric, commentatingon his own style.)D Double grew up in Forest Gate in the 80s and 90s, surrounded by reggae and American hip-hop. He would write out Snoop Dogg lyrics while simultaneously falling in love with pop music: classics by the likes of Neneh Cherry and Dawn Penn – he sings the latter’s No, No, No to me, screwing up his face in mock-emotional tribute. He clearly loves making people laugh, an entertainer whether the mic is in his hand or not: doing silly voices, impersonating a subwoofer, and doing theatrical renditions of everything from jungle MCs to CeCe Peniston. He gets that gregarious “dapper Dan” style from his father, he says: “You look at photos of him from back in the day, it’s like Eddie Murphy in Raw: full leathers, V-neck with the hairy chest – when my dad walks down the road, everyone knows him, you know?”There was a lot of togetherness in the early grime scene, he recalls – they’d travel from Newham to Bow to meet Wiley, or to south London or Hackney for raves and pirate radio sets. “It felt more like a community, it felt a bit closer,” he says. “We had to work our way out of certain conditions – it used to be quite racist back in the day in east London.” That spirit was forged by “guys linking to make music in bedrooms and youth centres, and most of all in radio stations. That gave us the platform, it helped so much.” After a decade in which grime has come to dominate pop culture, and where the illegal stations have been largely replaced by the likes of BBC Radio 1Xtra and Rinse FM, the pirate era seems like a lost world.“The stations felt like traps man,” he laughs. “Some of them never had proper doors, they were just abandoned houses, you could just push the door open and walk in, and so then when you’re on air spitting, you’re looking around thinking, ‘Who’s going to come in?’ Or sometimes it would be in a normal household, so you walk in, see the kids playing, mum’s cooking dinner, you say hello to the uncles and then you go upstairs to the bedroom, and it’s a radio station! It wasn’t always about recording what you were doing, sometimes it was just that your mate’s got some decks in his bedroom, so let’s all have a mix.”Those teenage experiments are where his hilarious ad-libs come from: the D Double signal, but also other catchphrases like “bi-di-bup-bup” or “bluku bluku”, lyrical idiosyncrasies traceable back to both his and grime’s origins in jungle and drum’n’bass in the 90s. “Those echoes come from spraying in that freestyle way – that spur-of-the-moment energy, that’s where the magic is. We had to create grime, because we needed it for our spirits, as spitters – because we’re coming from drum’n’bass, which is so open, like, ‘Spray your heart out G, spray your lungs out!’”After Dizzee was signed and won the Mercury prize, he wanted to bring through his teenage hero, and approached D Double about joining his new label, Dirtee Stank. D Double agreed, on the condition he signed his new crew, Newham Generals, which he had formed with fellow local MCs’ Footsie and Monkstar. Touring as Dizzee’s support act in front of new audiences unfamiliar with their pirate fame was a learning curve, he says. “It was an eye opener, it was the first time I got to see what living the real life would be, outside of the clubs, sweating in the small raves. It put us in a spot where we had to learn how to entertain differently.” In the best part of a decade signed to Dirtee Stank, the crew only released one album, Generally Speaking, in 2009, and a smattering of classic solo singles, like D Double’s Streetfighter Riddim – there was a sense among fans of constant postponements, and that the releases weren’t capturing the brilliance of the MCs’ live performances.“That whole period was just frustrating,” he says now, adding that there is another Newham Generals album “in the tank”, which will see a release at some point. “I had too many people telling me different things. But I think it had to happen – and the freedom I have now, with my independent label, Bluku Music: I run the label myself, and I handle the artists myself. It’s all coming from the right organic corners … and I’m in control of what’s happening. It’s like grabbing a hold of the horses yourself. I’ve always just been sitting there, waiting for somebody to tell me when, but I want to tell myself when. I don’t want anyone telling me what to do, that’s the way forward.”His debut solo album, Jackuum!, features guest spots from fellow grime originals Wiley, Skepta and younger MCs AJ Tracey and Littlez, but the sound is distinctively D Double – the skippy flow and cheeky persona shines through. He’s so taken with his newfound independence, he’s already making his next one. It feels like an overdue epiphany, and an opportunity to take two decades of free-flowing lyrical brilliance and spontaneity, and canalise it into something widely accessible, and lasting. Most of all, he seems happy.“I’ve won people over with entertainment, but I haven’t been able to prove myself. People say ‘D Double’s the best, he’s the best!’, but what is there to prove that? There isn’t even an album, there’s just verses and bars. I want to give the people my music – they don’t want those 16 bars no more, they want a product. I’m doing what I should have been doing years ago: being a free spirit.”• Jackuum! is out now on Bluku Music.

How do we define the different types of migrant, how many are there and is the current crisis really an unprecedented problem?These are loaded words because they often suggest a backstory or motive that may be inaccurate.According to the 1951 United Nations refugee convention, the difference between refugees and asylum seekers is clear. An asylum seeker has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution. A refugee has already received such protection.Refugees have the right to international protection while seeking asylum is a human right, which means everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek asylum. Internally displaced people (IDPs) are essentially on the run in their own country: putative refugees who have not been able or willing to cross an international border.When it comes to migrants, definitions are far woollier. Some presume a migrant is on the move to seek a better life. But if that person is leaving the penury and starvation of a dustbowl farm in the Sahel in order to survive,, are they a migrant or a refugee?The International Organization for Migration (IOM) therefore defines a migrant as any person who is moving or has moved across an international border or within a state regardless of legal status, whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary, what the causes for the movement are, and what the length of the stay is.Expatriate is a weakly defined term that essentially means anyone living outside their native country. In practice, expat has come to mean a migrant from a rich country.We are now witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. About 258 million people, or one in every 30, were living outside their country of birth in 2017.That is both a record high – there were 173 million in 2000 – and an alarmingly volatile figure: a 2003 projection anticipated that by 2050, there would be up to 230 million international migrants. The latest revised projection is that there will be 405 million international migrants by 2050.Even those figures, however, fail to capture the full reality. There were 25.9 million refugees and asylum seekers in mid-2017. But registered refugees represent only a fraction of all those forced to leave their homes for reasons ning from war to environmental crisis. In total, at least 66 million people globally are experiencing forced displacement – approximately 40.3 million of whom are IDPs.As for expats, estimates vary wildly, depending on definition. The state department reckons 9 million Americans live overseas. About 5 million Britons are thought to do so.Finally, there are 10 million people who are stateless, with no citizenship at all.According to the IOM, the US, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the UK were the top five destinations for migrants in 2015. The US has about 46 million foreign-born residents, Germany about 12 million.India, Mexico, Russia, China and Bangladesh were the top five origin countries. Nearly half of all international migrants came from Asia, although it is still far more common for Asians and Africans to move within their own continent than to settle further afield.Later in 2017, however, the new president, Donald Trump, slashed the cap to 45,000. According to the International Rescue Committee, the US will only resettle 21,292 refugees in the current fiscal year.By contrast, some of the world’s poorer and often less stable countries – such as Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan and Uganda – are now the long-term hosts to the world’s largest populations of refugees.Turkey is currently the leading host of refugees, with 3.5 million, followed by Uganda and Pakistan, which both host about 1.4 million, according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.But many refugees slip through the gaps when attempts at record-keeping take place. For example, official figures usually exclude Palestinian refugees because they don’t fall into the specific mandate of UN refugees. A separate agreement was reached on their behalf when the 1951 refugee convention was drawn up, specifically to try to avoid what has nevertheless come to pass: a permanent acceptance of their displacement. The number of Palestinian refugees varies depending on the source but there are reckoned to be between 5.3 million and 6.5 million – around one in three of all refugees worldwide. The US last month announced it was cutting all funding to the main Palestinian refugee programme.Not only are the numbers of refugees and migrants underestimated but so too is the chronic length of time refugees remain displaced in camps and so-called “temporary” situations.There are still Palestinian refugees forced from their country in 1948 living in camps in Syria, Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees who have been living in camps in Sudan since the mid-1960s, Afghan refugees who have been in camps in Pakistan since the Soviet invasion in 1979. The list goes on.Moreover, many of the countries from which large numbers of people are forced to flee conflict – such as Syria, South Sudan, Iraq and Yemen – are also host to very large internally displaced populations.“But that scale of movement doesn’t match the move from South Sudan to Uganda less than a year later and doesn’t far exceed what has even more recently happened across MyanmarBangladesh border, or in Venezuela where large numbers of people are moving to Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and other countries in that region.”Migration is arguably politically less acceptable than at any point since the end of the second world war. The anti-immigration response of governments across Europe, and in American and Australia has sent quite clear signs to some of those frontline countries that they can build walls and force back those seeking safe havens.“The last few years have seen quite threatening movements by countries that had offered refugees a relative degree of safety,” said Valdez-Symonds. “Of Kenya towards its refugee Somali populations, for example, and of Pakistan towards its Afghan refugees.”There is an additional complication involving those fleeing environmental disasters, such as flooding or desertification. The 1951 convention doesn’t define these people as refugees but, as Bill Frelick, Human Rights Watch’s refugee rights programme director, says: “If someone’s life is in danger, it really shouldn’t matter if it’s because of a gun or a landslide or earthquake.”Are any countries holding their heads up in this maelstrom? Sadly, experts say not. “I don’t know that anyone has it right,” said Valdez-Symonds. “Canada has a very large and, in many ways, a very good resettlement programme for refugees. But for those who seek asylum across Canada’s borders, its response to those people is not all that good: it has major issues of long-term use of detention centres for those crossing its borders.”Frelick said: “I don’t know of any country I can point to and say: ‘This place has got it right.’ You can say some aspects are far better than other places. The UK can probably still hold itself up as a comparatively better place for resettlement than many others. But our response to asylum seekers is not especially healthy and our response has generally deteriorated over time.”Political and public hostility to migration has resulted in a dramatic reduction in legal routes to migration in the past 20 years. This has encouraged a burgeoning business in illegal people trafficking, now reckoned to be worth more than $150bn each year.Principal areas of activity are from south to north in the Americas (there are an estimated 3m illegal entries into the US each year, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime) from Africa and the Middle East into Europe and from south Asia west to the Gulf and Europe beyond.Death is common. According to the IOM’s missing migrants project, almost 30,000 people have died in transit over the past five years, with the Mediterranean, north Africa and central America particularly deadly. The UN is to formally agree a new global compact on migration in Marrakech this December, following 18 months of negotiations. Protagonists say the deal promises a better, more coordinated approach to migration, though efforts have been damaged by the US pulling out of the talks halfway through.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid (fiction)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e09259a75553278b3385ed013f260a3bbafcd6c/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9da132bcbbaefbb56ea0d9cea39e4882","title":"brexit tory conservative mps chequers deal theresa may","story":"Steve Baker warns of ‘catastrophic split’ if May’s proposals are carried forwardThe Conservatives face a “catastrophic split” if Theresa May relies on Labour votes to push her Chequers plan through parliament, one of the prime minister’s most persistent critics has warned, as the conflict within the party over Brexit intensified.After a weekend dominated by coverage of Boris Johnson’s views on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, and his tangled personal life, the former junior Brexit minister Steve Baker used an interview to mark 200 days before departure to argue May must take a different approach.Baker, who quit in July over Chequers, said at least 80 Conservative MPs would be willing to vote against the plan, which Eurosceptics argue ties the UK too closely to the EU on regulation and alignment, hampering future bilateral trade deals.The issue is expected to dominate the Conservatives’ annual conference at the end of the month, with MPs from the hard-Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG), which Baker formerly chaired, hoping to sink the Chequers proposal.“If we come out of conference with her hoping to get Chequers through on the back of Labour votes, I think the EU negotiators would probably understand that if that were done, the Tory party would suffer the catastrophic split which thus far we have managed to avoid,” Baker told the Press Association.“We are reaching the point now where it is extremely difficult to see how we can rescue the Conservative party from a catastrophic split if the Chequers proposals are carried forward.“It is absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to me to acknowledge that, but I look at the mood of colleagues and the mood of the Conservative party in the country and I am gravely concerned for the future of our party.”While it is widely acknowledged that Johnson, who also wants May to abandon the Chequers plans, is seeking to position himself as the next prime minister, Baker said he was not advocating a change in leadership. “Time is running awfully short for anyone who thinks a leadership contest and a general election is a good idea,” the Wycombe MP said.The justice secretary, David Gauke, disputed Baker’s assessment. Asked by Sky News if Baker’s view was accurate, he said: “No, I don’t think it is.”Gauke castigated Baker and fellow Eurosceptics for not having a coherent plan of their own: “This is a process that is going to require compromises from all sides. And I think it is really important that we go forward with the Chequers proposal. Frankly, there isn’t an alternative that has been put on the table by the critics of Chequers. We haven’t had an alternative set out.”Gauke was similarly critical of Johnson after a furore over an article by the former foreign secretary on Sunday, in which he argued May’s Brexit plans amounted to “a suicide vest around the British constitution”.“I don’t think his comments yesterday were well judged,” Gauke said. “And, returning to the substance, I don’t think he’s set out an alternative approach to Brexit, in contrast to the Chequers plan. This is a time where we have to seriously address the issues in front of us, have a serious plan to deal with the situation. The prime minister is a serious politician who has set out serious plans.”Asked later by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme as to whether he could serve under Johnson, Gauke said there was no vacancy, adding: “I’m probably not a natural Boris supporter.”The former education secretary Nicky Morgan likened the “suicide vest” comment to a previous Johnson article in which he likened Muslim women wearing the niqab to “letterboxes”. Both were “deliberately incendiary language which just masks the ability to debate the issues”, she said.Morgan added: “Boris has to make a decision – I think he’s sort of made it. He’s either a journalist or a he’s a politician. He knew exactly what he was doing when he was using that language.”Baker and his ERG allies are seeking a so-called Canada-plus deal, which would be based around free trade, but with notably more limited alignment to EU rules.The ERG has been drawing up its alternative Brexit plan based on this. A draft leaked over the weekend showed it also called for significant tax cuts, something strongly argued for by Johnson in his weekly column for the Daily  on Monday.Baker said the ERG had decided to hold back on publication of its detailed plan in order to focus on a plan to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit, which he said was the “key to the gate” to a satisfactory agreement.Another ERG member, the Tory MP Simon Clarke, told Today he believed this was possible, adding: “The Northern Irish border issue is one that has been greatly exaggerated and abused. I think, for Irish domestic political reasons and by the EU itself. I think there are good reasons to believe that if you want to solve the problem then you can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94aded2d8d7e9f2b1f540f0e374a73120712b565/382_0_7874_4727/master/7874.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec07fcf362367bbae4c39fb61c57efbb","title":"can you solve it the dating game","story":"Find your perfect matchToday’s puzzle is about dating strategy.You’re single and looking for love.

They’re history. You select one of the two remaining doors. It opens to reveal someone else. Again, you can choose this person as your match. But just like before, if you choose this person, you don’t get to see who is behind the final door. Nor are you allowed to return to the person you discarded behind the first door.If you decide to move on a second time, you select the final door. You must choose the person behind it as your match, whatever you think of them. Also risky!To summarise: you only have one chance to decide on each person. If you decide to reject someone, you can’t return to them after. If you choose the first, you don’t get to see any of the others. If you want to see them all, you must choose the last.What strategy gives you the best chance of finding your best match? Can you improve your odds from 1 in 3?(Further clarification: You must assume that you know nothing about the average attractiveness of the group that the suitors are selected from. If you see the most attractive person you have ever seen behind the first door, there is still a 50 per cent chance that the person behind the second door is even more attractive. The question is not psychological or sociological: you can’t settle with the first one you think is acceptable. The puzzle is mathematical: it asks you to maximise your chance of getting the best possible match of those three on offer.)I like this puzzle because even though it is a massive simplification of modern dating, the underlying idea is relevant to many situations in real life. If you get to see many things (not just suitors) in sequence, and choosing one means you don’t get to see what comes after, nor are you allowed to return anything earlier in the sequence, when is it in your best interests to commit?I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solution, and a discussion of the well-studied mathematical problem on which the puzzle is based.I’m the author of several books of popular maths, including the puzzle books Can You Solve My Problems? and Puzzle Ninja.I also co-write Football School, the children’s book series that explains the world through football.

It took him three and a quarter hours to add a third title to the trophies he lifted here in 2011 and 2015, as well as a second major of the year to go with his return to championship form at Wimbledon, capped off with a rise to No 4 in the world.Players trying to emulate their idols got off to an emotional start in the final weekend of the 50th edition of the closing 2o18 major, so Djokovic matching the 14 major titles of Pete Sampras – always his favourite player – rounded out a baggage-free double easy to celebrate, after Naomi Osaka’s emphatic but turbulent win over Serena Williams 24 hours earlier.However, he had to come through two stirring Del Potro fightbacks to win 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3, as the Argentinian emerged from his early torpor to stretch Djokovic’s talent and patience to the limit.The second set, which could have gone either way, took 95 minutes, longer than any in the tournament, and featured a 20-minute street fight in the seventh game – about half the length of the first set. The third was no cakewalk either.In the early exchanges they prodded at each other’s defences like a pair of cagey old pugilists, until Djokovic held to love in the pivotal seventh game. When he got to break point with a string of blistering, angled forehands that sapped the oxygen-greedy legs of his 6ft 6in opponent, he cashed in.Del Potro had gone in with the humble mien of someone who takes nothing for granted but he needed to find his inner mongrel to keep the set alive, but dumped a backhand at the end of a long rally. He was having to fight harder than Djokovic, whose balance, poise and timing hit a high point towards the end of the first hour.Del Potro responded by striking the equal fastest serve of the tournament – 143 miles an hour, alongside Milos Raonic – in the third game. But a framed forehand from behind the line handed Djokovic the break.Del Potro has come back from many perilous situations in his career but not against this man. Djokovic had beaten him 14 times in 18 encounters and won all four of their matches in majors. The last time they met here, in the quarter-finals in 2012, Djokovic won in three sets.Memories of Del Potro’s 2009 triumph in New York, when he beat Rafael Nadal on the way to conquering Roger Federer at the height of his magnificence in the final, were distant – but his pride and fighting heart, forged in his struggle against wrist injuries that almost made him quit the sport in 2015, were as strong, maybe stronger.They reflected the enthusiasm of the noisy Tandil friends he had flown in for the fortnight, and their boisterous support riled Djokovic to the point of crack-up in the sixth game, which he surrendered with a wild forehand.Britain’s Alison Hughes – only the second female umpire to chair a men’s final here, after Eva Asderaki-Moore, who controlled Djokovic’s win over Roger Federer in 2015 – appealed for calm, of which this tournament has not seen a lot the past couple of days. She got some, but not a lot.As emotions continued to run high in the stands, so did the intensity build on court. What had looked like a formality for Djokovic had turned into one of his toughest challenges. It had taken Del Potro nearly an hour and a half to marry his strength to some rhythm and Djokovic, behind for the first time, momentarily dipped under the pressure.When Del Potro found the line with an exquisite backhand for break point, the 23,000 present rose as one. As Jimmy Connors remarked: “This is great tennis. Both players are at the top of their game at the same time.” Hughes seemed to ignore the shot-clock zero on Djokovic’s serve on game point but it mattered not, as he held through deuce eight times in 20 minutes, saving three break points and serving his first double fault to level at four-all. No picnic, this – and reminiscent of the 22-minute tiebreak he lost to go out of the French Open this summer.While protesters were ejected for unfurling banners aimed at the tournament sponsor, Chase, for investing in fossil fuels, on court it was business as usual. Djokovic, embroiled now in a fight he must have thought he had won an hour earlier, forced a tiebreak just past two hours. The only time Djokovic has lost from two sets up was eight years ago when Jürgen Melzer beat him in the quarter-finals of the French Open. Including Davis Cup, his run of five-set wins is an extraordinary 201.Sentiment and momentum were with the Tower of Tandil here but Djokovic won the tiebreak then, after an exchange of breaks – including a time violation on break point in the fifth game – he closed out the final set. He broke to serve for the title at 5-3, got to 30-all, drove majestically into the ad corner for match point, then smashed the winner and embraced one of his best friends in the game.Del Potro added: “It’s not easy to speak right now, but I am so happy to play in the final against this magnificent player. I’m sad to lose but happy for Novak. I never gave up during my wrist problems. I got back after nine years, which is amazing.”It was a final to stand comparison with any of recent times, certainly the best of the four 2018 majors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f5c67a1a2ba025a64360ba3d914b1b7d238e73c/0_248_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01364e8e1fb81ba8bb5868707c4cf427","title":"nfl stadium food 2018","story":"With the National Football League season kicking off this week, here’s a sampling of what the fans will be eating in the stands"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2973941d3f1e5a0e0cb49a44c1375824ae458619/1132_883_4270_2562/master/4270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9ae4a704b8ea7500aab9f36953199f7","title":"england v india fifth test day four live","story":"Morning!

It will be his first major address since joining Donald’s Trump White House.“The United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court,” Bolton will say, according to a draft of his speech.He will also say that the state department will announce the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) office in Washington out of concern about Palestinian attempts to prompt an ICC investigation of Israel.The PLO office in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“The United States will always stand with our friend and ally, Israel,” Bolton’s draft text states. It says the Trump administration “will fight back” if the international criminal court, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands, formally proceeds with opening an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by US service members and intelligence professionals during the war in Afghanistan.If such an inquiry proceeds, the Trump administration will consider banning judges and prosecutors from entering the US, put sanctions on any funds they have in the US financial system and prosecute them in the American court system.“We will not cooperate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die on its own.

The US did not ratify the Rome treaty that established the court in 2002, with then-President George W Bush opposed to the court.

But at least one person is definitely excited – the writer of a breathless press release accompanying the launch.“The space will feature a lounge area, a game room and a full-service dining room, but by far the most attractive feature of Playboy Club New York will undoubtedly be the return of the Playboy Bunnies to Manhattan,” the release said.“The alluring Playboy Bunny hostesses, waitresses and cocktail servers have a worldwide, well-deserved reputation for their style and graciousness.”The Playboy Club will be located on the west side of Manhattan, about a mile-and-a-half south-west of the original club, and just a few blocks from where hundreds of thousands of people took part in a Women’s March in January.That jarring symbolism is not lost on critics of the Playboy Club. Clark Wolf, a restaurant and food business consultant based in New York and California, described the decision to reopen the club as “completely tone deaf” given the push for greater gender equality.“It’s kind of ridiculous actually,” Wolf said. “People are demanding better conditions and a bunny suit and ears doesn’t seem to be on par with what people are wanting.”Wolf believes that the Playboy Club may be a “conscious or unconscious” tap into the pushback against women who are demanding equal rights.“There is a bitter fight going on right now for middle-aged douchey white men to regain power and control and that is going on at all levels of society,” Wolf said.The first Playboy Club opened in Chicago in 1960, and a slew of others followed in cities around the US. Miami, Dallas, Denver and San Diego all boasted their own clubs, and New York City got its version in 1962.Initially the clubs, where access was granted only with the presentation of a black and gold Playboy key, were a success, even if questions persisted about the working conditions Playboy Bunnies faced.The bunny outfits, Steinem wrote, were “two inches smaller than any of my measurements everywhere except the bust,” and “so tight that the zipper caught my skin”. Bunnies were expected to pad the bust of their costumes, while Steinem wrote that the pay was low, the hours long and the men lascivious.It remains to be seen how popular the club will be with New York City dwellers – especially given the failure of the initial clubs. Playboy claimed that it once had 750,000 members across its 30 clubs, but business and interest dried up in the mid-1970s, and by 1986 every club had shut down.The New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago clubs were the last of the company-owned clubs – some were franchised – to close, in 1986. It was thought – even by Hefner – that the era of the Playboy club had passed.The Playboy Bunny had become “a symbol of the past”, Hefner told the New York Times in 1986.“I’m not having any sleepless nights,” he said of the Playboy Clubs’ collective failure. “If anything, it’s a little overdue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4570185b968b4d154f8612d5ad71c225e3e21636/161_231_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=126c3b4188b49fffbc9e5d05bf8ae528","title":"swedish election far right on course for sizeable gains in vote","story":"Far-right Sweden Democrats set for significant role in policymaking as political uncertainty loomsSweden faces a protracted period of political uncertainty after an election that left the two main parliamentary blocs tied but well short of a majority, and the far-right Sweden Democrats promising to wield “real influence” in parliament despite making more modest gains than many had predicted.But the new government, which could now take weeks to form, will need either cross-bloc alliances between centre-right and centre-left parties, or an accommodation with the Sweden Democrats – long shunned by all other parties because of their extremist roots – to pass legislation, potentially giving the populists a say in policy.Many observers therefore see the Moderate party leader, Ulf Kristersson – who on Sunday night called for Löfven to resign – seeking to form a minority centre-right administration, possibly in coalition with the Christian Democrats and with implicit, ad hoc parliamentary support from the Sweden Democrats.This would give the populist party the opportunity to influence policy, particularly on immigration, in exchange for votes.Löfven said he would not be resigning, and urged cross-bloc cooperation: “The Sweden Democrats can never, and will never, offer anything that will help society. They will only increase ision and hate.” The mainstream parties now had a “moral responsibility” to form a government, he said.Addressing supporters on Sunday night, the Sweden Democrats’ leader, Jimmie Åkesson, said the 63 seats it would have in the 349-seat Riksdag represented victory. “No one can take that away from us.”He said he was interested in cooperating with the other parties, and wanted to tell the Moderates in particular “how to govern the country … We strengthen our kingmaker role. We will have an immense influence over what happens in Sweden in the coming weeks, months, years.”Both the smaller Liberal and Centre parties in the Moderates’ current centre-right alliance are fiercely opposed to any normalisation of relations with the populists, as are all the parties on the left.The election was Sweden’s first since the government allowed 163,000 migrants into the country – the most per capita of any European nation – during Europe’s 2015 migration crisis, polarising the nation’s 7.3 million voters and magnifying popular concern about a welfare system many felt was already under strain.Long waits for operations, shortages of doctors and teachers and a police force that has had difficulties dealing with a spate of gangland shootings and grenade attacks – often in deprived areas with high concentrations of immigrants – have all shaken faith in Sweden’s prized model of generous welfare and inclusiveness.The often antagonistic campaign was largely dominated by themes of immigration, integration and welfare, with the Sweden Democrats repeatedly presenting the vote as a straight choice between immigration and welfare spending.“This government we have had ... have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,” Jimmie Åkesson, the far-right party’s leader, told his final election rally this weekend. “Sweden needs breathing space. We need tight responsible immigration policies.”Casting his ballot in Stockholm on Sunday, Löfven, whose government radically tightened immigration laws in 2015, also described the vote as “a referendum about our welfare”. But, he said: “It is also about decency, about a decent democracy ... and about not letting the Sweden Democrats, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government.”Far-right parties have made significant gains at the expense of the political mainstream across western Europe in recent years in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2015 refugee crisis, and are now in government in Italy, Austria, Norway and Finland.“Traditional parties have failed to respond to the sense of discontent that exists,” said Magnus Blomgren of Umea University. “That discontent maybe isn’t directly related to unemployment or the economy, but simply a loss of faith in the political system. Sweden isn’t alone in this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908899d11bb3caaf53f2ef8614bbf4f8b469db07/0_499_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f528f49985e495553e752b8e32623e0","title":"its not about what is fair macedonians prepare to vote on name change","story":"Many Macedonians grudgingly accept need for name change in order to join Nato and EU North. It’s just a single five-letter word, but in Macedonia in recent weeks it has prompted many column inches of debate, hours of coffee-shop discussions and pages of online abuse.A referendum at the end of the month will ask citizens whether they are willing to add the word to the country’s official name, making it the Republic of North Macedonia.The change is the main part of an agreement between Macedonia and Greece signed by their respective prime ministers in June. Greece has long blocked Macedonian accession to Nato and the European Union, claiming its northern neighbour’s name is an unfair appropriation from the northern Greek region of Macedonia.For many inside Macedonia, changing the name is a delicate issue. “It’s not just about one word. Think about Northern Ireland and Ireland. Words have meaning,” said Sasho Klekovski, a pollster and analyst who opposes the deal.Nikola Dimitrov, Macedonia’s foreign minister, who spent months in negotiations with his Greek counterpart hammering out details of the deal, said it would offer a new path forward for the small nation of around 2 million people, which has struggled since it became independent after the collapse of Yugoslavia.“We have lost a generation. I am 45, I was 18 when Macedonia became independent. In a way this is the second chance for our generation to make it,” he said in an interview at his office in central Skopje, Macedonia’s capital.On 30 September the population will be asked: “Are you in favour of Nato and EU membership, and accepting the name agreement between the republic of Macedonia and Greece?”Government critics say the wording is manipulative, but the defence minister, Radmila Šekerinska, said it was quite proper to phrase the question in two parts. “If there was a chance to get into the EU and Nato without the agreement with Greece, everyone would be thrilled,” she said. “To deny the connection between the EU and Nato and the agreement is to be irrational.”Few Macedonians are positive about the name change, but many speak of it with the grudging acceptance that might be accorded an unpleasant but necessary medical procedure.“We are an isolated, small and poor country, so let’s do it. It’s not fair, but it’s not about what is fair but about what is good for everyone. If there’s a chance for people to live better, let’s take it,” said Sanja Arsovska, 31, an actor at the Skopje drama theatre.The deal has been stridently opposed by nationalists on both sides of the border – on Saturday Greeks protesters clashed with riot police – but polls suggest a slim majority are in favour of the deal, boosted by overwhelming support among Macedonia’s sizeable ethnic Albanian minority.The longstanding dispute between Skopje and Athens has been complicated in recent years by a “antiquisation” project carried out by the nationalist government of the previous prime minister Nikola Gruevski, in which dozens of statues, fountains and grand buildings adorned with faux-marble columns were erected in Skopje.The centrepiece is a fountain complex in the main square, topped with a statue of Alexander the Great on horseback. The monuments incensed Greece, who accused Skopje of appropriating Hellenic cultural and historical heritage.Gruevski was ousted from office in 2016 after a wire-tapping scandal and is now on trial for an array of offences. The new government reached the deal with Greece but will need the support of parts of Gruevski’s VMRO-DPMNE party to see it through, as the referendum is only consultative.VMRO officials are furious that Macedonia will have to change its name not only in international communications but internally as well, with passports, ministry names and all other references to Macedonia to be replaced by North Macedonia.“They would have had a better agreement if they had let the Greeks write it themselves, because probably the Greeks would have been a bit embarrassed to give themselves absolutely everything,” said Aleksandar Nikoloski, the deputy head of VMRO, in an interview at the party headquarters, an imposing building filled with lurid artworks that reflect Gruevski’s grandiose visions.VMRO are under intense international pressure not to scupper the agreement and have yet to announce whether or not they will call for a boycott of the referendum. Nikoloski has denied government claims that the party offered to support the deal in exchange for an amnesty for Gruevski and others.As well as trying to get the opposition onside, Macedonian officials are keeping an eye on Moscow during the campaign. Russia has openly said it opposes Macedonia’s Nato accession and has been accused of working behind the scenes to try to scupper the deal. Greece recently expelled Russian diplomats, accusing them of offering bribes to opponents of the deal.In Macedonia, the main pro-Russia force is Janko Bachev, a fringe politician whose United Macedonia party has sprung up in recent months. Bachev, speaking from the party offices where a Russian flag flies from the balcony, claimed the polls showing a majority of Macedonians in favour of Nato membership were “funded by the CIA” and insisted most Macedonians opposed the deal.“All the main parties here support liberal values such as homosexuality, gay marriage, changing Macedonia’s name and erasing everything that is Macedonian,” he said, adding that the Kremlin instead supported “traditional values” that aligned with the views of most Macedonians. He denied receiving funding from Russia but said he wanted Macedonia to enter into a strategic alliance with the Kremlin.Bachev, who is calling for a boycott of the vote, is not seen as a serious political force by most observers, but western diplomats are nevertheless following Moscow’s moves warily.“For years, Russia never said anything about Macedonia suddenly they are coming out with all kinds of statements,” said one. “I don’t think they are going to launch a Montenegro-style coup here, but could they put a few guys into a crowd and create a disturbance? I wouldn’t rule that out.”Western countries are pushing strongly for the deal to be a success, with Germany’s Angela Merkel visiting Skopje this weekend.If the deal is pushed through, Skopje and Athens have agreed to disagree on who or what constitutes a Macedonian: a sub-clause of the agreement says “the parties acknowledge that their respective understanding of the terms ‘Macedonia’ and ‘Macedonian’ refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage”.When it comes to the Skopje monuments of Alexander the Great and other classical heroes, the government has agreed that within six months it will take “corrective action” by renaming monuments that “refer in any way to ancient Hellenic history and civilisation”.Dimitrov said: “In the past we sacrificed our reality for mythology. Now we are sacrificing mythology for reality, and reality is what really matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a13e88bbf5d9cc488cfa70b746b7f0d5d63f70/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76867350dbf6c12488298ea3383c3b2a","title":"i want to be a doctor not a rabbi how israeli ultra orthodox are being drawn into work","story":"Traditionally, Haredi men have not joined the labour force. That is starting to changeFrom the age of three, Yehuda Sabiner harboured a secret ambition to become a doctor. But it seemed unlikely to be fulfilled: he was raised in one of the strictest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel.His education was limited to religious study, first at a private school that barely taught mainstream subjects and later at a yeshiva, a religious school, where he spent 14 hours a day studying Jewish texts. Sabiner, a bright boy and an outstanding student, was earmarked to become a leading rabbi.But he never forgot his dream. When he was 21 he confessed his ambition to his new wife. She was horrified: she had married him on the understanding that he would be a rabbinical leader. Also, he had no knowledge of science. But Sabiner’s yearning would not go away.Now 28, Sabiner is embarking on the final year of his medical degree. He will be the first person born and raised in a Haredi community in Israel to become a mainstream doctor, and he plans to specialise in internal medicine.Sabiner has benefited from a pioneering scheme at the Technion university in Haifa to draw young ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews from largely closed communities into mainstream education and then into the workforce.The numbers are still tiny – about 60 out of a total student population of 10,000. “But the idea is to bring the number to 200 within five years, and to 400 within 10 years,” said Prof Boaz Golani, a vice-president of the university. “Engaging the Haredi community is important for Israel. Having a civil society where entire segments live in their own world and with little interaction with others is not healthy. It’s a recipe for tension and animosity.”Traditionally, Haredi men are not economically active. Many spend their time in religious study, relying on state benefits to support their large families, which average almost seven children. But in recent years the Israeli government and educational institutions have taken steps to integrate the Haredi population into colleges and workforces.“There was a concentrated effort launched a few years ago by the ministry of transport, which needed more engineers,” said Golani. If the Technion could get Haredi students on to its courses, jobs could be guaranteed.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe Technion team identified 37 young men for a pre-university programme run from an anonymous rented warehouse in Bnei Brak. Over the course of 18 months, teachers tried to close a 12-year education gap to bring the Haredi men up to the standard of high school graduates.They studied from 8am to 10pm. “It was like a bootcamp, very intensive,” said Golani. “But they brought from the yeshivas an ability to study hard, to focus, to apply logic, so we built on these skills.” At the end of the programme, about half were admitted to the Technion they graduated this summer.Bringing the students up to the required educational standard was not the only challenge. Gender segregation, a norm in Haredi communities, was a big issue, Golani said. “We told them upfront that we would not allow gender segregation on campus, no way. We suggested they arrive at class 10 minutes early and sit together, and they accepted that. We also told them that we have female professors, and we will not tell them they can’t teach certain students. They accepted that too.”Some students have been ostracised by their communities. “One girl was boycotted by her friends. Someone else told me he was hiding for years, lying to his wife and family, telling them he was studying at another yeshiva when he was at the Technion.”The university also runs programmes aimed at encouraging Arab students to enrol. “That tends to be easier because their communities are eager to see them gain top-quality education and so the community resistance is much lower,” said Golani.It was essential to integrate “untapped resources” – meaning Arab-Israelis and ultra-Orthodox Jews – into the economy, he added. “The economy of Israel is largely based on the hi-tech sector. It’s the locomotive that carries the entire train of the Israeli economy. But we just don’t have enough people. Israel is a small country we’re not India or China.”Now that the end is in sight, he wants to encourage other Haredim to follow suit. “When I started the journey I said I don’t want to be a single episode. So I opened a group on social media telling other Haredim how they could become a doctor. Now we have 35 more in medical school.”Attitudes were changing, he said, with more integration and mutual understanding. “People understand we’re not a bottle of Coca-Cola on a production line, we’re iniduals. If you want to do medicine, you should do medicine, and if you want to be a lawyer, you should be a lawyer. And if you want to study the Torah, go for it.”• This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The SD leader, Jimmie Åkesson, boasted on Sunday that he would now have “immense influence over what happens in Sweden in the coming weeks, months, years”.Jon Henley, our reporter in Stockholm, writes that the famously open and tolerant nation was “facing a right-wing populist insurgency … that – despite a performance it will view as disappointing – has now become a very real political force”.Free advice for drinkers – It might not be what you want to hear on a Monday morning, but Britain’s ranks of middle-aged drinkers are being urged to have more alcohol-free days. A new campaign launched today called Drink Free Days aims to remind people that they increase the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer if they drink too much. Duncan Selbie, the chief executive of Public Health England, said he didn’t want to be “narking at people” but designating some days as booze-free was “an easy way to drink less and reduce the risks to your health”.‘Let’s be happy and dynamic’ – Boris Johnson has fuelled more speculation about his Tory leadership ambitions by using his regular newspaper column today to promote economic reforms centred around cuts to income tax, stamp duty and capital gains. In what reads suspiciously like an election manifesto, Johnson writes in the  that Britain should borrow from Donald Trump’s playbook and slash taxes to create a “happy and dynamic economy”. And the former Brexit minister Steve Baker has warned that Theresa May risks a “catastrophic split” in the Tory party if she pushes ahead with her Chequers plan. It follows a weekend when the party lurched towards civil war after the former foreign secretary described May’s plan for Brexit as a “suicide vest”.Paris attack – Two British tourists have been wounded in Paris after they were attacked by a man armed with a knife and an iron bar on Sunday night. The suspect has been arrested and was believed to be an Afghan national. However, nothing indicated any link to terrorism, sources told AFP news agency, adding that the attacker had targeted “strangers in the street”. Of the seven wounded, four were in a critical condition. Le Parisien newspaper said one of the Britons suffered a chest injury while the other was stabbed in the head.Case closed – The politan police last year dropped its investigations into 34,164 crimes on the day they were reported, compared with 13,019 the year before, according to figures obtained by the . In the first five months of this year, 18,093 crimes were closed in 24 hours, putting the number for the year on track to exceed last year’s total. The freedom of information data shows the number of sexual and drug offences being dropped are on the rise.The Clock is ticking again in Britain. The much-celebrated conceptual masterpiece by Christian Marclay is returning to London – where it was first screened – with a run at the Tate Modern until January. Peter Bradshaw explains how the American film-maker took clips of clocks from thousands of films to piece together one sequential 24-hour-long work of art. Featuring famous moments from High Noon, Pulp Fiction, The Stranger and innumerable scenes of Big Ben, Marclay relied on painstaking work by a team of researchers to hunt down the clips he needed. The results is a “mesmerising, dreamlike kaleidoscope that is also hilarious”.Alastair Cook will resume at the crease today on 46 not out in the final innings of his Test career after England consolidated a modest first innings lead on day three of the fifth Test against India. The loss of Cook’s experience for this winter’s tour to Sri Lanka has strengthened the case for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad being retained amid talk that one or both could be rested with a view to being fresher for next summer’s Ashes.Novak Djokovic had to come through two stirring Juan Martín Del Potro fightbacks to win his third US Open and 14th grand slam title, while Japan was ignoring the Serena Williams furore to celebrate Naomi Osaka becoming the first player from the country to win a major.Gareth Southgate has admitted his England side are still some way behind the world’s top teams, but says having a challenging Nations Cup group is important for his squad’s development.George Ford believes he has sharpened his attacking instincts after he was ousted by Danny Cipriani as England’s fly-half, but denied that losing his place was “a wake-up call”.And Amir Khan has said he wants “a super-fight with a massive name and I’d love it in a stadium” after Saturday’s victory over Samuel Vargas in Birmingham.The pound is buying €1.292 and $1.118.The ’s top story is “Met dropping more inquiries into serious crimes on first day”.

We believe that the consequences of inaction can be every bit as serious as intervening. The decision not to intervene in Syria has had very real consequences for Syrians, their neighbours, the UK and our allies.”MPs in 2013 voted not to back military action after Bashar al-Assad’s forces used chemical weapons in eastern Damascus. The vote contributed to Barack Obama’s decision to hold back from enforcing his red line on the use of chemical weapons.But the MPs say an inquiry needs to examine more than the circumstances of the Commons vote in August 2013 and to look more broadly into the devastating consequences of the international community’s failure to act both for Syrian refugees, chemical weapons use, the politics of the Middle East and relations between Russia and the west, including at UN security council.They write: “There has been a manifest failure to protect civilians and to prevent mass atrocity crimes in Syria. This failure has gone beyond the heavy toll paid by the Syrian people to the surrounding region, and had repercussions in Europe and the UK. It is the committee’s view that this failure derives principally not from the actions taken by the international community but inaction.“The international community’s inaction created an opportunity for others, particularly Russia and Iran, to intervene, changing the politics of the conflict in Syria. We believe the government needs to understand the role the UK’s inaction has had and learn the lessons from it for the future.”By only responding to chemcial weapon attacks and ignoring the Syrian government’s use of barrel bombs on civilian populations, the west was in danger of creating “a hierarchy of atrocities” in which only the most severe warrant response, the MPs add.The committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, said: “The people of Syria show clearly that choosing not to act, standing aside, can have consequences every bit as real and horrific as the decision to act. The government must do more to protect civilians as part of its responsibility to protect. With the situation in Idlib reaching crisis point, action to prevent mass atrocities is ever more urgent.”The MPs also urge the UK government to define more clearly its belief in the right to intervene militarily to prevent genocide or atrocities.The report admits deep isions exist about the legality of military intervention on humanitarian grounds, including whether it is prohibited by the UN charter or by the principles of national sovereignty. The report argues that the creators of the UN charter would not have sought to prohibit interventions designed to protect population from atrocities.The report also calls on the UK to urge UN security council members to agree to refrain from using their veto in the event of credible allegations of genocide, a proposal advanced by the then-French president François Hollande in 2013, but unlikely to gain Russian support.The committee blames Russia for using its UN veto repeatedly in Syria, saying: “It is an abuse of the moral responsibility entrusted to the permanent security council members to block action sought to prevent or alleviate suffering from mass atrocities.”The MPs argue: “Under specific circumstances, proportionate and necessary force should be available to be used as a last resort to alleviate extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale.“The absence of humanitarian intervention as a final recourse could result in the paralysis of the international system and a failure to act, resulting in grave consequences for civilian populations.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3619267.1536157475!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"are you paying over the odds for your tv package","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“By abandoning the live telly we never watched, we were able to justify spending money on the services we actually do watch without feeling even a twinge of guilt.” Photograph: Gabby JonesBloombergSometimes, when Pricewatch wants to terrify its children it tells them tales of what television was like in the bad old days.In the 1970s in the west of Ireland, people had access to one channel and that did not start broadcasting until 5pm in summer, with an extra hour allowed in winter.When it started, broadcasting didn’t really matter because what was on offer for children (and for adults) was – almost always – woeful. There were endless panel shows featuring men with cigarettes in their hands talking about farming – if memory serves – and apart from the odd Harold Lloyd or Laurel and Hardy short and the very occasional cartoon, it was no place for young folk.There were no remote controls, the idea of pausing live television was as far-fetched as sending men to Mars and the notion that thousands of hours of movies and television programmes could be streamed on demand was so outlandish that no one anywhere in the world had even begun to imagine such a thing.How the world has changed. Today mainstream television channels broadcast 24 hours a day, hundreds of channels are beamed into homes across the country and multiple streaming services compete for our attention while even more illegal services give people without scruples free access to movies and television shows that have yet to be legally released in this country.But with all the choice comes great confusion and sometimes great cost. A person with broadband access, a Virgin or Sky account and a Netflix subscription could handily spend more than €120 every month on television. A person with an interest in sport would have to spend much more than that by subscribing to multiple services to ensure they can watch football, golf, tennis and all the rest.Many people who pay big money for their television habits will not be getting good value for money.Value for money was on Pricewatch’s mind last May when we decided to practise what we preach. For years and years we had paid a provider for a service we almost never used, and so, after doing some sums, we called them and made a deal.The provider – their identity is irrelevant – was charging us just under €100 a month for a package that included (excellent) broadband, a landline – that has never been connected to the outside world – and a television service offering more than 100 channels, most of which were useless.Initially we tried to strip out two of the three elements, and asked if we could kill the TV and the landline. That proved impossible as the company appeared unwilling to allow us abandon a landline that no one ever called. We were, however, able to axe the telly package and by doing so we saw our monthly outgoings fall to under €60.That is a not-too-shabby saving of about €500 every year, and all thanks to a single phone call.Fast-forward five months and what have we missed by dropping the television from our bundle? Very little. Because the Pricewatch television is smart and has players from RTÉ and TV3 – or VMT as it is now called – on its home screen. The All4 app gives us Channel 4 and E4 content and, were we so inclined, we could use a virtual private network (VPN) to give us access to the BBC channels on the television.By making savings by abandoning the live telly we never watched, we were able to justify spending money on the services we actually do watch without feeling even a twinge of guilt, because the €40 a month saving we made almost covers the €10.99 a month that Netflix costs and the €30 we pay for Sky’s Now TV entertainment and movie packages.Netflix – for all its faults and its sometimes tired content – is still very good and routinely throws up gems. That is why it is increasingly popular and now used by more than 500,000 Irish households.Now TV is not as well-known but is arguably better. It effectively replicates many of the subscription services offered by its parent business on the cheap and without the need to sign up to a lengthy contract. It also allows us to buy a weekend or even day pass that will allow us to watch particular sporting events. We have never done such a thing but it’s nice to know we can.Pricewatch knows we could probably get most of the material found on both platforms for less – or for free, let’s be (dis)honest here – but by our reckoning it is worth paying for good content. That is why we also pay our TV licence, which costs €160 a year or just over €13 a month, without grumbling too much.While this is the road Pricewatch is currently travelling, there are other routes people take to cut the cost of their telly habits and there are also countless ways the really ruthless can access almost all the television in the world for nothingThe first thing you would need to do is circumvent the need to spend anything – including the €160 TV licence – would be to get rid of your television set. You must have a licence if you have a box in your house that is capable of receiving broadcast signals, but if you stream television on a laptop or a tablet or a monitor without a television tuner – as long as it is not hooked up to Vodafone TV or Eir Vision – then you don’t have to pay a licence fee. There was talk of rolling out a “broadcasting charge” to replace the licence fee but, after howls outrage from the public, the plans were shelved.If you don’t watch a huge amount, you could rely on the app FilmOnTV, available for both iOS and Android, to get access to live channels from all over the world including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. If you go over a set allowance, you will have to take out a subscription for €15 monthly.Other streaming services can be accessed via an Android box, which typically cost about €100. It would be remiss of us not to point out that many such services are in a legally grey area and the streams can be flaky and disappear in the blink of an eye.And of course there is Saorview, the national digital terrestrial television service. To get the service you just connect a suitable aerial to your Saorview approved TV and tune in to all the free-to-air Irish channels – and, depending on the box, free access to all the UK free-to-air channels too.He started with Sky Sports – an introductory offer costs €50 a month, climbing to €70 after six months. That will cover a lot of the soccer, some golf, hurling and football and a decent chunk of American football in the dead of night on Sundays.It is, however, no longer so good for rugby, with most Champions Cup and Pro 14 games on BT Sport and Eir Sport. The good news, he wrote , is that people who sign up to that package get more soccer, including more English Premier League, Champions League and Europa League games. The first three months cost €1 a month after which the cost rises to €27.50 a month.The Virgin Sports Media channel will cost another €20 a month while horse racing fans will probably have to sign up to Racing UK and pay another €31 a month.When these subscriptions are added up, it comes to €1,782 a year.But he wasn’t done. He added streaming service elevensports into the mix. “After pulling off the coup of signing up the UK and Ireland rights to La Liga and Serie A a couple of days before Cristiano Ronaldo signed for Juventus, they’re also the only place you can go next month to watch the USPGA Championship, the year’s last golf Major,” he wrote. If they charge just €15 a month the sports fan’s bill climbs to €2,000 a year.It is the easiest €3,000 I have ever saved, writes Paddy Logue.I haven’t looked back since the day almost five years ago when I cancelled my Sky subscription but kept access to more channels than there are hours in the day to watch them.It might sound like a dodgy “get rich quick” online ad, but such a cost-saving may be right in front of your nose as you read this.We had first signed up to a Sky television service when we moved house back in 2006. The Chorus satellite TV guys came around and said a signal could not be picked up in our new neighbourhood, so we were happy when Sky said they could hook us up. They duly fitted us out with two Sky boxes, a loop to a third television from one of them and a satellite dish at the end of the garden. For many years we happily watched whatever channels we wanted upstairs and downstairs. And in blissful ignorance €60 or so spirited itself out of our bank account and into Sky’s every month.But as time went on little annoyances began to creep into our relationship with the television provider. Their customer service department kept contacting me and threatening to cut off our service because one of the boxes was not hooked up to our telephone line (it was but they couldn’t tell that it was). Through this connection they had hoped to sell me extra pay-per-view services. Eventually they left me alone about this issue, but the trust was gone. I asked them, but they flat out refused, to give me, a long-standing customer, the discounts and offers afforded to people signing up for the first time. This really got to me.By the time 2013 came along, I was well and truly resentful of the €60 monthly bill. A simple cost-benefit analysis prompted me to phone Sky and cancel the service. So did we resort to playing Pontoon and charades every night instead? Of course not. In fact, we barely even noticed. We continued, and continue to this day, to enjoy all of the free-to-air channels piped in through the Sky dish and into the two boxes that we got back in 2006. So that’s all the main BBCs, ITV, Channel 4, Sky New, CNN, Channel 5, and many more. We even kept the “Red Button” service that is not available to Irish viewers in certain cases.In the meantime we have acquired a Samsung smart TV in a January sale for €300 and signed up to Netflix for €6.99 a month (which is now €9.99 per month). We do not have the Irish channels through the Sky boxes, but we get what we need by streaming them on the players and by plugging the laptop or phone into the television.By the end of 2018 we will have saved about €3,600 and, subtracting €300 for the television and another roughly €400 for Netflix, we have saved the guts of €3,000 by simply lifting the phone and saying “please cancel my subscription”.Eir: Eir Vision TV is only available if you bundle it with broadband and phone, and if you do opt for it you’ll get the Eir Sport pack included for free, which you can watch through your Eir box. Its TV Essential and Broadband, which also includes off-peak calls, costs €54.98 per month for 12 months after which it costs €74.98.Sky: The big satellite player. It gives you access to Sky Atlantic, and the Sky Q 1TB box comes as standard. You will also get access to the Sky Go app. The no-frills TV option gives you 50 channels for €29.50 a month. Add broadband and the price climbs to €59.50 a month.Virgin TV: The other big player in the market. It is available as a stand-alone TV package or as part of a bundle with broadband. As with Sky there are multiple options and different prices. Its Freedom TV offering gives access to 20 channels for €20 a month, and the contract runs from month to month. Its Full House deal, meanwhile gives you access to 114 channels for €35 a month. Sign up to TV and broadband bundle and you pay €49 per month for 12 months, then €89 a month after that. It should be noted that it has the fastest broadband commonly found on the market.Vodafone: TV is only available if bundled with broadband. Customers can opt for a broadband and TV package, or one that also includes home phone. Its TV \u0026amp Simply Broadband plus calls gives you 60 channels and looks attractive at €25 a month, but that jumps to €75-€85 per month after six months."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3610271.1536059095!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan ahead to get ahead","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHigher Options has the potential to be the most valuable six hours you will be able to spend this year in exploring your future options. Photograph: Alan Betson Organised by the The  and the Institute of Guidance Counsellors in the RDS, Dublin, in September every year, the Higher Options conference is the starting point for many students as they begin to plan the next phase of their educational journey.It brings together representatives of institutions and organisations offering fifth year, transition year and Leaving Cert students information on almost every conceivable educational progression opportunity available.Its benefit to school-leavers depends entirely on each student’s level of preparation prior to the event. This preparation will have been ongoing over the previous two years through career exploration activities undertaken in transition year and fifth year. The Institute of Guidance Counsellors provides students attending the event, through their guidance counsellors in schools, a comprehensive preparation document to enable them to plan their engagements throughout the day. By working through this document, students maximise the benefits of attending the conference. Careful planning and an understanding of what they need to accomplish at Higher Options will hugely enhance the long-term value of attending. Guidance counsellors provide students with details of various talks at the event covering every conceivable topic relevant to progression to higher or further education. Timetables need to be studied beforehand as decisions will need to be taken on which talks to attend. Given the hundreds of exhibitors and the thousands of courses and other options on offer, attendees should draw up a list of colleges or other exhibitors they want to talk to. They should also compose a series of written questions they wish to tease out with the representatives on the stands. Each stand holder will, of course, present the most positive picture possible of the benefits of the various options which their organisation offers. All students can do is engage systematically with each one and after returning home sift the information received to enable them to move their career-planning process on to the next stage. Stand holders will not expect students to make a final decision concerning their future career options based only on attending a talk in the RDS or following a visit to a stand at Higher Options. But, for those who plan their activities in advance, these interactions will in fact help set the agenda for each student in the months and years ahead.If they have done their homework, many students will have developed very clear course preferences by the time they step into the exhibition centre at Higher Options. Some might learn they are not likely to secure the high points required for their preferred course or are not taking the subjects necessary to meet the minimum requirements for entry. This is where Higher Options can be of real value. Rather than feeling downcast and disbanding thoughts of their preferred career, they will have the opportunity at Higher Options to visit other stands where they will learn about other options that might enable them to achieve their dream course by another route. There are hundreds of high-points CAO programmes across all disciplines which are also accessible through Further Education (FE) one-year level 5 programmes. Many of these FE colleges have stands at Higher Options. Go and talk to them.Alternatively, while CAO points requirements are very high for many programmes in Ireland, European universities have a very different system. They simply require two H5s and four passes to gain entry to many courses which require more than 500 points in Ireland. Again, these colleges have stands in the RDS. The courses are taught through English and fees are modest to non-existent. Once a student’s interest has been heightened by an interaction at Higher Options, consolidated and strengthened perhaps by a close reading of the literature, the next step should be to plan a visit to the college in question. No Leaving Cert student should seriously consider making a long-term course career decision without visiting the institution in question and soaking in the atmosphere of the place. Remember, choosing a course commits you to far more than just a set of lectures and exams over several years. Choosing a course or college is like committing to a long-term relationship and it commits you to a lifestyle and a range of social and extra-curricular activities offered by the institution in question. Every student is different in both personality and interests. Some will revel in the cut-and-thrust of very large colleges, while others may prefer smaller institutions where everyone gets to know each other very quickly. Students who select their course choices based solely on the details of the course itself without considering the context within which it is delivered can often find that they have made a bad choice very quickly. Having attended Higher Options now for more than 20 years, it has become clear to me that many students attend without having given any serious thought to why they are there. They drift around the complex for a few hours, become bored and can be seen drifting up Anglesea Road with a plastic bag full of prospectuses, which is sometimes dumped as it becomes too heavy to carry. They will return to their schools the following day having received absolutely no benefit from their attendance at the event. Before you find yourself in this position, consider the opportunity that you have at Higher Options. Months of hard work has taken place to bring together under one roof hundreds of options from the four corners of the world that will be open to you in September 2019. This has the potential to be the most valuable six hours you will be able to spend this year in exploring your future options.Use it wisely and build on it in the weeks and months ahead.Higher Options 2018 will take place at the RDS Simmonscourt, Dublin, on September 12th, 13th and 14th, from 9am-3pm each day"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Businessman Gavin Duffy and Senator Joan Freeman secure one nomination eachTwo buckets of suspected D10 (benzodiazepines) and box of prescription drugs seizedValue of Higher Options to school-leavers depends entirely on level of preparation ahead of RDS eventCllr Niall McNelis punched in face when he tried to help woman being attacked by a manUK company Go-Ahead commences services with launch of route from Citywest to UCDSurveys show the number of Irish children able to speak a second language well below the EU normIf key targets not met, Murphy threatens to transfer responsibility for emergency shelterSt Joseph\u0026rsquos National School in Aughavas faces September 30th deadlineMany commentators missing what the church is, claims Diarmuid MartinSelling land for top price not yielding best result, says society of chartered urveyorsComments come ahead of meeting with new Garda Commissioner Drew HarrisVicky Phelan and others affected have sought details on report before publicationHandy tips to help you make the most of all that is on offer at Higher OptionsDo your homework first then ask questions tailored to you and your circumstances1,000 locals have signed petition opposing council plan to close Waterloo JunctionIt\u0026rsquos important for students to prepare before visiting the expo in order to make the most of the opportunityThe experts say you should ask prepared questions on the courses that interest youThere\u0026rsquos more to visiting Ireland\u0026rsquos education expo than a day off school or getting freebies \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a great opportunity to learn more about what university you might end up attendingEnrolling in universities abroad is a realistic opportunity for Irish students to follow their dreams\u0026Aacuteras hopeful speaks of miracle cure and No in abortion referendum"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3623256.1536503696!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"five fold increase in uk nationals becoming irish citizens","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFine Gael Senator Neale Richmond said: “Such a spike is clearly tied to the Brexit referendum and the uncertainty that has prevailed since the vote.” Photograph: Alan BetsonThe number of British nationals becoming naturalised Irish citizens has surged since the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, new figures show.Department of Justice statistics show that the number of UK nationals swapping British for Irish citizenship increased five-fold after the Brexit referendum, rising from 98 in 2016 to 529 in 2017.The 2016 figure was almost double the previous year’s figure of 54. The information was released by the department to Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond, the chairman of the Seanad’s special committee on Brexit and his party’s EU affairs spokesman in the Seanad.“Such a spike is clearly tied to the Brexit referendum and the uncertainty that has prevailed since the vote,” Mr Richmond said. There are more than 300,000 British nationals living in the State, he said, and estimated that about a third of these would not qualify for an Irish passport through lineage.The Fine Gael senator said many who had applied for Irish citizenship had done so because they were “very worried that they would find themselves high and dry” after the UK leaves the EU next March.“I do get quite a lot of representations, an awful lot of my constituents who are English or Scottish and working in good jobs who are not going back to the UK at this stage,” he said.There was still strong and growing interest in applying for citizenship, even though the cost of applying for citizenship, about €1,100 was the second highest in the EU after Austria, he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs said earlier this year that Brexit was “undoubtedly” the reason behind a 25 per cent rise in applications for Irish passports in the first four months of this year compared with the same period in 2016. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesLithuanian and Korean will be taught from this week as part of a drive to ersify the number of languages on the curriculum in Irish schools. Lithuanian will be a short course for junior cycle in schools in Dublin and Monaghan where there is the highest concentration of the country’s natives in Ireland. According to the last census in 2016, 36,683 Lithuanians live in Ireland. However, the Lithuanian embassy estimates the real figure is twice that if the number of children of immigrants are taken into account. The course is for a minimum of 100 hours over two years. Some 43 applicants were received from teachers of the language. The introduction of Lithuanian into Irish school is part of the foreign languages strategy which identifies the need to support immigrant communities to maintain their own languages. It was introduced last year as part of a 10-year strategy to prepare Ireland for Brexit through a series of steps such as potential bonus Central Applications Office (CAO) points for studying foreign languages. The Korean language, the 17th most spoken language in the world, is being introduced as a module for transition year. Trade between South Korea and Ireland reached €1.8 billion in 2015. The language will be introduced into four schools in Dublin.  French accounts for more than half of all language sits in the Leaving Certificate, followed by German (13 per cent), Spanish (11 per cent) and Italian (1 per cent). Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the teaching and learning of foreign languages is a priority in the post-Brexit world. Surveys have repeatedly shown that the number of Irish children able to speak a second language is well below the EU norm. Only about 20 per cent of Irish adults know one foreign language, compared with the European average of 35 per cent.Mr Bruton added: “Not only do we need to increase the number of languages taught, but we need to deepen the level of fluency and competency in these languages among our students. “In the context of Brexit and the increasing importance globally of non-English speaking countries, I want to take action to ensure Ireland is well prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.”From this September, the first students will begin studying the Leaving Certificate computer science and physical education courses. Both subjects are being introduced to an initial group of schools, before both are rolled out nationally in 2020 to all schools who wish to teach them. Politics and society, which has gone through this initial phase, with its first set of students sitting the Leaving Certificate exam this year, is now available to all schools who wish to teach the subject."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3624014.1536571824!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential campaign gallagher receives his first council nomination","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSean Gallagher is considered the most likely candidate to secure four council endorsements Businessman Sean Gallagher has received his first nomination for presidency following a vote by Roscommon County Council.Senator Joan Freeman, who received her first nomination from Cork City Council last Monday, received three votes from Roscommon County Council while journalist Gemma O’Doherty received two votes. Councils around the country will continue to vote today on their nominations for the upcoming presidential election. Monaghan County Council met at 10am to discuss potential presidential candidates and to decide whether it will support the nomination of a candidate. Mayo County Council will meet at 11am on Monday to hear from presidential candidates. At 2pm Fingal County Council, Kilkenny County Council and Offaly County Council will all hold special events to hear from candidates and decide on the nomination of a candidate. Gemma O’Doherty is due to speak at the event in Fingal’s Council Chamber in Swords and the event will be webcast.At 2.30pm Wexford County Council will decide who to nominate as presidential candidate following pitches by three candidates last week and South Dublin County Council will meet at 3.30pm to discuss the presidential nomination. Wicklow County Council will meet at 7pm to agree on a nomination after hearing from candidates last week. Leitrim County Council is due to vote on Monday with Sean Gallagher expected to receive the nomination. Galway City Council and Galway County Council will both vote on Monday after nine potential candidates made pitches at a five-hour meeting last Thursday. Galway County Council is expected to finalise its nomination. Candidates need four nominations from councils or the backing of 20 Oireachtas members to run for presidency on October 26th. Mr Gallagher is considered the most likely to secure four council endorsements followed by Gavin Duffy and Joan Freeman.Mr Duffy became the first candidate to secure a nomination last week after he received the backing of Meath County Council. Ms Freeman received her first nomination from Cork City Council last Monday. Ms Freeman, who vote against the removal of the Eighth Amendment from the Constitution last May has said that if elected president her personal conviction would have absolutely no impact” on her public duty. “The voice of the people has been heard and there probably will have to be amendments to legislation. That comes with every legislation. We’ll just have to wait and see what is suggested.”Mr Gallagher told Galway councillors last week that he was not seeking to “replace” President Michael D Higgins, but wished to be his “successor” and “carry on with the great work he had undertaken” for the past seven years. His priorities would include launching a year of disability from December 3rd this year which would focus on the 900,000 people across Ireland with a disability, along with their carers and families.Mr Gallagher is believed to have secured sufficient backing in Leitrim, Roscommon, Cavan and Wexford, which will give him the required minimum of four local authorities.Journalist and presidential hopeful Gemma O’Doherty clashed with members of Clare County Council last week over her claims that there was State collusion in the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin.At a meeting of the council in Ennis to hear pitches from some of those seeking a nomination to contest next month’s election, Ms O’Doherty alleged that Ms Guerin’s brother, Cllr Jimmy Guerin, had defamed her in a tweet posted last weekend about the matter.Ms O’Doherty said she did her work “on behalf of the Irish people” and that if she felt something was being covered up, nothing would silence her. She said she had been told of collusion in the murder by “a decent honest” member of the Garda and that the issue was not put in the public domain as part of her manifesto.Separately, Fianna Fáil TD Éamon Ó Cuív has said he is declining offers to run for the presidency as he would “not do anything” that would force him to leave his party or “cause ision”.In a letter sent to Fianna Fáil Galway county councillors, the TD has described an offer by them in July to nominate him as “generous and flattering”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3623386.1536512723!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd on new zealand s pm jacinda ardern","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJacinda Ardern, New Zealand prime minister   with partner Clarke Gayford and their  daughter Neve at  home in Auckland. Photograph: Derek HendersonJacinda Ardern via APAt first, the skies were cloudless in the Land of the Long White Cloud.When she took office last October at 37, Jacinda Ardern was celebrated with sunny abandon as New Zealand’s youngest prime minister in 150 years and only the second world leader (after Benazir Bhutto in 1990) to give birth and the first to take maternity leave (six weeks). Vogue ran a piece christening Ardern the “Anti-Trump,” with a picture of the prime minister in a cream trench coat on a craggy beach that was so dramatic and glamorous that some on the internet mistook it for a publicity still for a TV detective show. She is part of the club of young, progressive leaders, along with Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, trying to counter President Donald Trump’s ugly impulses against the environment and multilateralism.In a sartorial triumph, Ardern wore a feathered Maori cloak to meet Queen Elizabeth at a black-tie dinner in London.“It was highly coveted among the princesses at the dinner,” Ardern’s partner, Clarke Gayford, told me. “They made a beeline for her, and I’m surprised she managed to leave wearing it, to be completely honest.”As “Jacindamania” swept the globe, Ardern was hailed as an exciting avatar of women’s future in politics. In the United States, where a stampede of women – including young mothers – is seeking office in 2018, it seemed almost a preview of what could be possible, albeit one with much better scenery.She was going to be able to run a country and nurse a baby at the same time – without a nanny or a wedding ring! The boyish and charming Gayford, the 40-year-old host of a TV fishing show who smiles with delight no matter how many times he is asked “Is Jacinda your greatest catch?” would be the stay-at-home dad who would show the way for modern men.Why had it taken us so long to realise how seamless it could all be?Then Ardern took her first official trip since she gave birth to her daughter, Neve, 11 weeks ago and the fantasy of easy equality evaporated.She has been forced to justify abbreviating her trip to the Pacific Islands Forum on the island of Nauru from three days to one, flying separately from her foreign affairs minister, Winston Peters, on an Air Force jet – at a cost of about $50,000 in US dollars – so that she could breastfeed her daughter. Neve was too young to get the vaccinations necessary to go along. Even though Ardern had to fly there in the middle of the night and fly back a day later in the middle of the night, she wanted to attend because all Kiwi prime ministers consider it a can’t-miss and also because she didn’t want to seem like she was shying away from an ongoing debate with Australia, as she tries to rescue refugees from the hideous holding facilities in Nauru, the shame of Australia.Critics said Ardern should have gone for the whole three days or just stayed home and left the duties to Peters, who was “more than capable of holding court with all the local leaders over a drink at happy hour,” as morning TV host Duncan Garner huffed.Never mind that in a nation dependent on tourism, Jacinda is the biggest thing to hit here since Frodo dropped the ring into Mount Doom. Her ministers had to defend her.“This is an aircraft and a crew who would be working anyway,” Grant Robertson, the finance minister, told the press. “We allocate a certain amount of money to them each year, so it’s either this flight or another flight.’’And Peters told me that he knew of an instance when a man in government here “with less authority and status who did that and no media beat him up. She should ignore the craven, cowardly trolls.”But she is not ignoring the trolls. When I met her at her gray frame bungalow, a few hours after she got home, she was handing off her big black briefcase to an aide at the door, breastfeeding her daughter and anguishing about what she calls her “damned if I do, damned if I don’t” moment.“What surprised me the most is how hard I took that, being given a hard time for going, but actually it did upset me a bit,” she said, wearing jeans with holes in the knees and a maternity pullover, kicking off her fuzzy leopard slippers and sitting in bare feet on the floor of the living room. Gayford stood in the kitchen, cradling the beautiful baby in a blue-and-white striped blanket. (In a cosmic wink, Neve was born on Bhutto’s birthday.)“In New Zealand, we’re really careful about excess,” said Ardern, who bought her maternity clothes at Kmart and frequents secondhand stores. The country even resisted the global pandemic of Starbucks. “I hate the idea of anyone thinking that I don’t put a lot of thought about the cost to taxpayers. I make our ministers travel to events in vans to pool together.” She instituted a salary freeze last month that stopped a 3 per cent raise for her and the members of parliament.“I want to be a good leader, not a good lady leader,” Ardern said, stretching out her legs. “I don’t want to be known simply as the woman who gave birth.”I reassure her that in the United States, where we love excess, Trump has cost us more than $70 million so far on trips to his golf clubs. When president Barack Obama spent an estimated $72,000 to go to Manhattan for date night with Michelle, he was hailed as a romantic hero. I wrote a column noting that, as a taxpayer, I was “most happy” to contribute to our urbane president’s date nights.Ardern’s official residence is in Wellington. The Auckland bungalow is surprisingly small and down-to-earth for a prime minister, with knitted items for the baby sent by New Zealanders and toys strewn around. There’s a pink cardboard box full of congratulatory notes from the Queen, Prince Charles and world leaders. Gayford has just renovated the deck and is working on the front path. As cyberbullying is to Melania, saving the oceans is to Clarke. Ardern, who intends to teach her daughter Maori, has magnets with Maori numbers from one to 10 on the refrigerator and gave Neve a middle name of Te Aroha.The couple met when he got in touch with her about a constituency issue – a bill that Gayford worried would erode privacy. They share a love of DJ-ing and a droll sense of humor. She teased him during one joint interview that she could never shield her daughter from the sight of his dad sweater. And when he saw Ardern’s Vogue spread, he tweeted, “Well that’s the desktop sorted”.When a columnist wrote a nasty piece dismissing the First Bloke as a “hipster salty sea dog,” he tweeted a picture of himself holding a fish and calling it another bottom feeder.I ask Ardern if she is surprised that America has not yet had a woman at the top.“Yes,” she shot back. “But I was equally surprised at the debate about universal health care. That’s not something we question here.”Despite its beer and rugby bro culture, New Zealand is more progressive than Australia, where female leaders are lining up to call out sexism and bullying. Aotearoa, the Maori name for New Zealand, is celebrating 125 years of suffrage and its third woman prime minister. But Ardern says there’s still work to be done.“I got this letter today from a young woman that was so lovely, I just scribbled a reply back,” she said. “She got pregnant around the same time as me and she just felt like her boss was more willing to be flexible because he saw this expectation being built around making sure that women could have babies and remain in their jobs. And I thought, well, even if I only create that sentiment or that environment or even create a little bit of solidarity for other women, that is something.”She wants to show that women can lead with different styles, not cast themselves in the egotistical, brash mold of many male politicians. “One of the criticisms I’ve faced over the years is that I’m not aggressive enough or assertive enough or maybe somehow, because I’m empathetic, it means I’m weak,” she said. “I totally rebel against that. I refuse to believe that you cannot be both compassionate and strong.”She calls Gayford Huckleberry Finn, because he often wears shorts, even for interviews, and wanders around with a fishing pole. She grew up in a rural town, the daughter of a police detective and farmer, so she learned how to make tools and drive a tractor. She prides herself on being a “pointy head” and “girlie swat” because she enjoys the thick briefing books she studies every night.Ardern met Trump in November at the East Asia summit in Vietnam. It came out that at first Trump mistook Ardern for Sophie Trudeau. When he realised who she was, he playfully told someone standing near her, “This lady caused a lot of upset in her country”. She retorted, laughing, “No one marched when I was elected.” She did not tell Trump that she herself joined the global women’s march the day after his inauguration.Ardern is so committed to moral leadership, I wondered what she made of the charge in the explosive anonymous New York Times op-ed piece about Trump’s “amorality” and how his aides are working to ameliorate his habit of roughing up allies and flirting with foes. New Zealand, after all, is part of the Five Eyes intelligence coalition. And while Silicon Valley types might be marshaling bunkers and building panic rooms in New Zealand for the apocalypse, Washington was already in an apocalypse. Doesn’t she ever call the prime minister of Canada and yell, “OMG, Justin! Are you seeing this?”With classic New Zealand understatement, Ardern replied: “Well, I mean, there was a time when things were a lot more predictable than they are now.” She said she is not fearful because she believes the checks in the American system will hold.Trump will be presiding over the UN Security Council when the General Assembly meets in New York later this month. The prime minister will be trying to combine mothering and traveling again, this time hopefully with less ludicrous commentary. She will be juggling more than 40 events in seven days, with Neve and Gayford as part of the entourage.I wonder if she worries that she will do something to evoke Trump’s wrath and get a nickname hurled at her.“I’ve been given so many, it’d be quite hard to come up with a new one,” she said, laughing. “Back in the early days of my political career, I was called Socialist Cindy. I just hate the nickname Cindy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The US wants Kim to proceed with denuclearisation first, but North Korea wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53. North Koreans wave flowers at Kim Jong-un as he surveys their procession from a balconyHowever, the stalemate has been showing signs of softening in recent days. On Friday President Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a personal letter from Kim Jong-un was going to be delivered soon. “I think it’s going to be a positive letter,” he predicted. Earlier the president had tweeted his thanks to Kim for his “unwavering faith” in him, adding “We will get it done together!” in reference to denuclearisation. Flare-up: aeroplanes forming the number 70 fly in formation “Kim and Trump are trading gestures to appease the US Congress and show to the world that the deal is on. And, indeed, the deal is on but Kim will not fully denuclearise,” North Korea analyst Loretta Napoleoni told The . Analysts have repeatedly warned that despite the current thaw on the Korean Peninsula, Kim has never committed to fully surrendering his nuclear weapons.  Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted that the understated nature of the Pyongyang parade indicated that North Korea “wants a version of the Israel deal.”He explained: “They don’t test nuclear weapons or show them off at parades we pretend they don’t exist.”According to reporters at the scene, the parade was split into two sections, civilian and military. The military segment featured soldiers wearing uniforms from different periods of national history, then switching to civilian groups, ranging from nurses to construction workers alongside colourful floats. Kim Jong-un clasps the hand of Chinese envoy, Li Zhanshu during the paradeKim surveyed the procession from a balcony in Kim Il Sung square, at times locking hands with Li Zhanshu, a senior envoy sent by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Foreign delegations from Russia, Syria, Vietnam and African nations reflected Kim’s concerted push this year in terms of promoting his own personal diplomacy and trying to cultivate a more statesman-like image.French actor Gerard Depardieu was in attendanceIn a break from recent tradition, he did not address the crowd. Instead Kim Yong-nam, the country’s ceremonial head of state told the audience that North Korea had achieved status as a military power, and would now pursue efforts to strengthen its economy.A gala was held on the eve of the 70th anniversaryThe anniversary celebrations also mark the revival of North Korea\u0027s iconic mass games after a five-year hiatus. The mass games involve tens of thousands of people performing precisely choreographed dancing in a symbol of national unity.  This year\u0027s spectacle - tickets start at just over $100 and go up to more than $800 per seat - also has a strong economic theme.Texas police officer faces manslaughter charge over \u0026#39wrong flat\u0026#39 fatal shooting of neighbourParis knife rampage: Two British tourists among seven wounded as bystanders throw boules at attackerBoris Johnson\u0026#39s allies criticise Number 10 \u0026#39dirty dossier\u0026#39 designed to damage his reputationMiddle-aged drinkers urged to have two days off alcohol each weekBodyguard spoilers: who\u0026#39s behind the conspiracy? Comment: Sajid Javid mustn\u0026#39t leave it up to the tech giants to crack down on child sexual abuse onlineThai production set to be first in race to make cave rescue filmComment: We need to change the way we talk about suicideMake tourists pay \u0026#39hotel tax\u0026#39 to keep museums free, V\u0026ampA director suggestsChange the way we talk about suicide, campaigners urgeJohn Swinney under pressure over Holyrood motion calling for primary one tests to be scrappedLeslie Moonves resigns as CBS CEO over sexual misconduct claimsMS patients denied drug which could keep them out of wheelchair Stalking victims given power to appeal against lenient sentences for the first time under government plansBritain\u0026#39s first \u0026#39air taxis\u0026#39 will be picking up passengers within four years, company claims politan Police drops tens of thousands of cases within hours of them being reported by victimsMan arrested after using petrol pump to put out lit cigarette was high on Monkey Dust drug Comment: Don\u0026#39t put up taxes.

The rupee fell to 71.785 per dollar on Wednesday, although it recovered somewhat to trade at 71.915 to the dollar in early Thursday trading.This follows a previous drop to a record low of 69.62 rupees per dollar last month, in the wake of the Turkish economic crisis.Decline in the rupee came as investors abandoned emerging market assets - EM equities entered a bear market this week, marking a 20 per cent decline from their peak in January. “Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold emerging market assets,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “However, the prospects of more US interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in.” \u0026nbspPresident Trump is expected to announce another round of tariffs on $200bn (£155bn) worth of Chinese goods in the coming days. “Going ahead with these tariffs (will) suggest that a full-blown trade war has just kicked off and more pain will be felt across the globe,” Mr Sayed added. John Ferguson, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: “Most emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable. However, investors are on the alert for financial, economic or political weaknesses.”“The turbulence experienced by Argentina and Turkey in mid-2018 is a reminder of how difficult it can be for policymakers to regain market confidence where external imbalances are large and macroeconomic policy frameworks are fragile.”Mr Ferguson added: “For now, a full-blown emerging-market crisis should be averted, but we expect the number of countries seeing their currencies come under pressure to rise over the next two years. It is likely that we will see periods of volatility as the global trade dispute interacts with the shift away from easy money.”Trump’s unrelenting trade war won\u0027t push us into a recessionSouth African rand weakens as economy enters recessionChaos in Turkey feeds fears of wider emerging market crisisMeanwhile, Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, noted that the selloff in emerging markets has spread beyond Turkey and Argentina to some of the developing world’s largest economies such as Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and South Africa - the rand dropped on Wednesday after it emerged the South African economy had entered recession.“These economies are seeing a sharp selloff in both stocks and currencies which is unnerving investors, with fears of contagion sending European shares lower and contributing to a softer open on Wall Street,” said Ms Cincotta. “Whilst Turkey and Argentina started out as the weakest links in the EM space, investors have been shaken and are broadly looking to reduce their exposure with investors questioning which economies are most vulnerable and where is spill over likely.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/07/23/Jamie-Oliver-Getty.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/07/23/Jamie-Oliver-Getty.jpg","title":"jamie oliver tesco sainsbury s healthy food","story":"Created with Sketch.New partnership follows difficult year for the TV chef, whose restaurant chains have been rocked by financial problemsClick to followThe IndependentMr Oliver is well known as an outspoken campaigner for healthy eatingJamie Oliver is the new face of TescoJamie Oliver has signed up with Tesco in a partnership aimed at promoting healthier options for shoppers, seven years after the TV chef’s deal with Sainsbury’s came to an end. Mr Oliver will begin his new promotional campaign with ‘helpful little swaps’, which will offer healthier and cheaper alternatives to customers.Tesco said a basket of ‘swaps’, which will include products with reduced levels of sugar, salt and fat, will cost 12 per cent less than a regular basket. Tesco said the partnership followed a survey of 2,000 people which revealed 70 per cent of people think supermarkets should do more to help people make healthier choice. “These survey results back up what I hear from my audience every single day – Britain wants to know how to enjoy more of the good stuff, in easy fun and delicious ways,” said Mr Oliver. “This makes this partnership one of the most exciting opportunities to actually get Britain eating and celebrating more of their five fruit and veg a day.“I’m going to work really hard to respond to the different seasons and what the customer is asking for, by creating exciting meals, shortcuts and tips that get people really fired up to cook. Tesco’s part is to make it easier and more affordable.”Jamie Oliver shouldn\u0027t be pricing poor people out of pizza dealsHow much influence do TV ads actually have?Alessandra Bellini, chief customer officer for Tesco, said: “Jamie’s passion and skill to inspire a nation to cook, coupled with our experience and reach in providing millions of customers and colleagues with healthy, quality, affordable ingredients will be a great combination to help people take simple steps to leading healthier lives. This is a natural step in our ongoing work to make healthier eating a little easier.“Tesco will have its third health event in store this month and we are excited to have Jamie fronting up the helpful little swaps encouraging customers to buy products lower in fat, salt and sugar, as well as tasty, healthy recipes to try.”Mr Oliver was previously the face of Tesco rival Sainsbury’s, in a partnership that ran for 11 years and was believed to be worth more than £1m annually. His departure from the supermarket in 2011 was said to be amicable, however, during his time working for Sainsbury’s, Mr Oliver criticised the company for its use of battery chickens. The chef runs a business empire ning recipe books, cooking utensils and restaurants. In recent years, he has run into financial difficulties which have led to the closure of several branches of his Jamie’s Italian chain and all of his Union Jacks restaurants, while London-based Barbecoa collapsed into administration earlier this year.

Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup. The construction sector also bounced back after a weak start to the year,” said Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics.Since July the ONS has been publishing a monthly GDP estimate, replacing it’s traditional quarterly release.The UK’s GDP growth comes in the context of a growing global economy, fuelled by Donald Trump’s tax cuts in the US and a cyclical bounce-back\u0026nbspin the eurozone.The Bank of England has estimated that the level of the UK’s GDP is still set to be around 2 per cent lower by the end of 2018 than it would have been in the absence of the 2016 Brexit, which pushed up inflation and hit consumption.That translates into a hit of around £900 per UK household.However, the growth recovery this year since the slump to zero in February appears to vindicate the view of the Bank that the weakness in GDP was predominantly due to the snow disruption, rather than an underlying slowdown.“The more timely survey evidence suggests that the economy grew at about 0.4 per cent in August, so the strength of GDP growth seen in July may prove to be fleeting,” said Andrew Wishart\u0026nbspof Capital Economics.“Indeed, the surveys suggest that while the contraction in manufacturing has now come to an end, the sector will continue to lag behind services.”Separately, the ONS reported that the UK trade deficit was £3.4bn in the three months to July, down £1.4bn on the previous quarter.Exports rose 3.3 per cent, outstripping the 2.4 per cent increase in imports.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/06/10/rts1x5zl.jpg","title":"indian rupee dollar exchange rate all time low investors emerging markets","story":"Created with Sketch.The prospect of US interest rate hikes and global trade tensions are hurting emerging marketsClick to followThe IndependentThe Indian currency was rocked last month by the Turkish crisisThe Indian rupee has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar, in a tough week for emerging market currencies amid investor concerns about a potential trade war.

Mr Oliver will begin his new promotional campaign with ‘helpful little swaps’, which will offer healthier and cheaper alternatives to customers.Tesco said a basket of ‘swaps’, which will include products with reduced levels of sugar, salt and fat, will cost 12 per cent less than a regular basket. Tesco said the partnership followed a survey of 2,000 people which revealed 70 per cent of people think supermarkets should do more to help people make healthier choice. “These survey results back up what I hear from my audience every single day – Britain wants to know how to enjoy more of the good stuff, in easy fun and delicious ways,” said Mr Oliver. “This makes this partnership one of the most exciting opportunities to actually get Britain eating and celebrating more of their five fruit and veg a day.“I’m going to work really hard to respond to the different seasons and what the customer is asking for, by creating exciting meals, shortcuts and tips that get people really fired up to cook.

This is a natural step in our ongoing work to make healthier eating a little easier.“Tesco will have its third health event in store this month and we are excited to have Jamie fronting up the helpful little swaps encouraging customers to buy products lower in fat, salt and sugar, as well as tasty, healthy recipes to try.”Mr Oliver was previously the face of Tesco rival Sainsbury’s, in a partnership that ran for 11 years and was believed to be worth more than £1m annually. His departure from the supermarket in 2011 was said to be amicable, however, during his time working for Sainsbury’s, Mr Oliver criticised the company for its use of battery chickens. The chef runs a business empire ning recipe books, cooking utensils and restaurants. In recent years, he has run into financial difficulties which have led to the closure of several branches of his Jamie’s Italian chain and all of his Union Jacks restaurants, while London-based Barbecoa collapsed into administration earlier this year.

This places me as a contender for ’s BAME awards or the Jhalak prize, both aimed at BAME writers like myself. Ah, BAME – this acronym, which means black, Asian and minority ethnic, joins many other appellations offered over the decades (not all of them very nice), painstaking\u0026nbspattempts to address the complexities of a multicultural society. But isn’t it, despite its best intentions, rather limiting?\u0026nbspAs a child in Zambia, I was a mwenye, if the speaker wished to be disparaging (it’s an unflattering term that I won’t translate). In most contexts my family was “Indian”, while we regarded ourselves as Keralites (being Indian was secondary). Back in Kerala, if denoted by religion, we were proud to be “Syrian Christians”, members of a Catholic congregation predating the arrival of Islam in India, formed by the disciple Doubting Thomas. Of course this meant we were a cut above those “Latin Christians” who had converted centuries after to curry favour with their Portuguese colonisers.\u0026nbspLater, as a teenager in a new Zimbabwe, I was once again “Indian” and, in a Harare which had been segregated under the Rhodesians, my family should thus have lived in the suburb of Belvedere, which was the Indian zone, rather than as we did on the edge of the “coloured” (mixed\u0026nbsprace) Braeside. I resisted these tortuous preoccupations with skin tones and bloodlines – and by my late teens, inspired by the rising tide which was turning against apartheid in South Africa, I was resolutely, in my eyes, “black”.But when I arrived in the UK, I was suddenly “Asian” – defined by a great continent, of which my home state in India was a mere slender slip of a thing. I was properly foreign, with a student visa stamped in my Indian passport, but my proficiency in English led many to believe I was “British Asian”, alongside an assumption that I was second generation British, well versed in both Withnail and I and the career of reggae DJ Apache Indian, and full of fond memories of that incredible summer of 1976. I have done my homework since, as you can see.\u0026nbspI returned to Africa as a young woman, and when living and working in Mozambique, I was a monye – another disparaging term, not dissimilar to mwenye, but this sobriquet was seasoned with the erroneous assumptions of being Muslim and wealthy. Then, on to the tiny island of Bioko, part of Equatorial Guinea, where I was memorably known as la chica blanca – the white girl. Oh yes, and in Spain some years later, I was declared a hindou, the religious isions that beset my homeland refreshingly ignored. Reader, an identity crisis in the making.The journey so farBut, actually not. For, observers often overlook the ID\u0026nbspand the ego: your own innate understanding of yourself. Are we swayed so much by what others call us? Probably not. Despite my nomadic childhood, my peripatetic young adulthood, my membership of a wider diaspora, angst over love affairs and migrations and appearance and employment, if I’m honest, I’ve always known myself: as impulsive, restless, often inept, but well-intentioned. Despite all the assumptions made in the geographicalreligioussocial “names” I have been given, these qualities best define who I am.\u0026nbspBAME reference the Windrush\u0026nbspgeneration or the recently arrived Somali, or neither, or both?\u0026nbsp(Getty)The journey I have taken to arrive at the roles I currently have – wife, mother, writer, teacher – baffles many people. My first novel (roundly rejected, then published independently) juxtaposes a young woman’s passionate love affair in Mozambique with her arranged marriage in the US. My second, published as my debut by Polygon, follows a widower’s return to India after 30 years in London. My most recent, The Inheritance, features an affair between a young student and an older lecturer, the latter born in Zimbabwe-then-Rhodesia.\u0026nbspAs a writer, if I tap into my experiences of geographical dislocations and multilingual communities, the literary industry and reviewers often locate the story as one of identity crises, of a quest to belong, in which I give “a compelling insight into what it means to be rootless, with characters torn between the culture of their parents and that of the society in which they grew up”. All true. But not the whole story and not a unique story by any means – instead, one that is shared by millions over a shifting, transient world, including readers of fiction. To a lot of us, the mobility and code-switching and reinvention are rather normal. What informs my sense of self? Whom I love, my children, the opinions and advice of the people who are important in my life.BAME at a glanceIt feels churlish to question BAME. But, if identifying a misrepresented or underrepresented minority, then why not just “minority”? The writer and historian Paul Gilroy, in his book There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack, has already queried the “imploded, narcissistic obsession with the minutiae of ethnicity”. Why the splintering and separation? Does the “B” in BAME reference the Windrush generation or the recently arrived Somali, or neither, or both?\u0026nbspAre we in danger of engendering a hierarchy by stealth, so some minorities are considered more “minority” than others? As a “British Asian” (holding a British passport now, I have become one) I cannot claim to have the same experiences and reception as a Briton with Nigerian origins. But I might well share some of her experiences if she is a woman (like me), if she is a writer (like me), or if she is as scared of her teenage daughter as I am.\u0026nbspAnd if we take the “A” – what constitutes a (British) Asian? Not all of us emanate from the Punjab or Gujarat or Bangladesh, or made a prolonged stopover in east Africa. Not all of our parents arrived in the UK in the 1960s or 1970s. Not all of us live in a large, dense community, or speak its language – or even wish to. Not all of us dance bhangra or admire Bollywood. Our families may not all have served in or near the Raj and we may not have a strong memory of or feelings about partition.Man stabs himself in courtroom being found guilty of sexual assaultUniversities to tackle attainment gap between BAME and white students Disappointed? You might well be, so embedded are the discourses surrounding British Asians. A discourse which can blind an “A” in BAME to the heterogeneity and ersity within – and which is perpetuated sometimes by these iniduals themselves. I once watched on television a very well known British Asian comic whose punchline centred on the unlikelihood of finding an Indian at a Catholic school. The laughter from the audience only served to show how little they knew of the millions of Indians who are Catholic. But, more depressingly – neither it seemed, buying into the discourse, did the comic.To note, the aforementioned Jhalak prize\u0026nbspis the Hindi-Urdu word for “glance”. Considering it is open to all BAME writers, the Bs and the MEs alongside the As, perhaps this is not the most inclusive title?\u0026nbspPerhaps rather than trying to solve issues about ersity by making ersity more explicit and more fractured at the expense of cohesion, we should simply acknowledge that it is, frankly, impossible to categorise a creature as self-reflective and self-concerned as a human being.Sheena Kalayil is a senior language tutor at the University Language Centre at the University of Manchester.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia.

They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesGreg Rutherford after his last ever long jump competition as a professional athlete during the Great City Games in Gateshead.

Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/17/fiat-factory.jpg","title":"stockpiling no deal brexit boost uk economy recession cebr research","story":"Created with Sketch.Businesses will run down stocks of imports built up before EU departure, leading to small contraction of economy, says CEBRClick to followThe IndependentMore disruption is likely to be associated with imports of raw materials for manufacturing than with food and medicinesStockpiling supplies of food and medicine to prepare for the UK crashing out of the EU without a trade deal may boost GDP in the short term but it makes a mini recession after Brexit “almost inevitable”, according to new research.The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said\u0026nbspoutput could rise by 0.5 per cent because of the extra activity associated with building up supplies.However, businesses are then likely to run down inventories in the months after Brexit, leading to a contraction in the economy, CEBR executive director\u0026nbspProfessor Douglas\u0026nbspMcWilliams said.The government papers on the impact of a no-deal Brexit have highlighted the potential disruption – difficulties in obtaining medicines, sandwich ingredients and various other products.\u0026nbspHowever,\u0026nbspthe single largest cause of disruption will be raw materials and semi-manufactures, which account for £100bn of the UK’s\u0026nbsp£260bn of annual imports from the EU, Mr McWilliams said in a note.Assuming that companies will want to stock an additional three months’ worth of raw materials and semi-manufactures imported from the EU and an additional month’s worth of supplies of finished manufactures would imply additional imports of £38bn, a little\u0026nbspless than 2 per cent of annual GDP.\u0026nbspAccording to the research, production and processing of these additional imports will add about £10bn to GDP.“There is some evidence that a rise in inventories is already happening (eg the rise in inventories in Q2 2018 was greater than the rise in GDP), though it is not necessarily Brexit related,” the CEBR said.“Our rough calculation is that GDP will be boosted by 0.5 per cent on average above the underlying trend in the three quarters from July 2018 to March 2019. And that it will be reduced by an equivalent amount for the rest of 2019. This makes a post-Brexit mini recession almost inevitable.”The organisation added that the estimates have to be based on “anecdotal evidence, surveys and intuition” because it is hard to find an equivalent episode to Brexit for comparison.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/09/19/to-let-house.jpg","title":"government slum conditions private renters housing review","story":"Created with Sketch.Experts say \u0027property MOT\u0027 should be imposed on landlords to make sure homes are up to scratch\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentThe government has been urged to tackle “slum” conditions in England’s\u0026nbspprivate rental\u0026nbspsector, as a\u0026nbspreport warns\u0026nbspone in three of the cheapest homes on\u0026nbspthe market\u0026nbspare failing\u0026nbspto meet decent\u0026nbspstandards.The housing experts behind the major new study said\u0026nbspMOT-style tests\u0026nbspshould\u0026nbspbe imposed on landlords to make sure\u0026nbsptheir properties\u0026nbspare fit for habitation.Operating in a similar way to cars, homes would have to undergo an annual inspection.Changes to the welfare system have pushed more and more people into\u0026nbsp“slum tenure” in the private rented sector, according to the\u0026nbspUniversity of York\u0026nbspacademics who conducted the review.But their report, released\u0026nbsptoday, reveals poor housing conditions are a problem at both ends of the private rental market in England.Low-income tenants face ‘heat, eat or pay rent’ choices, warns reportOne in 10 letting agents refuse to rent to families on housing benefitTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesLondon rents rise for first time in two years as UK growth slowsOne in three homes in the cheapest 20 per cent of the sector did not meet the government’s Decent Homes Standard.And one in five properties let in the most expensive 20 per cent of the sector were also considered “non-decent”.Stock condition was found to be worst in the West Midlands, where 40 per cent of private lets were deemed “non-decent”.More than 1.3 million homes rented from private landlords failed to meet the national Decent Homes Standard.Conditions were found to get worse the longer tenants remained in their property, suggesting poor property management rather than old housing stock was the cause of despair.Julie\u0026nbspRugg, co-author of the report, said a “property MOT” test could be conducted by independent inspectors and would be a tax-deductible business cost for landlords.“A property MOT would give people confidence before they sign a tenancy that the property is fit for purpose, and that standards won’t lapse in the future, while for landlords, it offers greater clarity and protection against prosecution,” she said.“We need to see a fundamental rethink of the role that private renting plays in our housing market and a comprehensive strategy to ensure it meets the needs of every renter.”UK news in picturesSir Mo Farah winning the The Great North Run\u0027s elite men\u0027s race, claiming a record-breaking fifth consecutive victory.

When we do a deal, we go back to the members and have to get their approval.\u0026nbsp“Whether it’s through a general election or\u0026nbspa popular vote, Ms May should take her deal on the terms of Brexit and put it back to the people, so the people can decide whether that deal is good enough.”Demanding the prime minister adopt a softer stance and keep Britain closely tied to the EU, Ms O’Grady said: “No deal would be devastating for working people, but so would the prime minister’s proposals.\u0026nbsp“And if Theresa May takes a ‘my deal or no deal’ approach, she won’t be giving parliament a real choice.“She is holding the country to ransom, and no one voted for that. So today I want to give the prime minister fair warning.

Where is the voice of workers?”She was speaking after the TUC’s general council\u0026nbspagreed a lengthy statement outlining its position on Brexit.The council said: “In the face of so much instability and mistrust in the ability of politicians to deliver, it comes as no surprise that polls show a growing number of people want a say on the Brexit deal.“Given the real risk of a collapse in the talks, or a deal that does not deliver on the TUC’s priorities, whilst respecting the result of the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union\u0026nbspwe do not rule out the possibility of campaigning for people to have a Final Say on the Brexit deal through a popular vote.”On Monday, union members at the conference will vote on a motion\u0026nbspcalling for a Final Say vote regardless of the deal Ms May brings back from Brussels.The draft text, tabled by the transport workers union TSSA, calls on the TUC “to campaign for ordinary people to have a Final Say through a referendum on any Brexit deal agreed so that people can make an informed decision on the deal on offer”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/08/00/sophie-walker.jpg","title":"final say womens equality party sophie walker peoples vote second referendum","story":"Created with Sketch.‘The government is expecting women to drop out of work to prop up a\u0026nbspbad deal.

The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU“Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU,” Mr Weber said in a statement on social media.“Today is about the self-assertion of Europe and the defence of our values, because we are being challenged from the outside and the inside. It’s about the survival of our European way of life.“We cannot go on as we are now in the EU. I will help bring Europe back to the people and re-establish the bond between citizens and the European Union. I want to kick start a new chapter in the EU.\u0026nbsp“I want to become the EPP\u0027s lead candidate for the 2019 European Elections and be the next President of the European Commission. Europe needs a new beginning and more democracy.”AFPGetty)In recent months Mr Weber has taken a tough rhetorical line on immigration and migration, in an apparent bid to position himself for the role. In January he was forced to apologise for a comment in which he called for a “final solution to the refugee question”.

Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup. The construction sector also bounced back after a weak start to the year,” said Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics.Since July the ONS has been publishing a monthly GDP estimate, replacing it’s traditional quarterly release.The UK’s GDP growth comes in the context of a growing global economy, fuelled by Donald Trump’s tax cuts in the US and a cyclical bounce-back\u0026nbspin the eurozone.The Bank of England has estimated that the level of the UK’s GDP is still set to be around 2 per cent lower by the end of 2018 than it would have been in the absence of the 2016 Brexit, which pushed up inflation and hit consumption.That translates into a hit of around £900 per UK household.However, the growth recovery this year since the slump to zero in February appears to vindicate the view of the Bank that the weakness in GDP was predominantly due to the snow disruption, rather than an underlying slowdown.“The more timely survey evidence suggests that the economy grew at about 0.4 per cent in August, so the strength of GDP growth seen in July may prove to be fleeting,” said Andrew Wishart\u0026nbspof Capital Economics.“Indeed, the surveys suggest that while the contraction in manufacturing has now come to an end, the sector will continue to lag behind services.”Separately, the ONS reported that the UK trade deficit was £3.4bn in the three months to July, down £1.4bn on the previous quarter.Exports rose 3.3 per cent, outstripping the 2.4 per cent increase in imports.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/09/15/cortlandt-1.jpg","title":"new york subway 911 cortlandt street","story":"Created with Sketch.‘WTC\u0026nbspCortlandt\u0026nbspis more than a new subway station – it is symbolic of New Yorkers’ resolve in restoring and substantially improving the entire World Trade Centre\u0026nbspsite’Click to followThe Independent USThe station was reopened days before the 17th anniversary of the attacksAfter almost two decades out of action, a New York City subway station destroyed in the 911 terrorist attacks has reopened.Situated in the shadow\u0026nbspof the World Trade Centre, Cortlandt Street was completely buried under the rubble when the Twin Towers were hit in 2001. Parts of the building were said to have torn through the terminal – pictures taken after the attack show the station buried under debris and its metal beams nearly bent in two.But just days before the 17th\u0026nbspanniversary of the 911 attacks, the first train in years entered the uncharacteristically gleaming subway station. Unlike much of New York’s underground network, which is renowned for its griminess, the station is air conditioned to keep passengers\u0026nbspcool, with The New York Times describing it as “sleek, bright and airy”, bearing “little resemblance to its old, dank self”.The project began in 2015, delayed due to the lengthy works required to renovate the surrounding area. Its complexity meant transport officials had\u0026nbspto wait for other authorities to decide where new buildings would be before they could plan subway entrances, and saw the cost balloon from $69m (£53.4m) to $158m (£122m).However, it represents\u0026nbspa morale boost for New Yorkers still dealing with the legacy of the terrorist attack, with dozens\u0026nbspturning out on the day to show their appreciation.“I ride the whole subway system and the 1 and 5 lines are my favourites.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"royal","story":"MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry have hinted at their future roles in the Royal Family by...PRINCE George headed back to school this week to begin his second year at the private...THE Duchess of Sussex opened up about her break up with Prince William when she was at...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry shared a tender moment with each other as the Duke of Sussex...PRINCE HARRY and wife Meghan Markle will be making their first royal tour this year, travelling...EVERYBODY remembers where they were when Princess Diana died 21 years ago today and scientists...PRINCE William and Harry will mourn the anniversary of their mother Princess Diana’s death in...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry arrived at the London’s Victoria Palace Theatre to attend a...MEGHAN Markle’s upcoming royal tour of Australia and New Zealand with Prince Harry will be “a...PRINCE Philip was “powerless” to stop the changes to his life when he married the future Queen..."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/1014577_1.jpg","title":"meghan markle mother doria ragland travel uk thomas markle ","story":"Mr Markle is believed to have caused the Duchess of Sussex great distress after a series of media interviews since the Royal Wedding in which he criticised the Royal Family and his son-in-law, Prince Harry.The unexpected visit by Ms Ragland, which is thought to have taken place in July, is said to have seen the American stay with her daughter and Prince Harry at their home in Oxfordshire.A source told the Mail on Sunday: The visit was totally under the radar.\u0026ldquoDoria supported Meghan throughout a lot of the ordeal with Thomas.

The stitch-up reeked.When MEPs found out, even the European parliament was appalled.The improper manoeuvre will keep Selmayr, a devout federalist, at the centre of power for years to come and long after his patron Jean-Claude Juncker has retired to spend more time with his wine cellar.How did they pull it off?The outgoing secretary-general had told Juncker, privately, he would retire this year.Armed with Juncker’s inside knowledge, Selmayr successfully applied to be deputy.Then, at a meeting of commissioners, Juncker revealed the secretary-general post was suddenly vacant and that, as luck would have it, Selmayr was ready to fill it.The ombudsman’s conclusions on what the pair did are scathing. Four serious breaches of protocol and maladministration are listed.Selmayr did not take appropriate measures to avoid conflict of interest. The rules of procedure were broken.“A situation of urgency to fill the post of secretary-general was created artificially,” O’Reilly says, and: “The commissioners  responsible for the maladministration in this case. It is extraordinary that no commissioner seemed to question the secretary-general appointment procedure, which in the end raised valid widespread concerns.”Extraordinary is putting it mildly.The report makes for shocking, if not surprising, reading. The rules-based Brussels order and its highly paid apparat behave like a gangster racket.Just to be helpful, I’m going to send a copy of O’Reilly’s report to every EU flag-waving “People’s Vote” campaigner and to Gary Lineker, the crisp- toting TV football host, who has emerged as a leading voice in the campaign for a second referendum.Needless to say, Selmayr and Juncker face no sanctions or punishment.Instead, O’Reilly recommends that the commission should develop a new procedure — I’m sure that will help — for appointing the next secretary-general.My first thought on reading her report was that the commission is an even more appalling and arrogant organisation than it looks, sitting at the heart of an imperious EU wedded to ever-closer integration.Thank goodness we’re leaving. But are we?To listen to the hysterical wailing of the People’s Vote crowd in recent weeks, you would think that Brexit is about to be stopped and a grateful public will beg to be bossed around by Selmayr and his goons for years to come.There isn’t the parliamentary time for another referendum before we leave on March 29 and it’s an exceptionally duff idea regardless.If there can be two referendums, why leave it at that? Why not make it best of three or five? The decision to leave has been taken. Britain is quitting the EU.Thank goodness, in my view a shame, in the view of others — what matters now are the terms.Here, the Tory party is engaged in a row with itself over the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal, which envisages Britain sticking with the EU’s rule book on goods.It is astonishing to see how purist this has made some of my fellow-Brexiteers who spent years before the referendum acknowledging in private that there would have to be compromises.Not long ago, Boris Johnson was so torn by the nuanced arguments on either side that he plumped for Leave by the narrowest of margins. Now he plays the zealot.But contrary to the prophets of doom, the Chequers proposal isn’t dead yet.No10 is adamant that it has “unlocked the talks” and that, beneath the rhetoric of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, progress is being made that may become apparent at the Salzburg meeting of EU leaders on September 20.In a weird way it might work. With Theresa May’s internal critics split and producing almost as many alternative Brexit plans as there are Tory MPs, Labour divided, and other EU member states anxious that we don’t leave without a deal, something like the Chequers plan remains the best one on offer.It would satisfy non-obsessives like me to just agree a deal, improve it as we go along, and get on with life beyond Brexit. Life is full of compromises.This is sacrilege to my purist friends. But soon, hardline Conservative MPs must decide whether they care so much about ideology that they are prepared to vote down an imperfect deal.If they do that, they risk losing the lot.And by opening the way to emergency extensions of our membership until we come up with another plan, they could condemn Britain to staying in the awful organisation that elevated Martin Selmayr to power.Times/News SyndicationOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until they are, firms enjoying effective monopolies should expect far greater Government scrutiny and action than those who genuinely compete.“We’re in a different age now,” Mr Clark says. Good.CORBYN’S Labour hope to sneak into power on a pack of lies.It’s not just that their economics are a fantasy that would plunge us into ­poverty. Look at their other positions:Corbyn and his No2 John McDonnell both now admit they would never use our nukes, even under attack. A Corbyn Britain would thus abandon our deterrent, whatever Labour’s manifesto says.Will they ever be honest enough to tell voters they would unilaterally disarm, just as the world gets more dangerous?Honesty, though, is not their strong suit.Yesterday McDonnell repeated the absurd lie that he only wanted “peace” in Northern Ireland. He and Corbyn wanted IRA victory, achieved through ­murder. McDonnell wanted Provos “honoured”. He praised them for bombing their way to the negotiating table.As for the anti-Semite Corbyn, how chuffed he must be that 40 per cent of Jews could flee Britain if he wins power. How proud that Corbynite racists plaster Jew-hating posters across London.It’s what happens when you campaign, as Corbyn did, for the right to be more racist towards Jews than the international anti-Semitism definitions allow.And then there’s Brexit, and the insanely dangerous second referendum he seems increasingly ready to back.But at least Leavers would then know who betrayed them. And who to blame for the years of unrest inevitable in telling a 17million majority their vote didn’t count.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many of them need to listen to Sir Christopher Meyer, a former Remainer who is now looking forward to a brighter future free of the EU’s iron grip.It is crucial that everybody involved in these next vital months of negotiations is genuinely ambitious about what Britain can be as a truly independent country.We have the fifth-largest economy in the world and we’re a “soft-power” titan.There might be people in Brussels who think we are doomed to failure once we leave — but there shouldn’t be any ­sitting on our side of the table.If the Government prepares us properly for a clean break over the coming months, we’ve no reason to be scared for the future.

They should have the Government’s unquestioned backing when former partners leech on their child support obligations.The reasoning behind this decision might appear obvious on a spreadsheet that shows the cost of pursuing old cases isn’t worth the hassle.But you try telling that to a mum or dad trying to make ends meet.How civil servants managed to botch the administration of this scheme is an important question, but for another time.Right now the Government need to stick by people who need their support.The agency was closed in 2012 with arrears topping £3.7 billion - £2.5 billion to parents and just over £1 billion to the taxpayer.Since 2012 legacy cases have been pursued as “resources allow”.One Mum, Joanna Archer said: “The Government is planning to write-off £2.5 billion of arrears that isn’t even owed to them.“They claim that the records cost too much to archive and are in any case inaccurate.

He hated every minute of it.”Now 73, and still living in the house in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, she shared with Park, Jennie refuses to speak publicly about the case.Rachel and Jeremy, who once described his dad as a “big softie”, will not comment until their final appeal bid has run its course.Victim Carol’s side of the family were convinced the jury got it right when they found him guilty in 2005.Niece Kay Washford, 56, said yesterday: “If he was innocent he would have fought it and fought it.“His suicide absolutely seemed like an admission of guilt to us.“I’m not happy about this latest attempt at an appeal. What do they think they have found that would make a difference?“Nothing has changed in our minds. We remain convinced that the police got the right man. And we will carry on fighting for Carol. It doesn’t matter how long she has been gone. She was part of our family and she deserves justice.”Carol, 30, was killed with an ice axe, her body wrapped in plastic sheeting and dumped in Coniston Water in the Lake District.The ropes used to tie Carol’s body are central to the case, with Jeremy and Rachel hoping advances in technology will detect another person’s DNA on the knots or plastic wrapping.That could lead to a full appeal and, ultimately, the conviction being quashed.Any appeal would be a startling development in a story which began more than half a century ago, when Carol and Park were introduced by a mutual friend.It did not take long for Carol, then a teenager and town hall clerk, and Gordon, aged around 20 and working at his parents’ paint and wallpaper business, to fall in love.Their romance would repeatedly give way to rows and break-ups but they always got back together and, in 1967, became man and wife.They moved into Bluestones, a house which Park was building in the pretty village of Leece, near Barrow-in- Furness, Cumbria.It was there, according to police, where he would murder Carol nine years later in a fit of jealous rage.The family had already been shattered by one violent death when, in 1969, Carol’s sister Christine was throttled by her boyfriend, who was later jailed for life.Christine, 17, had a young daughter Vanessa, who Carol and Park agreed to adopt and bring up as their own.They went on to have Jeremy and Rachel but the demands of caring for three children put more strain on their worsening relationship.Park was so strict with his kids that he used an egg-timer to make sure they ate their vegetables quickly, cracking a cane on the table if they failed.With their rows becoming increasingly heated, Carol, a primary school teacher like her husband, felt trapped by his controlling nature and embarked on the first of a series of flings.She twice left home for other men but returned, unable to be without her children.At the height of the summer of 1976 the couple decided to take Vanessa, eight, Jeremy, six, and Rachel, five, to Blackpool for the day.Park later told police that on the morning of the July trip, Carol said she felt unwell and stayed at home.He said he took the kids on his own and that Carol had vanished by the time they got home that night.Strangely, he did not report her missing for six weeks.He would go on to say: “I expected that she had gone off with somebody else. She had done it several times before.I was not unduly worried. She was young, attractive, vivacious and quite capable of looking after herself.”AT Park’s trial, prosecutors admitted there was not one conclusive piece of evidence – such as DNA or CCTV – which convicted him.Rather there was a collection of circumstantial evidence which “points one way – that Park killed his wife”.This included tensions in the marriage. A friend once called at their house to help defuse a row and found Park sitting on Carol, pinning her to the floor.Prosecutors also had the statement of a tourist who was at the lake in July 1976 and remembered seeing a man matching Park’s description dropping a “bulky item” into the water.Carol’s body was trussed up with rope tied with knots used by sailors and climbers. Park was both, and ropes found at his home had expertly tied knots like those used to tie up Carol.A hammer was also found and had imprints on it matching marks on the flattened lead piping used to weigh down her body.Stones recovered from the lake bed near her body matched those found in walls at the couple’s home.While on remand after his first arrest, two prisoners claimed that Park admitted the murder to them.His delay in raising the alarm made detectives suspicious and they carefully searched the house, including the chest freezer in the garage, and questioned the children.Park was not arrested and the first investigation ran out of steam after six months.But the police let it be known that if her body was ever found, Park, who kept a boat called Sail Fish on Coniston Water, would be the prime suspect.That became a reality 21 years later, when members of the Kendal and Lakes Diving Club were exploring the lake bed at a remote spot 250 yards off Bailiff Wood, on the east side of the five-and-a-half-mile stretch of water.At first they thought they had found an outboard motor so did not bother to collect it until three days later.When they eventually brought it ashore in August 1997 they discovered it was a body.One of the divers, John Walsh, said shortly after the find: “We became suspicious when we had a better look after dragging it ashore.“Cord was tied all around and it had been deliberately weighted down. But it still came as a nasty shock when we were told we had discovered a body.“I hope I never see anything like it again.”Carol was found dressed in a blue baby-doll nightdress.Within days, dental checks identified the remains.Park was on holiday in France at the time with childhood sweetheart Jennie.She had become his wife four years earlier, after the end of his short-lived marriage to second wife Catherine Sillars.Park and Catherine tied the knot in 1981, two years after his marriage to Carol was officially dissolved while she was still a missing person.Park, who continued to be a keen sailor and had a 19ft yacht called Mrs J, was arrested on his return to England and charged with Carol’s murder.But prosecutors announced five months later that there was not enough evidence to proceed with the case.FROM the day Carol vanished to the day he killed himself 34 years later, Park never wavered from his story.He claimed she was alive when he and the children went to Blackpool for a day out and was gone when they returned home.Park thought she had gone off with a lover and although he never publicly pointed the finger, one of her former partners – who was never a suspect – claimed Park had tried to implicate him in her disappearance.By the time anyone knew Carol had been murdered – when her body was found in 1997 – his children were adults and he had been married to third wife Jennie for four years.They had only ever known him as a decent, law-abiding father and husband and had no reason to suspect he was capable of murder.With no compelling evidence to prove he was the killer, they have continued to support his innocence.Park was delighted to be released, urging the police not to give up the hunt for his former wife’s killer.He said after the news in 1998: “I did not kill Carol — and I want people to know the truth. I want to put the record straight and draw a line under these terrible events I want her murderer caught.After all I’ve been through, the police owe it to me.”Detectives never did give up the hunt and, whether Park knew it or not, he remained their prime suspect.In January 2004 he was arrested again and once more charged with her murder.The following year, after what was effectively the third investigation into Carol’s death, the case went to trial at Manchester Crown Court.The jury heard that stones found where Carol’s body had been dumped matched ones taken from the walls at the family home.The body had been tied with a series of intricate knots and Park was said to have knowledge of ropes and knots thanks to his love of sailing.He denied murder but was found guilty and jailed for life.The rift that has opened up between Carol’s family, Jeremy and Rachel since his suicide at HMP Garth, near Leyland, Lancs, in January 2010, is just another tragic aspect to a story that has so far refused to end.Will the final chapter see Park’s kids clear their dad’s name?GOT a story?

Henry McMaster said: Pretend, assume, presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina and is going to go way inshore.The states emergency management agency said it is preparing for the possibility of a large-scale disaster.In Charleston, South Carolina, along the coast, city officials offered sandbags to residents.Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune urged people to secure their homes but said its too early to know if evacuations will be ordered.Hardware stores and supermarkets were busy ringing up sales of bottled water, plywood and generators.Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News: Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water.Theyre coming in and buying water and plates, and thats about all theyre buying.North Carolina officials started getting bulldozers and chain saws ready.Across the south east, people were urged to put together emergency supply kits, prepare their homes and research evacuation routes.The Navy planned to send ships from the Hampton Roads area of Virginia out to sea.Florida-based Carnival Cruise Line re-routed its cruise ships."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000432075457.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pac man clean up ocean","story":"On Saturday, the £20m ocean-cleaning device headed from San Francisco Bay to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - which now covers an area the size of France - located between Hawaii and California.System 001, developed by non-profit organisation Ocean Cleanup, consists of a 600-metre-long floater that sits at the surface of the water and a tapered 3-metre-deep skirt attached below.The tube is shaped into a horseshoe and will drift naturally with the currents and the winds. Because it will move faster than the bits of plastic in the water it will gather them into a small area. The trapped debris will be collected by a vessel every few months and taken to land to be recycled.It is designed to collect larger debris to stop it from breaking down in dangerous microplastics.The pioneering system has built in lanterns, radar reflectors, navigational signals, GPS, and anti-collision beacons. Solar panels help provide power the the systems.Dutch innovator Boyan Slat said his device is the best way to clean up the ocean todayIt took five years to design and was invented by 24-year-old Dutch innovator Boyan Slat who hopes it will fetch 80,000 tons of plastic in its first year. If successful, more systems will be rolled out to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch where it is estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic weighing 80,000 metric tons are currently afloat.But the pac-man has received heavy criticism from members of the marine community who believe the device will not reach the tiny pieces of plastic which will sink to the bottom of the ocean. What’s more, while the system is designed for fish to go underneath, there are concerns creatures such as jellyfish which float on the water’s surface could get trapped in the device.But Dutch inventor Boyan Slat hit back at the criticism, saying: “I don’t think there’s much of a choice in what we’re trying to do.“Research shows the plastic doesn’t go away by itself and keeps fragmenting over the next few decades. If we don’t clean it up now, all of it will become micro plastics and then we are in a much worse state than we are today.“This is the best way we could figure out how to do it.“If there are better ways, we’d love to know.”If successful, The Ocean Cleanup project is pressing on with its plans and believes it could remove 90 per cent of ocean plastic by 2040.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not to mention the shameless snooping on the family of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. So trade union leaders in Manchester this week and Labour figures such as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who champions the unlawfully blacklisted, are entitled to be furious. Four years ago Theresa May announced an inquiry into undercover policing but it is progressing at a snail’s pace.  This is the establishment’s way of fighting back to keep its dirty secrets. Heading the inquiry is retired judge and member of London’s exclusive men-only Garrick Club Sir John Mitting, 70, who concedes he may be a little old-fashioned. He lost the victims’ confidence long ago. He was pilloried as an out of touch “white, upper middle class, elderly gentleman” by their lawyer during a dramatic walkout. The treatment of women like Jessica, who claims she was deceived by undercover detectives living secret double lives, was one of the worst abuses in Scotland Yard’s history. For her the inquiry is not bringing justice. Jessica, the name she uses to protect her privacy, is suing the police.

Seven-year-old Jenson Lindop Lamens\u0027 frustrated parents, Richard and Jenny, took him out of school in December because they say he was not receiving the help he needs. He requires specialist signing and bilingual help but he was becoming increasingly upset at not being able to communicate with his teachers or friends. But fast forward eight months and he has still not been given a place. His family have accused Cheshire East Council for failing to complete vital paperwork that stopped them getting a new school place for Jenson. The local authority is legally required to keep an up-to-date ‘manual’ of the education and health care requirements for every special needs child. Richard and Jenny say this has not been updated since December 2015 and therefore doesn’t include a later review which stated he needs sign language support. They claim that stopped a school just four miles from his old one taking Jenson on because they needed to see evidence in his plan that he needs British Sign Language support.  Jenny told the Crewe Chronicle : “The paperwork from the meeting last September, where it was agreed that Jenson would be entitled to full-time one-to-one signing support, seems to have mysteriously gone missing.   So that information is not going to be put into his plan because, according to Cheshire East, it doesn’t exist. “But it does exist. We’ve got emails from his old school to say that they were trying to put it in place because of the meeting, but Cheshire East are just refusing to put it in his EHCP  because apparently they don’t have any evidence he needs to sign.” She added: “The school can’t accept him until his paperwork says this child needs this. If I consult with another school they’re going to say exactly the same to me and its not because that school is not appropriate for Jenson, it’s because his paperwork doesn’t reflect the child that he is.”  Jenson suffered brain damage and hearing loss when he contracted meningitis when he was just 16 months old.  Jenny also claims the local authority made no contact despite Jenson being taken out school. She said: “We took him out of school without one single email or phone call from Cheshire East to say ‘why’s your son out of education?\u0027 “I reported myself to child welfare in March to say, ‘can you please come and prosecute me or do something because my child’s out of education and Cheshire East won’t do anything’. “I don’t think it should take three months for somebody to chase up the safety and welfare of a child.” "},{"url":null,"title":"diana marriage letters philip prince","story":"NewsDiana\u0027s letters from Prince Philip reveal he and the Queen \u0027never dreamed\u0027 Charles would leave her for Camilla\"I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind would leave you for Camilla\"Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByBronwen Weatherby22:46, 8 SEP 2018Updated09:35, 10 SEP 2018NewsPrincess Of Wales, the People\u0027s Princess was loved by a nation but not by her husband Charles \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Charles and Princess Diana\u0027s split 26 years ago shocked the world. It is believed that the Queen wrote to the unhappy married couple to recommend they divorce. But Prince Philip openly took his daughter-in-law\u0027s side when things got messy between her and Charles, and unearthed correspondence between himself and Diana show what he really thought of his son divorcing the People\u0027s Princess. In a letter written in 1992, Philip told Diana of his and the Queen\u0027s disapproval of their son\u0027s love life, RSVP live reports .  The unearthed letters, set out Philip\u0027s disapproval of his son\u0027s love life, calling him silly for risking everything with Camilla for a man in his position. Signed lovingly with fondest love, Pa, Philip wrote: We never dreamed he might feel like leaving you for her. I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind would leave you for Camilla. Such a prospect never even entered our heads. Philip also expressed his sympathy and support to Diana and offered to become a mediator in the war that raged on between her and her estranged husband Charles.  He mentioned in the letter: I can only repeat what I’ve said before, if invited, I will always do my utmost to help you and Charles to the best of my ability. But I am quite ready to concede that I have no talent as a marriage counsellor. Diana confided in her private secretary at the time Patrick Jephson, who said the support of her in-laws had meant a lot to her. Patrick said: Here at last was written proof that this was acknowledged, recognised, and there was sympathy for her. Although Philip was sympathetic to the situation, he also made it clear to Diana that he would not support her having new romantic relationships.  He wrote: We do not approve of either of you having lovers. He also said Diana was partly to blame for the breakdown of her and Charles\u0027 marriage. Can you honestly look into your heart and say that Charles\u0027s relationship with Camilla had nothing to do with your behaviour towards him in your marriage?” he added.  Details of Charles and Diana\u0027s rocky marriage was revealed to the public for the first time during the period these letters were written. And in 1992, a number of royal scandals took place, keeping the family in the public eye for the rest of the year. In March of that year, Prince Andrew and Sarah \u0027Fergie\u0027 Ferguson separated, and a couple of months later Fergie was photographed sucking American tycoon John Bryan\u0027s toes while on holiday.  In April, Princess Anne announced that she would be divorcing Captain Mark Phillips. And if all of this wasn\u0027t dramatic enough, intimate telephone conversations between Princess Diana and close friend James Gibney were leaked and published by The Sun. In the private phonecalls, Diana suggested to James that her situation with Charles and Camilla was like something that would happen to a character in EastEnders.

Charlton Taylor plays a key role in the high street chain’s pre-Christmas campaign, showing a school production of Queen song Bohemian Rhapsody. The nine-year-old emerges from a box to sing a line in the ad, which made its debut during Great British Bake Off last Tuesday on Channel 4. But as mum Sonia Fleming watches Charlton with pride, she is devastated that his dad, Royal Marine Lance Corporal Michael Taylor, cannot.  Sonia, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, said: “Michael didn’t sing or dance, he was shy like me, so I have no idea where \u0026shyCharlton’s talent comes from. “But Michael would have been so proud. He does ask about his dad a lot, it is hard because he has no memory of him.” Michael was serving with Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, when he was killed in a gun battle in the Sangin district of Helmand province in June 2010, aged 30. Charlton was just 10 months old and his brothers Ethan and Wesley were 13 and 11.  Sonia, 38, said: “It’s heartbreaking he never got to know his great dad like the others did but me and his older brothers tell him all about Michael. “We also set up the Rhyl Commandos Junior Football Club in Michael’s memory and Charlton watches the match every Sunday. “And every year, around the time of Michael’s anniversary, some of his friends from the Marines come down and have a game. Then they all tell Charlton stories about his dad.” Charlton, who dances at a local stage school, already has an agent – who landed him a part in the John Lewis advert, filmed at a school in London.  Sonia said: “It was amazing to see Charlton in the advert. We had to wait like everyone else to see what it was going to be like.” To promote its new black logo and company name John Lewis \u0026amp Partners, the high street chain has created its biggest marketing campaign to date outside the festive season.

The mother of seven, who now goes under a new identity, was alone as she left the shop wearing a checked top and clutching a carrier bag, with a SuperDry satchel over her shoulder. Matthews was jailed for eight years in 2008 after being found guilty of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting justice.

Innocent Shannon – who is 20 on Sunday – vanished in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks, prompting a month-long police search.

The 17-year-old didn’t know if he could carry on – not only with the surgery but with life itself. For all his young life Rory had put up with being called “freak” and “alien”. The constant insults had become so bad that in his darkest hour he thought dying on the operating table would not be the worst thing that could happen. Rory, now 24, described that shocking moment. He says: “I felt so low at that point I thought if I died, all the mental pain I’d had to endure would be over. “For someone at 17 years old that’s obviously an awful way to be thinking. I was told I was a freak. I was compared to an alien. I don’t think people realise how much that can get to someone, especially a young boy.” Rory, from Ayr in west Scotland, is recalling that time to remind bullies of the harm they inflict and, importantly, to assure others in his situation that there is always hope.  With astonishing resilience and strength, and the support of friends and family, Rory endured 20 operations. But, most bravely of all, he is \u0026shyovercoming those who mocked him by campaigning for more awareness of the effects of bullying, educating on discrimination and inspiring others. He is highlighting the prejudice he has faced by fronting the Changing Faces Hate Crime Campaign. Rory is working with the police to raise awareness of how people with \u0026shydisfigurements are protected by UK hate crime law. Now he has been \u0026shyshortlisted for Young Upstander at the No2H8Crime Awards. Thursday’s awards ceremony, hosted by TV presenter and social commentator June Sarpong MBE, is held to reward people and organisations which have been exceptional in fighting hate crime.  For Rory, born with a venous malformation on his lip, caused by abnormally formed veins that can enlarge as the body grows, it is a \u0026shybrilliant platform to highlight again how devastating hate can be. He says: “I haven’t had it easy over the past few years, juggling lots of \u0026shyoperations with having to deal with ignorance and prejudice because I look a little different. “The mental side of the abuse I had to face really halted my \u0026shydevelopment from a teenager into a young man. On the morning of my 21st birthday I spent around two hours crying. “Because it is seen as a big milestone age that is normally celebrated in a big way. But, instead, I was upset I had reached that age and was still having to go through prejudice. “I didn’t have the confidence to go out. If I did go out, I’d experience prejudice and that would make me feel really bad about myself. It was really hard to deal with the constant staring from people of all ages. But now I’m at the point where I accept what I look like. “I’m trying to teach people that no matter what you look like you shouldn’t put anyone through any sort of prejudice.” A big part of his acceptance has come from wanting to educate those who tormented him, rather than seeking revenge.  He says: “I’d try to educate them, to make them see the error of their ways. I’d tell them what they did to me really, really hurt me.” Now, alongside his campaign work, Rory lives a full life, working for a medical \u0026shyinsurance company, as well as enjoying his passion for golf. He also has a supportive girlfriend, Isabel, 20, who will be attending the awards with him. He says: “I’m really excited and overwhelmed to be shortlisted. “I’ve had a look at the other people who are up for nominations and they’re all so inspirational. They do such great work that I’m just happy to be mentioned in the same sentence as them.

Analysis by researchers at Ohio University, US, has shown religious people live about four years longer than agnostics and atheists.  After analysing more than 1,500 obituaries from across the US, the team, including an associate professor of psychology, Christian End, concluded the difference between worshippers and those who weren’t part of a religious group could be  down to a mix of social support, stress-relieving practices and abstaining from unhealthy habits.  The records they studied included religious affiliations and marriage details as well as information on \u0026shyactivities, hobbies and habits, which can help or hinder our health, not usually found in census data.  The study found that, on average, people whose obituary mentioned they were religious lived an extra 5.64 years. Life expectancy was 3.82 years longer in religious people when they took into consideration marriage rates, a factor which has been shown to increase life expectancy and help stave off disease. “The study provides persuasive evidence there is a relationship between religious participation and how long a person lives,” said Dr Baldwin Way, co-author of the study and \u0026shyassociate professor of psychology. The major part of the study used more than 1,000 obituaries from \u0026shynewspapers in 42 states. But a further analysis of 500 obituaries from the Des Moines Register, a newspaper in Iowa, US, found the effect was more pronounced and religion was \u0026shyassociated with an extra 6.48 years of life, suggesting living in a more \u0026shyreligious community might have an extra effect.

Marie Bentley, 58, had worked for a local authority for more than 30 years since leaving school and prided herself on remembering complex information needed for her job. It was when she found she could not recall details of legislation that she first noticed her symptoms.  But after going to see her GP and being sent for a number of tests her life was turned upside down, the Hertfordshire Mercury reports.   She and her husband Mark, who live in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, with their 16-year-old daughter Alex, were given the devastating news that she had been diagnosed with progressive semantic dementia.  It was so unexpected and so very sad, said Mark, recalling the day the couple were given the news in 2014. We were not at all prepared for this diagnosis. We came out of the appointment completely shell-shocked.  Semantic dementia is a form of frontotemporal dementia, or FTD. It is rare, with just 16,000 people in the UK thought to be affected. It is a form of dementia that can often affect younger people, typically in their 40s, 50s and 60s, and its symptoms are progressive. Marie\u0027s GP initially thought her symptoms might be as a result of stress and signed her off work for two weeks, the Hertfordshire Mercrury reports. When he reviewed her two weeks later, he recommended a further two weeks off work and in the meantime arranged for a home assessment team to visit her. He must have suspected she had dementia, but he was not explicit about this to Marie and her family at the time, according to the report.  She was then referred to The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London, a leading centre for diseases of the brain, spine and nervous system.  Mark attended the appointment with Marie, which involved numerous tests over the course of a day. Two weeks later they returned to the hospital where they were given the news of Marie\u0027s diagnosis. No treatment or cure is available for the condition and Marie was advised not to return to work as stress could accelerate the degeneration of her brain. Despite taking early retirement, Marie stays in regular contact with her colleagues, as well as staying active, going to the gym and taking long walks with friends.  “Marie keeps herself busy. She might spend a bit more time doing things like the family food shopping, making sure that she can describe the things she needs to buy if the words escape her, said Mark. She gets by and her independence is important to her. Early signs of the disease are quite subtle, such as difficulty finding words and understanding the meaning of words that would have been previously known or forgetting what objects are for. Unlike Alzheimer’s disease, people in the early stages of semantic dementia would not normally have problems with their day-to-day memory or their ability to find their way around. On turning 50, Mark has taken on a series of challenges to raise money for The National Brain Appeal, a charity that raises funds for The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, where Marie was diagnosed and where she is taking part in research. One of these events is the Thames Path Challenge, where Mark will attempt to run 100km in one day. Mark will start the Thames Path Challenge at 8am on Saturday, 8 September, and is hoping to complete the race in around 12 hours. The route starts at Putney Bridge in South West London and follows the River Thames all the way to Henley in Oxfordshire. Mark’s son Tom, who lives in London, will be there to cheer him on. “This is the biggest challenge I have ever taken on, said Mark, a self-employed carpenter. I ran the London Marathon in four and a half hours in 2017 and so far this year I have taken part in a half marathon and a ten kilometre race. He added: 100km is quite a leap but I’m up for giving it a go and have been doing a lot of training for it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"number fat cats paid over","story":"NewsNumber of fat cats paid over £1 million year soars to almost 20,000In total, 18,700 now pocket the huge sum each year with a third living in London, according to a studyShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew GregoryPolitical Editor00:00, 10 SEP 2018NewsThe rich are getting richer, it would seem \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe number of fat cats paid over \u0026pound1million a year has soared to almost 20,000.

Many of the top earners were foreign business executives, investors or non-doms. The report looked at the most recent figures available from 2015/16. It added that overseas investors could be put off settling in the UK if visa rules are tightened after the UK leaves the EU next March.  Tim Fullerlove, Partner at Wilsons, said: “London is still an attractive prospect for the wealthy, but a more welcoming culture in UK policies could help to retain its appeal. “Wealthy business executives, investors and non-doms from overseas are a boon for the UK economy, paying large amounts of taxes in the capital and generating job creation.

Nick Roberts was left with devastating injuries when his parachute became entwined with a friend\u0027s and the pair fell to the ground within seconds. Mr Roberts lay helpless, in pain, on the ground and not knowing how seriously he was injured. His friend was laid near him. He did not survive - and Mr Roberts, 47, was left with lasting injuries. The pair had been motor paragliding with four others over a field in Peterborough on the day of the crash. A witness who was at ground level when the collision occurred called emergency services.  Ambulances arrived soon afterwards, followed by two air ambulances, Lincolnshire Live reported.    Mr Roberts was airlifted to Queen\u0027s Medical Centre in Nottingham and, sadly, his friend died at the scene.  Self-employed builder Mr Roberts had extensive and serious injuries including a broken back, broken ribs, broken knee and an injury to his ankle that was so severe that a bone was sticking out through his skin, leaving doctors questioning if he would survive. He also suffered other multiple injuries. Mr Roberts underwent three days of surgery with six hours spent on cleaning up his ankle. Recalling the day Mr Roberts said: “I turned left when on the paramotor in the sky and he was there in front of me. It happened so fast. I remember thinking ‘this is going to hurt.’  We hit the ground within seconds. I think my feet hit the floor first and I felt my back and legs break. I could hear my friend breathing when we were on the ground and the paramedics came. People are unaware of how important the air ambulance is until they need it. They flew me straight to Nottingham. “I had no idea how serious the injuries were at first. I remember the air ambulance landing but I cannot remember much after that. They told me they couldn’t say if I would be able to walk again but I can walk. It’s small steps at the moment but I am getting there. Mr Roberts spent three weeks in hospital with his family fearing the worst for the first 10 days.  His family had been told he may not survive due to the extent of his injuries. But Mr Roberts is on the mend and is undergoing physiotherapy to aid his walking. Mr Roberts’ wife Jodie, 43, and their four children Jack, 21, Joe, 19, Grace, 15, and Amy, 14 have been supporting him in his rehabilitation. Mrs Roberts said: “It was the bank holiday weekend, when the police came knocking at the door. I’ll never forget it, they said are you the wife of Mr Roberts? I replied ‘yes.’ They said your husband has been involved in a collision and I asked them if it was in the sky or on the ground.

The United Airlines pilot took a rest an hour into the seven hour long trans-Atlantic journey from Newark, New Jersey. Concerned passengers were worried that the pilot\u0027s actions posed a safety risk. The incident happened on flight UA161, which left Liberty International Airport at 7.40pm on August 22 and arrived in Glasgow Airport at 7.30am the next day. The flight was under the control of a three-man cockpit crew.  A retired police inspector who now works as a security adviser took a photo of the captain after he laid out his uniform and nodded off in bed. He told the Daily Record : “The captain went to the loo and changed into a T-shirt before going for a sleep in first class. “When he woke up, he changed back into his uniform and radioed for access back to the cockpit. “Police officers get a hard time when they are photographed sleeping in a patrol car. “I don’t think the captain of a flight packed with hundreds of people should be in such a vulnerable position. “He slept for an hour and a half, then the first officer went for a sleep. The flight was about seven hours. “Surely if pilots are in need of a rest mid-flight, they should do it away from the passengers. I’ve travelled to the US many times and have never witnessed this.” A cabin crew member who works for a major airline, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “This is not a procedure I recognise. “It seems highly unusual for a captain to remove his uniform during a flight.

Joel Leaver worked as a cleaner at the Prestatyn Sands site in Wales from 2013 to 2015 - and describes cleaning sinks \u0027blocked with vomit and towels covered in faeces\u0027 - sometimes with NO gloves. It comes after numerous complaints throughout the summer regarding hygiene standards at the holiday operator\u0027s sites. Just days ago, council chiefs ordered for the pool at the Prestatyn resort to be closed with pictures showing the state it was in before being shut down. Another family claimed their chalet at the same resort in Wales was \u0027like a crack den\u0027 .  Writing for Wales Online , Joel told of how he started as an accommodation assistant or cleaner at the complex when he was 17. Joel worked there during school holidays and odd weekends between 2013 and 2015, originally earning \u0026pound3.72 an hour, which was increased to \u0026pound5.03 when he turned 18. Joel said: In my opinion, the site was out-dated and a little decrepit and needing serious attention. The general feel was that it wasn\u0027t very well looked after, and it seemed like a set from a drama televised decades ago.  Whilst I was employed there, I watched Holiday on the Buses, which was filmed there in the 70s. Some of the bathrooms I was cleaning were identical to those in the film. Rooms appeared to have been left untouched, in some cases, for at least 40 years. Joel said he and his fellow cleaners were fighting an uphill battle every day and had just 20 minutes to clean each chalet. He said: Ovens, for example, were already so dirty that we couldn\u0027t possibly get them looking much better.  We could clean the floor and wipe down surfaces, but that was the extent of our role we glossed over the cracks and problems that were already present. It would take more than some diluted cleaning spray or a mop to fix the major issues. Cleaners at the camp were paired up on most shifts, and it was expected that each chalet would be cleaned within 20 minutes. On average, most chalets included a bathroom, kitchen, big living room space and between one and two bedrooms. Staff were also expected to stock up the chalets with pillows and any missing kitchen utensils as well, and bedding needed to be rolled up neatly. Recalling a particularly gruesome incident, Joel said: One time myself and my partner found a sink blocked with vomit.  As well as time consuming, this is also unacceptable - nobody should be left to clean that up except the person themselves. It was probably one of the many chalets left with cans and bottles scattered all across the floor from yet another group of partying guests. Another time, we turned up to find several towels in the bath that were covered in faeces. I\u0027ll never know what really happened although I had to clean the mess up, gagging during each second of it. There were numerous occasions when gloves would be out of stock - and so we cleaned this sort of thing without them sometimes.  Even though he was 17 and fairly physically fit at the time, Joel said it was hard to get everything done in the allotted time and that it was particularly hard on older staff members. He continued: Most people could easily spend the whole 20 minutes on a bathroom or kitchen, especially if particularly dirty. Cleaners were poorly equipped, lacking the supplies that we needed. Cleaning products were weak, and when we did receive some branded alternatives once, they were scarce and their inclusion didn\u0027t last long.  The vacuum cleaners were outdated, to the extent that they were pretty heavy and fairly useless. I remember at a training session, probably in 2015, I was told that \u0026pound1 million had been made in the last year. Did I see a pay rise because of it? No. Did the site get any major revamp? Absolutely not. This wasn\u0027t a business that was struggling to stay afloat. It was making money, yet the site and staff never reaped any benefits from this.

The royal took the mother of Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt into an emotional embrace when they met last week at a charity concert in London. Hunt, 39, who was part of a desert reconnaissance unit which was involved in identifying roadside bombs planted by the Taliban, was found dead at his home in Lincoln in January. He had been diagnosed with mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder.  Harry, who served alongside Hunt and has been his friend, and Meghan Markle , were visibly moved as they listened to his parents, Derek and Maria, describe how they came to terms with their son\u0027s death.   Harry gave me a bear hug as soon as he saw me, just like Nathan used to do, said Maria, from Lincoln. I’d spent a week practising a little bow for when I met Harry, but he didn’t give me the chance. He just pulled me into his arms. When I looked up, Harry had a tear on his cheek. It was very emotional because he knew my son well. They went through a lot together. He is so warm and caring and so was Meghan. Derek and I are, of course, still grieving for our Nathan, but I really felt that Harry and Meghan appreciated what we’re going through and that meant so much to us.

It starred Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina Spellman - a schoolgirl with special powers who comes from a long line of witches. But many fans felt the real star of the show was her super-sarcastic talking black cat \u0027Salem\u0027. Millions of viewers dreamed of having their very own magical moggie like him. And that was exactly why Sam and his family ended up recently adopting a black cat called Coco from Cat\u0027s Protection. Speaking as part of Purina and Cats Protection\u0027s Unadoptables campaign - which celebrates the fact no cat is unadoptable - Sam explained: My wife Lara had always wanted a black cat.  This came from her childhood love of witches. Her favourite TV show growing up was Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and the witch had a talking black cat as a pet. We could not believe it when Cats Protection told us that many of the cats in their care are actually black, because many people simply don’t want them. This made Lara really sad.  She made up her mind right there that Coco was going to be ours. She even thought about renaming her Salem, after the cat from the TV show! But thankfully, we persuaded her to keep the name Coco. Sadly, many of the cats in care are black. Where it was once superstition and the fear of bad luck, a growing trend to why black cats are often overlooked is because apparently, they don’t photograph well for people’s social feeds. Sam and Lara originally looked into adopting a black kitten for their little girls - but they were just as thrilled when the family found a cat who was a little older.  He explained: The girls weren’t at all sad that she’s not a kitten, they absolutely love her.  The first day we took her home, she vanished. We looked everywhere. I couldn’t believe it when we found her in our girls’ room as they are so noisy and manic.  In the drawers under their bed, I could just see a little bit of fur snuggled amongst the fancy dress.  Coco loves her new home - but Sam reckons he has become her No1.

At just 10-years-old, they have each landed big contracts with Marks \u0026amp Spencer and both are naturals.  But their futures were not always this positive when they were each diagnosed with Down\u0027s Syndrome at birth, their families were terrified.  Cora\u0027s mother was advised to have an abortion because doctors mistakenly thought her baby\u0027s heart and brain were not developing properly.  Lucas was diagnosed with Down\u0027s Syndrome the same week that his brother was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Wales Online reported.  Now fast forward a decade later and they are minor celebrities - juggling their modelling duties alongside going to primary school.  Lucus’s story   Until six-year-old Lucus was born, proud parents Kellie and Dominic Evans had no idea their child would have Down’s Syndrome. No sooner had the family taken home their newborn son than they were faced with another discovery – a week later their older son Alexander was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Since then, however, the two boys have only gone from strength to strength and now hold their own alongside their two sisters modelling for a number of mainstream agencies. “In two weeks I discovered my two boys had disabilities,” saiid Kellie, 40, from Bridgend. “I knew nothing. Where we were living a child paediatrician was leaving and another one was starting and we were in the couple of weeks where there wasn’t one.  “I was at home when Lucus was about seven days old and I remember looking at things online. I phoned the doctors and just said ‘I don’t want to read about the fact that my son might be infertile online, I need someone to sit down with me and tell me’. “When you have a child their future isn’t mapped out, they can do anything. “I remember crying saying to Dominic that Lucus will never be a fireman – I didn’t even want him to be a fireman. “I wasn’t being negative, I was just being a realist.” Kellie said: “She did the sign for Clean Bandit’s Rockabye – I think then she had been learning sign language for about a year. It got 30,000 views. Now she does pop songs and will do her word of the day videos. People will message her through me to say they are learning to talk to their child through it.  “She taught herself and we are learning from her. I can sign ‘I love you’ to Lucus and we’re not disturbing anyone. Lucus loves it, it’s like his secret little language.” So far Lucus has starred in campaigns for the likes of Thomas and Friends and the NSPCC followed by a TV debut on Hollyoaks. He has also been featured on National Trust and Royal Mints adverts alongside brother Alexander, eight, and sisters Isabella, 12, and Indiana, four. For Kellie the decision to use a mainstream agency for all four siblings stemmed from her concerns over pigeonholing children with disabilities. She said: “He loves it. For Lucus as much as he doesn’t talk a lot he is really sociable and as soon as that camera comes out he will start to interact with it.” She added: “Overall people are really positive – so many people tell me how beautiful Lucus is – but there has been the odd one. “You have people staring as they are curious or have a personal story or know someone who is disabled but they are too shy to ask anything. “You can tell those from people with a grimace.  “I remember I was in Bristol about two and a half years ago and a lady came from a behind a coffee table. “She said ‘Do you realise that things have come on so much now that you can fix his eyes?’. I just remember looking at her.” This summer being chosen for the Marks \u0026amp Spencer back to school campaign marked Lucus’ biggest work yet thanks to child agency Kiddiwinks. For his family the work represents an important step in including people with Down’s Syndrome in the mainstream media. Since then family and friends have sent Lucus pictures of his posters from all over the world, including as far as Dubai. Kellie said: “Lucus loves seeing himself on TV and seeing his siblings but with Marks \u0026amp Spencer it was the first time he was shocked. “He did the shoot and they took the photos and they came back and said they want to use it worldwide. “It’s just so great to see a child with Down’s Syndrome in shops like M\u0026ampS.”  You can follow Lucus and his siblings on their Instagram page.   Cora\u0027s story      At 21 weeks pregnant Sheryl Bishop was told there were complications with her unborn daughter Cora. Refusing the option to terminate the pregnancy, the 32-year-old and her partner Daniel went forward not knowing what to expect. “We knew there were complications with the pregnancy from 20 weeks,” Sheryl, from Brymbo, said. “We were told her heart hadn’t developed, her brain hadn’t developed, and her face hadn’t developed so we were expecting something much worse. “All the way through we were pushed for a termination before any sort of diagnosis, even at 37 weeks. “We were made aware of our options including tests and terminations and made it clear that the only way we would consider a termination was if our daughter was at risk of organ failure and would suffer from birth.”  At 39 weeks Cora was born after an emergency C-Section. Sheryl said: “Daniel was the first to hold her and his face said it all – he was smiling but he looked concerned so I knew something was wrong. “As soon as I saw her little face I knew that Cora had Down’s Syndrome. I felt a pang of pain and then a huge sense of relief that all the things we’d have been expecting were wrong.” ora is now seven years old and a pupil at Gwersyllt Primary School. Last April her family heard about Zebedee Management agency, who specialise in working with children with disabilities.  After being signed up Cora was soon invited to a casting for the River Island ‘Labels Are For Clothes’ campaign to celebrate diversity.  Following a 10-hour round trip and 10-minute audition Cora was selected together with other children aged between three and 10 for the campaign.  Mother-of-two Sheryl said: “Cora absolutely loved it – she was in her element being the centre of attention and making everyone laugh. “She loves all the big bows and girly things. “They took her to the set where they film the video and she just ran on and started playing with the balloons – they didn’t need to give her any direction.” Since her work for River Island, Cora has made an appearance on This Morning as well as starring in a video collaboration between Calpol and BuzzFeed. For her appearing in the M\u0026ampS campaign marked her greatest success yet. Sheryl said: “Holly [Willoughby] and Phil [Schofield] are so lovely – everyone said they would be but they were genuinely so nice. They were so complimentary to Cora, saying how beautiful and shiny her hair was.

As well as being banned indoors, dogs will also not be allowed in outside areas around its pubs, such as beer gardens. A JD Wetherspoon spokesman said that the group\u0027s hard-working staff had grown tired of picking up poop.

The exception to the rule is assistance dogs who will be allowed inside and beer gardens.  Announcing the news last month, a statement from Wetherspoons said: Please note that Wetherspoon has a policy of not allowing dogs in its pubs, including all outside areas. . This policy was introduced shortly after the company was founded in 1979, although in recent years we have allowed a few exceptions. After much consultation, we will now be strictly enforcing this policy everywhere. In order to give those affected time to adjust we have set a deadline of Monday, September 10, 2018. Wetherspoons, founded in 1979 by Tim Martin, has just under 1,000 outlets around the country.  Spokesman Eddie Gershon added: Even well behaved dogs can be unpredictable, every dog owner thinks their dog is perfect. We welcome a lot of children and families and younger children in particular can be unpredictable around dogs and many are scared of dogs. We serve a lot of food.

Dubbed System 001, this giant sea sieve is the brainchild of a Dutch college drop-out who began working on his invention aged 18, five years ago Boyan Slat has been obsessed with clearing plastic from the sea since a childhood holiday in Greece where he was disgusted with plastic waste in the water and vowed to devote his life to clearing it up. Back home in the Netherlands, he quit his aerospace engineering studies at the Delft University of Technology and founded the nonprofit Ocean Cleanup, where he is now CEO with a staff of 65 engineers and scientists. His ungainly device sailed under the Golden Gate bridge yesterday in the hope it will help collect rubbish fromthe Great Pacific Garbage Patch which is thought to be the size of Texas.  Slat’s Dutch non-profit orgnaisation has gathered support from several foundations and philanthropists, including billionaire Salesforce founder Marc Benioff. In 2017, the Ocean Cleanup Project received \u0026pound4.5 million in donations and reported reserves from donations in previous years of \u0026pound13 million. He has won accolades from the King of Norway, a top environmental award from the United Nations, and his name appears on ious lists, including one by Forbes magazine, of rising young entrepreneurial leaders. The Ocean Cleanup Project’s system is made up of a series of connected pipes the length of five football fields that float at the surface of the ocean.  Each closed pipe is 4 feet in diameter and below these hang a 9-foot net skirt. The system moves more slowly than the water, allowing the currents and waves to push trash into its centre to collect it. Floating particles are captured by the net while the push of water against the net propels fish and other marine life under and beyond. The system is fitted with solar-powered lights and anti-collision systems to keep any stray ships from running into it, along with cameras, sensors and satellites that allow it to communicate with its creators.

Other questions - supposedly designed to examine the students’ moral compass - asked them if it was appropriate for a TV host to kill a baby rabbit with a knife live on air. The teacher who dished out the test has now been placed on leave as the school probes the incident. And parents and education chiefs say it simply went too far. One question asks: “Using both a condom and the pill, a brother and sister decide that they want to sleep with each other – just once, to see what it would be like.”  Under the questions were a series of red and green thumbs up and down hand gestures to show how much a student is for or against each statement.

The move on Saturday came as part of a bid to promote tourism after falling visitor numbers in the country, which suffered following political upheaval in 2011 and the downing of a Russian plane in 2015. The tomb, discovered in 1940 by Egyptologist Zaki Saad, belongs to an ancient Egypt high-ranking official named Mehu who was related to the first king of the 6th dynasty. The tomb included two chambers, both with wall inscriptions of the owner of the tomb hunting.  There are also drawings showing aspects of Ancient Egyptian lives such as hunting and acrobatic dancing. Mehu lived during the reign of King Pepi and held 48 titles, found inscribed on the walls of his chamber. The head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Mostafa Al-Waziri, said: It is a 4500-year old tomb from the 6th dynasty.  It is during the King Pepi rule,  he continued. It is a family tomb of a father, son and grandson. We are seeing Mehu, his son Meren Ra and his grandson Heteb Kha. The tombs owner had 48 titles. Archaeologists have so far this year excavated a number of relics that include a 4,400-year-old tomb at the Giza plateau and an ancient necropolis in Minya, south of Cairo. Egypt is hoping these discoveries will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travelers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids but who have shunned the country since its 2011 political uprising.

Named by the politan Police as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, the pair are suspected of being GRU military intelligence agents who used aliases when they poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia earlier this year.   However political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky said the two - caught on CCTV images travelling to and from Salisbury - could have been executed to hide the traces of the alleged crime.  This weekend Home Secretary Sajid Javid said Petrov and Boshirov would both be arrested if they ever left Russia but admitted that was unlikely.  If they are still alive then they should make themselves known to the public in Russia, claimed Piontkovsky. He compared the case to the killers of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko by a polonium poisoning in London in 2006. Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun had gone public to deny the claims soon after being accused by Britain - and the Russian authorities then protected them, said Piontkovsky. Lugovoy and Kovtun rescued themselves by running to Ecko  and going public,” he said. “One  even had to be made an MP.  “If \u0027Petrov\u0027 and \u0027Bashirov\u0027 don\u0027t appear in the coming days, it means they are already dead.”  This comes amid a massive assault on Britain by Moscow’s state-run media which ignored more than 1,000 people being detained in ugly clashes during protests against Putin\u0027s unpopular pension reforms and instead blasted an “epidemic of lies” over Novichok by Theresa May’s government.  There has been speculation that the perpetrators of the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, an act which killed 298 people, could have been killed.  That has also been linked to the GRU. This would remove those who could one day testify about Moscow’s role in the horror, it has been claimed. State TV launched a new offensive on Britain over the accusations that GRU agents using the names Petrov and Boshirov were behind the chemical weapon poisoning in Salisbury. This coincided with with anti-Putin protests over raising the pension age - which were not mentioned.  Vesti Nedeli show accused London of an epidemic of lies, with presenter Dmitry Kiselyov - dubbed Putin’s propagandist-in-chief, claiming May was using the Skripal case to cover-up the failure of her Brexit policy.  TV shows slammed the idea that professional Russian agents would be so easily seen on CCTV images or fail to kill their target.  Itogi Nedeli\u0027s TV anchor Irada Zeynalova claimed the British Prime Minister needed a foreign enemy to rally Britain, and chose Russia. Petrov and Boshirov were being turned into Russian villains to the extent it was surprising they were not pictured in traditional Ushanka fur hats with ear flaps, she claimed. Russian state-run TV assures its viewers that the Novichok poisoning was the work of British or western secret services. Weekly Vremya claimed the plot could not get any more absurd” and alleged Britain had invented crude stereotypes of Russian baddies as seen in Arnold Schwarzenegger film Red Heat. The events showed the infantilism of British society”.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether disappointing scotland sides always bounce back with shock result","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scotland international football team never fails to disappoint.Then, just as you are thinking of abandoning them completely, they come up with a classic result.None more so, of course, than in the World Cup in Argentina in 1978.We failed miserably against Peru and Iran, then took Holland to the cleaners.A Holland side which then went all the way to the final.I came across another startling example of this when perusing through files.In 1963, Scotland, under manager Ian McColl, embarked on a mini close-season tour.

Lochee!”Rob continued: “When they levelled the hallowed ground of Maloney’s Park and razed Tipperary, Whorterbank and old tenements, there was no migration of families travelling north — just a casual flit to the sleepy Lochee suburbs of Clement Park, Dryburgh and Menzieshill.“The community of Lochee had been disturbed.“However, the social support and camaraderie among Lochee folks serves as a buffer against any adversity — and the neighbourhood and its football infrastructure remained intact.”Finally, from Rob, a rallying call.He concluded: “How does one honour a historic community, how does a city pay tribute to a geographic location that has such longevity and tradition and such a rich history of sports unequalled by any other Dundee neighbourhood?“Surely there must be recognition, some acknowledgement of Lochee achievements.“What if an expert in heraldry could design a coat of arms that illustrates Lochee’s community spirit and successful sports history.“I know Lochee folks to be modest by nature, it’s a characteristic I admire.“However, I am curious what form of recognition they think would be a fitting tribute to their historic town?”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b92a037afa2f.jpg ","title":"dundee council set to net seven figure sum for sell off of waterfront land","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA residential site at the Waterfront is set to be snapped up for a seven-figure sum this week, the Tele has learned.Councillors are to meet on tonight to discuss a number of land sell-offs to allow further development in Dundee.Among the areas that will be discussed behind closed doors is the newly-approved residential block to be built on Site 6, across the road from the V\u0026ampA.Ediston Real Estate, which submitted the planning application to build the flats, was among the bidders for the land, the deed for which still rests with Dundee City Council.It has reportedly submitted a bid of £1.45 million.However, the Tele has learned that Robertson Capital Projects has come in with a higher bid which is likely to be approved tonight.Robertson Capital – part of the Robertson Group, which is also building the office block on Site 6 – is understood to have submitted a bid of £1.6m for the right to build on the site.A source said: “The meeting will decide on the sale of the area which will have the block of flats built on it. The council still owns the site at the moment.“The architects and developers who lodged the application said they wouldn’t buy the land until they were given planning permission.“Ediston Real Estate put in a bid but it has been outbid by Robertson Capital, which has submitted a bid of £1.6m.“It is very likely that it will get waved through on Monday.”Discussions on the deal are to be held in private, with few details of the meeting publicly available.The plan to build 99 flats on Site 6 were approved by councillors last month following Ediston’s application. The block will sit on the north-eastern corner of the site, away from the office block currently under construction that overlooks the V\u0026ampA.A total of eight plots have been earmarked for Site 6, with a central courtyard in the middle.At last month’s planning committee, councillors disagreed over the decision not to require planners to include parking spaces at the complex for residents.Conservative West End councillor Donald Hay had attempted to stop the development but could not find a seconder to enable his motion to be put to a vote.Mr Hay said he was concerned at the number of flats being built without parking in the city centre.However, former city development chief Mike Galloway said people would be able to apply for the residents’ parking scheme, which would give them access to city centre multi-storey car parks.He added that the council could build further parking facilities in the city centre if demand was identified but there were as yet no plans to do so.The nearest car park is the Greenmarket multi-storey, a few minutes’ walk away.The city council declined to comment.The Robertson Group and Ediston Real Estate had not responded to a request for comment at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee have a real gem in young striker cedwyn scott says berwick boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee striker Cedwyn Scott has earned high praise after a brace on his debut for Berwick.Boss Robbie Horn was highly impressed by the teenager.His double came in a 5-3 win at Albion Rovers when he grabbed the third and fifth goals in a dramatic tie.Horn said: “My research had shown that Cedwyn was a good player but he is better than I had hoped for.

I didn’t get down on one knee though.”The wedding was booked for July 28 2018 at the Rose Function Suite.When the day came, the bride stepped into her beautiful dress from Bliss Bridal that she admits was “even bonnier than I remembered” but it wasn’t all going swimmingly.In the morning, the rain was pouring down and Rachael was devastated.She wanted her pictures beside Broughty Ferry Castle and it didn’t look like it was going to happen.She need not have worried though as the sun shone and dried the pavements so photographer Lyndsey Phillip got the pair to the iconic building after their ceremony and took the picture-perfect shots, just as Rachael had wanted.The bride said: “The photos are absolutely stunning so a big thank you to Lyndsey for making it happen.”During the day the bride was accompanied by bridesmaids Kirsty Noble, Gemma Clark and Laura Clark and her two daughters acted as flowergirls.Adele’s brother Ronan was also Patrick’s groomsman and even at the tender age of 12 he took it all in his stride.Patrick added: “It didn’t faze Ronan at all. He is a bit of a showman anyway so he loved it.”When it came to Patrick choosing his best man, the choice was easy – his dad Patrick Sr would take on the honour.Patrick said: “He is my best pal so it seemed right to have him as my best man. It made him so happy as well.”Rachael added: “He is one of Patrick’s biggest supporters so it made sense.“My dad Paul passed away when I was about 12, so I was walked down the aisle by my stepdad Ronnie Kelly.

I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b92a88abb327.jpg ","title":"kyle falconer on dundee weve always been standing on the shoulders of edinburgh and glasgow but its our time now","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKyle Falconer will join the likes of Primal Scream and Be Charlotte by performing at the opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee this week.The View frontman has been announced as the latest name appearing on the main stage on Saturday during the 3D Festival in Slessor Gardens.Up to 20,000 people are expected to attend the festival next Friday and Saturday as the long-awaited £80 million design museum finally opens.While Friday night’s event headlined by Primal Scream is sold out, Kyle will take to the stage at 12.30pm the following day at the non-ticketed Saturday programme.With The View on indefinite hiatus, Kyle has been touring his debut solo album No Thank You.But he admitted to feeling a tiny bit relieved when he finally got the call inviting him to play at next Saturday’s opening.“At the start when everyone was getting invited to play I was a bit put out because I hadn’t been asked,” Kyle told the Tele.“I thought it’s because The View haven’t been doing anything for a while, but then I got the call so it’s all good.

They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"restrictions on tay road bridge","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRestrictions are on place on the Tay Road Bridge this morning.Due to high winds, the bridge is closed to double-decker buses.\u0026mdash Tay Road Bridge  September 10, 2018The 50mph limit has also been cut to 30mph for all vehicles.Measures were placed at 1.55am and are still in place for the morning rush-hour.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil mccann leaves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee supporters have revealed who they want to take over if Neil McCann leaves the club.Five straight defeats at the start of the season have heaped pressure on the current incumbent of the Dens Park hot seat.The Dee are slumped at the foot of the Premier League table and with a trip to McCann\u0026#8217s former employers Rangers next up, on September 15, there are concerns the club could soon become entrenched in the drop zone.A Tele online poll revealed yesterday that 80% of surveyed fans wanted McCann to leave.In the same survey we asked who supporters would want to take over in the event of McCann\u0026#8217s departure, and the voting was tight.Of the 186 people who suggested a new manager, the most preferred candidate was Robbie Neilson, with 28 votes. 100vw, 643px\" /The 38-year-old, who made 21 appearances for Dundee United in 2011-12, led Hearts from the Championship to the Europa League in the space of two years before leaving for MK Dons in November 2016.

insight into iconic city landmark","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAt 572 feet above sea level, it is the iconic natural landmark that dominates the Dundee skyline. 100vw, 824px\" / 100vw, 2560px\" /But while today it is a popular vantage point with spectacular views over the city and the Tay, the Law has played many roles throughout human history – including graveyard, quarry and home to a train tunnel.Commonly believed to have been an extinct volcano, the Law is actually a magma sill – formed when magma intrudes between rock layers.Colin Donald, from the Dundee Law Heritage Project, discovered during research of the site that Bronze Age graves were dug beneath what is now allotments – and that the peak was previously home to a hill fort.The structure, known in ancient and medieval times as as a “dun”, contributed half of the city of Dundee’s name.More recently, during the industrial era, a 330-yard long train tunnel to Newtyle was created on the Law in 1829 in which carriages were originally pulled by horse.The northern end of the tunnel was buried in the 1950s, with the southern end sealed in 1981.Dundee Corporation bought the Law from Dudhope Estates for £4,500 in 1878, in response to public pressure for a recreational space as the population of Dundee grew.Colin will be exploring the Law’s fascinating history when he gives a talk at a meeting of Abertay Historical Society.He said: “The talk will go back to the earliest human history of the Law.“Starting from the Bronze Age, there were graves there but they were excavated long ago.“There’s also evidence from the Iron Age.“At some point, it may have been used for farming or settlements.“I’ll be speaking about how the Law played a large part in the industrial history of Dundee with the train tunnel, the quarry and up to more modern uses.“It’s bizarre to think that they used to have a train line running to Newtyle that used to go up rather than through.“Most people seem to think of the Law simply as a viewing point but that is just one aspect of what it has to offer.”Colin, 49, has worked closely with the Friends of Dundee Law and the Dundee Law Heritage Project to help improve the features surrounding the hill.Funding has been put towards resurfacing the path to the summit and planting on its slopes.And plans are being drawn up to attract more visitors.Colin hopes that his talk will inspire more people to take an interest in the history of the impressive peak.He added: “It has always been there – even before the city of Dundee itself.“Whoever had settled there before I’m sure would have looked to it as a major focal point of their area.“I do feel as though the Law is very much taken for granted.“Dundee City Council uses the Law in its logo and it’s a huge feature in a lot of things connected to Dundee.“I think that when people see the Law, especially people who are coming back to the city, they see home.“I think it’s important and interesting for people to learn about the Law and its history because it is such an important part of Dundee.“It is at the heart of the city and we want to preserve the Law for generations of Dundonians to come.”Colin will be giving his talk at the University of Dundee’s Dalhousie Building on Wednesday, starting at 6.30pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/5a53492e86b36.jpg

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face.

And McInnes hailed Shinnie for retaining his spot in McLeish’s squad.He said: “Hopefully Graeme can continue to establish himself with Scotland not only through training with them but out on the pitch with game time.“With the squad Graeme was involved in at the end of last season there were a lot of the Celtic players and established players left out.“It was an opportunity for Graeme to go and show Alex his capability through his training and through games.“He has obviously done that and has also started the season well for us, especially in the two games against Burnley in the Europa League.“He was very influential in those games against Burnley.“Graeme has got the recognition for that by remaining in the squad and I am delighted for him.”Shinnie is the only Aberdeen player in McLeish’s Scotland squad that will face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium tonight.That friendly is a warm-up for the UEFA Nations League opener against Albania on Monday.Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna would have been named in the squad if fit.However, the 21-year-old missed out with a hamstring tear that has ruled him out of Aberdeen’s last four games.McInnes anticipates McKenna, who captained Scotland in the 2-0 loss to Mexico, to return immediately after the international break.The subject of a rejected £7 million transfer deadline day bid from Aston Villa, centre-back McKenna is set to return for the trip to St Johnstone on Saturday September 15.McInnes hopes club captain Shinnie can face a Belgium side packed with world class talents such as Eden Hazard , Romelu Lukaku , Marouane Fellaini  and Vincent Kompany .He reckons facing opponents of that calibre can only help Shinnie’s own game improve.McInnes said: “Any time you go away to be involved with your country is a brilliant experience.“Graeme will be involved with some of the countries’ top players.“Then he will also hopefully get the games on top of that.“Ideally he can get game time against Belgium and Albania.“Belgium have some top class players involved and all of that is great for any player’s development.”McInnes and Aberdeen aim to tie up skipper Shinnie on an extended contract.The midfielder’s current deal expires at the end of this season and Shinnie would be free to speak with any interested club from the start of the winter transfer window on January 1.McInnes recently confirmed he would sit down with Shinnie and his agent to try to thrash out a new extended contract.The Aberdeen gaffer also confirmed he has been in regular contact with McLeish regarding Scotland internationalists.He said: “I spoke to Alex after the two Scotland games in the summer and a few times since.“Graeme has made a good impression and it is great to see him in the squad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dons looking to benefit from us soccer boom","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen aim to tap further into the lucrative United States market to secure financial backing in a bid to help take the club to another level.Pittodrie commercial director Rob Wicks hopes the Dons can secure new opportunities across the Atlantic, where soccer is booming.American-based businessman Tom Crotty invested £775,000  into Aberdeen last November after buying up shares.US-based software entrepreneur and investor, Dave Cormack, made a substantial seven-figure investment in the Dons last June through the acquisition of shares.Life-long Aberdeen fan Cormack, who had previously held the role of Pittodrie chief executive from 2000 to 2001, was also appointed to the Dons board.Wicks said: “Football is doing some amazing things in the United States.“We have Dave Cormack, a major shareholder at the club and also a board director who is based over there.“Dave is very well placed within the United States market to look at new opportunities for us.”Aberdonian Cormack introduced venture capitalist Crotty to the Dons.Crotty is a board member and major donor to US-founded charity Grassroot Soccer which was set up by Tommy Clark, the son of legendary Dons keeper Bobby.Aberdeen, AFC Community Trust and the now global-based Grassroot recently entered into a formal partnership that focuses on adolescent health and well-being.Through the partnership a football-inspired education programme for young people around mental health will be piloted at Aberdeen’s new £47m super academy at Lochside.On confirmation of his investment last year Crotty admitted his first experience of Aberdeen was golf and playing the north-east’s courses. Cormack utilised that link and made a compelling case about Aberdeen’s future plans.Wicks said: “There is such a strong relationship with the US and Scotland as we have the likes of Donald Trump and his golf.“If you look at the visitor statistic of people coming into Scotland a very high proportion are Americans.“They love golf, the whisky trail and there are some really interesting opportunities for us to broaden that relationship and look at new ideas and partnerships.”Football, or “soccer”, is thriving in the United States and is closing in on the big three of American football, basketball and baseball.A Gallup poll recently found 7% of Americans named soccer as their favourite sport to watch.That represented a 3% gain from four years previously.Soccer was the only sport to post such a large increase.Gridiron was at 37%, down from 39%, basketball 11%, down from 12%, and baseball 9%, down from 13%. Ice hockey was at 4%, up from 3%. Only 1% of those polled over 55 named soccer as their favourite sport while the figure was 11% between those aged 18-34.It is expected soccer will surpass baseball in popularity.The rise of soccer in the United States also came despite the national team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup in Russia – the first time they had not been at the finals since 1986.The MLS recently signed an historic eight-year TV deal with ESPN, Fox Sports and Univision worth 720m with games now broadcast in 140 countries.“You look at some of the clubs out there in the MLS and what they are achieving and the fan experience that they are able to deliver,” said Wicks.“There is a lot we can learn and we have to be cognisant of that. There are wider opportunities.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen woman forever grateful to liver donor","story":"\t\t\t\t\tElaine Baxter from Dyce went from being healthy to being put in an induced coma and going through a liver transplant within the space of a few weeks.The 58-year-old underwent a transplant in 2013 after falling ill when her liver stopped working.She said: “I wasn’t on the waiting list at all, because I just took ill very suddenly.“I was really nauseous and very, very tired, but unknown to me, this was me going into a coma.

Topping the mini group will see the Scots square off against the three other best teams in League C for a place in the Euro 2020 play-offs – a vital second chance should the Dark Blues fail to reach a first major tournament since 1998 via conventional qualifying.Fraser hopes Scotland’s three-at-the-back system can allow him, at wing-back, to get forward more against the Albanians after being pinned back by Hazard \u0026amp Co.He said: “I don’t think you can call it wing-back against Belgium – it’s more right-back.“It’s difficult and when I did play it a little bit for Bournemouth last season it was when we had more of the ball.“With Bournemouth we keep the ball a lot better than we did on Friday, as we’re not against the level of opponent we faced.“Tonight it’ll be a little bit better.“Against Belgium my role was trying to contain  Hazard coming over, his brother ,  Dembele.  Vertonghen was stepping in and it was sometimes four against me and John Souttar.“I thought we did well early in the first half and later in the second half, but they got their goal.”Fraser admits he prefers winger to wing-back, but he’ll give his all for the national side wherever he’s told to.He added: “I’d like to , but I can’t complain where I’m playing.“I just need to get on with it as I’m in no situation to tell managers where I should be playing and what formations to play.“Wherever I’m told I’ll do 100% that I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"souttar in no doubt tonight is key game","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCentre-back John Souttar knows Scotland’s UEFA Nations League opener with Albania tonight is the “big one” in terms of the current international break.Hearts’ Souttar, 21, who made his Dark Blues debut on Friday, playing 90 minutes of the 4-0 friendly defeat to Belgium, is hoping for his second cap.The Nations League offers Alex McLeish’s Scotland a route to the Euro 2020 play-offs should they fail to reach their first major tournament in 20 years via the traditional route.It will be the first competitive game of McLeish’s second spell, against a team 18 places below Scotland in the world rankings.Aberdeen-born and Luthermuir-raised Souttar thinks the occasion in Glasgow will be totally different to the hammering against the Belgians – third at this summer’s World Cup.He said: “It’s going to be a completely different game, as we know.“Against Belgium, you get nothing and it’s not the end of the world.“Albania’s the big one. If we put in a positive result that’ll be the one we’ve been striving for all week, and that’s the most important thing.”Scotland will take on the Albanians and Israel home and away in League C1 of the Nations League, before a semi-final and final against the other three best tier C teams for a play-off berth.The home side will have to be better than they were on Friday, where, after a positive 20 minutes of restricting the Belgians to pot shots and not being afraid to try to get forward themselves, an error-strewn performance saw them ship four soft goals to the lethal Red Devils.Souttar, who is tipped to be the future of Scotland’s defence alongside Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna – currently out with a hamstring tear – acquitted himself well, however.He showed a calmness under pressure, with ability to play out from the back, and was delighted to earn his first cap despite the circumstances.He said: “It was a tough night. It was a learning curve.“But I’ve made my debut and that was something I’ve been striving for for a long time.“So on a selfish note it was a positive night for me. But collectively it was disappointing.”Souttar added: “It’s something I’ve been looking to do for a long time .“They were a top team and you saw them in the World Cup, how good they were.“It was always going to be a difficult test with a new group of players.“We’d only been together a week – five days actually.“For the manager to get all of his ideas across was always going to be difficult, but we need to hit the ground running against Albania and eradicate any mistakes.”If Scotland can get themselves back into major tournament football, Souttar is looking forward to pulling on the dark blue shirt and taking on world class opposition more regularly.He said: “That’s where you want to be in your career – playing them  every week.“For myself, against them, it was enjoyable.“Obviously the result wasn’t enjoyable, but I enjoyed the occasion.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notifications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notifications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specifying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item if they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notifications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identification. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly different in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line.

nurseries for delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nWe asked Scottish Borders Council\u0027s education department to respond to the criticism but they didn\u0027t get back to us.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"cost-of-replacing-primark-belfast-store-covered-by-insurance","story":"The cost of replacing the Belfast Primark store which was destroyed by fire will be covered by

section of the listed sandstone building, which was being refurbished and extended at an estimated of cost of \u0026pound30 million, was destroyed by last month\u0026rsquos blaze.\nSome 1,500 staff and shoppers were safely evacuated from the blaze but the embers smouldered for three days.\nFirefighters were able to prevent the flames spreading to an extension at the rear of the building.\nSome 1,500 staff and shoppers were safely evacuated from the blaze \nA statement from AB Foods said: \u0026ldquoThe Primark store in central Belfast was sadly destroyed by fire in August.\n\u0026ldquoAll staff and customers were quickly and safely evacuated from the building.\n\u0026ldquoThe replacement cost of the building and resulting business interruption is insured.\nPrimark has said it will continue to pay its Belfast workers until December 31.\nAround 300 people worked at the discount fashion chain.\nA safety cordon around the building will remain in place for at least four months.\nThis sparked fury from other businesses who remain within the sealed-off zone and unable to trade, with some calling for the Bank Buildings to be demolished, instead of work continuing to preserve the historic facade.\nBelfast City Council said a dedicated phone line has been set up  for those affected.\nFrom this week, where this can be safely facilitated, the Council will begin assisting traders located within the cordon who wish to access their property.\nA list of vacant properties that could be used for possible relocation has been drawn up, and a facility for temporary office accommodation at ious locations has been offered to businesses.\n.push,i[r].l=1*new

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a uniform and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging

collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said

One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-flats-at-former-musselburgh-tesco-set-to-start-in-spring","story":"  Plans were approved by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee nearly a year ago.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Planning permission for a new cemetery to be included next to a housing development currently being built at Dolphingstone, beside Royal Musselburgh Golf Club, was initially approved three years ago. However, environment agency SEPA raised concerns about the impact a burial ground would have on water quality on the site and plans to build there stalled.

The site is a popular gathering place for youths in the area and, although covered by CCTV, it has not acted as a deterrent.  There have previously been reports of vandalism and people breaking into the building.  An external inspection in May 2011 found \u0026ldquoa fine former infant school which externally is in generally sound condition but vacant and in need of a new use.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.

They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not just a rugby club any longer \u0026ndash it has several different aspects to it as a community hub.  \u0026ldquoI do not see a problem in relation to the licence.

We hope to continue to grow the use of our facilities by the North Berwick community.  At the meeting, Mr Fruzynski criticised the club for not sending anyone to attend the hearing, at Haddington Town House last Thursday.

Mr Dove apologised to the licensing board, via the Courier, and added: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that we have changed our licence and we simply didn\u0026rsquot know that it was possible to attend.  Councillor Jane Henderson, a North Berwick Coastal ward member who sits on the licensing board, pointed out that the club\u0026rsquos failure to represent itself could prove financially costly as they were not able to challenge conditions attached to the licence.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8124625.jpg?htype=934\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cost-of-replacing-primark-belfast-store-covered-by-insurance","story":"  The interruption to the clothing firm\u0026rsquos business was also underwritten, an update from the retailer\u0026rsquos owner Associated British Foods  said.

Instead of glorious failure, events conspired to send Shelley Kerr and her players to next summer\u0026rsquos World Cup in France.  The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it? Nothing compares to this. I\u0026rsquom delighted for all the players, the organisation and all the other people who support us. We had seven or eight good chances, we\u0026rsquove hit the post again and we should have made it more comfortable but I\u0026rsquom no going to dissect the performance.  \u0026ldquoThe whole week has been so tense and I\u0026rsquove tried to keep calm as a coach. I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half.

The latest Social Attitudes Survey showing that the number of people view independence as a positive for Scotland\u0027s economy now outnumber those who believe otherwise.  \"These indications are greatly encouraging as we continue to build the fresh case for an independent Scotland.\"  Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \"The SNP party faithful can get together for coffee and a blether as often as they wish but it doesn\u0027t alter the fact that the people of Scotland voted decisively to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014.  \"Keith Brown\u0027s comments only illustrate the one deep and substantive division - between the SNP and the democratic will of Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Salmond   s determination to clear his name could tear the SNP apart","story":"  The former First Minister is the most formidable fighter in politics and will not to go quietly into that good political night. His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8544879.jpg?type=article-full","title":"book-your-christmas-party-venue-at-one-of-these-five-festive-spots","story":"  If\u0026nbspyou\u0027re looking for an exciting location for\u0026nbspyour work party\u0026nbspor somewhere to enjoy Christmas lunch, consider these fantastic five restuarants...  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Drimsynie Estate  If you\u0026rsquore looking for somewhere a little different to impress your clients, or maybe just take your work Christmas party up a notch, Drimsynie Estate could be the choice for you.

The V\u0026ampA Dundee, as well as being a show-stopping piece of architecture courtesy of the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, is also a keynote building in the future of the city in which it is based, part of Dundee\u0026rsquos long-term plans for the waterfront .  As a result, it\u0026rsquos difficult to imagine a building in Scotland that will open with more hype, hope and razzmatazz.  \u0026ldquoThe opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee is a big moment, agrees Long. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a big moment for the institution, but it\u0026rsquos a big moment in the life of Dundee. And I get a sense that there\u0026rsquos excitement about the project much further afield than that. So, we want to make sure that it\u0026rsquos celebrated in a pretty spectacular way.  Over and above the celebrations that will accompany the opening , the museum is also tasked with creating an economic uplift for the city, in effect Dundee\u0026rsquos very own \u0026ldquoBilbao effect. No small task in a city that has been hit in recent decades by all the typical problems blighting post-industrial cities.  When we speak the opening is still a few weeks away. Long is sitting in a Portakabin across from the museum\u0026rsquos staff entrance, discussing the past, present and future of this project. When he first came to Dundee in 2011 the city\u0026rsquos waterfront had a long way to go. Where we are sitting, he points out, was the site of the city\u0026rsquos brutalist swimming pool. He used to go himself and be \u0026ldquohorrified and exhilarated by the fumes, he says.  All change. Across the way the museum remains sealed off from prying eyes but the fit-out is complete, the installation of the exhibitions and displays very advanced and the restaurant and caf\u0026eacute ready to go. It\u0026rsquos a Thursday in mid-August. \u0026ldquoOn Monday we have all our visitor assistants starting. That is exciting, says Long.  \u0026ldquoAbout two years we sat down as a team and said what needs to be achieved by the opening day and worked back from that to see exactly what needed to happen in relation to everything else that needed to be done and who needed to do it. And we are on track with that plan.  As you would expect, Long is an articulate spokesman for his museum. Married with two boys, he\u0026rsquos a young-looking 52, who\u0026rsquos been working on this project since 2011. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom a little greyer than I was seven years ago, he says. \u0026ldquoI need a haircut. But I\u0026rsquove been busy.  Well, indeed. The construction of the museum has been a huge financial and technical challenge. Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos original plans had to be reined in when the tenders for the building came in much higher than expected almost double the original \u0026pound45m. And though more money was found for its construction  it still proved a complex and testing build.  Not that Long was ever in any doubt that it would be completed. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been developed in quite a small city, comparatively, in difficult years of political complexity and economic uncertainty. And I think the prospect of a new V\u0026ampA here was such an exciting prospect that I never thought it wasn\u0026rsquot going to happen.  Now it is on his shoulders to make it a success, of course. Is he ready for the challenge? The size of it is certainly clear to him.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, I was a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland with a responsibility for managing elements of that. But I think there is not much that can prepare anybody for the scale of this project, he admits  But that, adds Long, is also the thrill of it. \u0026ldquoTo have the responsibility to develop a new design institution in Scotland that will take very seriously its role to help people understand why design is important, that is going to look at the amazing design creativity of this country, that can bring international exhibitions to Scotland in that wonderful building, and be part of the V\u0026ampA family, then that is an amazing prospect.  The question might be what does that all entail? Or, to put it more bluntly, what does a director do? He breaks his answer into pre and post opening. \u0026ldquoThe responsibility of the director during the development phase is to develop a sense of ambition and vision for the project. What is it? What is it going to be?  And, having done so, he adds, get that vision across to the people working on the building, its stakeholders and the general public.  His job will now change, Long says. \u0026ldquoThe role will be to make sure that it does fulfil those ambitions and its intention to be an institution that helps make people understand why design is important in all our lives is fulfilled, that it creates opportunities to get more people involved, and that it makes a contribution not just to Dundee but to the country more widely.  What he wants is a building that is welcoming to everyone in Dundee. \u0026ldquoMuseums can be intimidating places or seen as places for an elite. We have developed V\u0026ampA Dundee to challenge that.  In what way? Outreach programmes, talks, forming young people\u0026rsquos groups, he explains. \u0026ldquoWe have engaged with over 100,000 people since 2012 and many of those are here in Dundee.  In a parallel universe Long could have been exhibiting in the museum rather than running it. Or even building the thing.  \u0026ldquoI almost became an architect when I was at school. I had a place to do architecture so maybe doing V\u0026ampA Dundee is fulfilling some of these early ambitions, he says.  Having grown up in Edinburgh\u0026nbspLong actually studied sculpture at art school. \u0026ldquoI trained as an artist, but I very quickly became interested in museums and galleries and how they could make a difference to people.  After studying in England, he returned to Scotland where he worked for the Fine Art Society in Glasgow, before getting a job as a junior curator at the National Galleries of Scotland. He then worked his way up to a senior position.  \u0026ldquoI had a chance to create exhibitions and work with artists and get involved in some major projects, like the development of the former Dean orphanage into the Dean Gallery, now Modern Two. I also looked after the development of Charles Jencks\u0026rsquos Landform and I worked on the development of the Artist Rooms project specifically so it could be shared across the country.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee is of a different order, it must be said. Because there is so much riding on it. But Long reckons it will deliver because the city wants it to. Needs it to, even.  \u0026ldquoWhen I came here what I sensed was there was a real enthusiasm and energy for making a change. But in terms of the physicality of the city there was much to be done on that. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is a complete new development contributing to the economic future of the city.  \u0026ldquoBut what I\u0026rsquove also seen is a sort of change in energy and sense of being able to get things done. Dundee applied to be UK City of Culture. It lost to Hull. It came a very close second, but it didn\u0026rsquot sit back and commiserate. Shortly afterwards it was successful in being awarded the title of Unesco City of Creative Design.  \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0026rsquove seen here in the city is one success leads to a greater ambition. There\u0026rsquos that sense in the city of: \u0026lsquoWe get things done here.\u0026rsquo I think that is really building confidence here.

He also claimed that improvements made to the school system by Labour would \u0026ldquoeradicate the desire of parents to use the independent sector.  However John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independence Schools, said:  \u0026ldquoEvery year, our schools save the Scottish education budget \u0026pound180m, add \u0026pound450m to the Scottish economy and generate \u0026pound250m in tax. In straightened times, they secure high attainment and offer subject choice, ied curricula, wide extra-curricular provision and learning support. They should be left alone to continue that contribution to the nation.  Labour last year unveiled plans to remove the \u0026ldquoVAT exemption on private school fees, the proceeds from which would be used to pay for free school meals in the state sector.  Across the UK, around 6.5 per cent of pupils are estimated to be educated independently, although the figure is lower in Scotland. North of the border, 29,647 children and young people \u0026ndash 4.1% of the total \u0026ndash attended one of the 72 establishments that were members of the Scis in 2016.  Defenders of the Labour plan believe it would provide a spending boost in state schools, while critics said it would create an exodus from the private sector which would end up costing the taxpayer.  McDonnell, an ally of leader Jeremy Corbyn, spoke to this newspaper about the impact of a policy Labour believes could raise between \u0026pound1bn and \u0026pound1.5bn.  With most of the proceeds earmarked for increased education spending, the Scottish Parliament could expect to receive a fixed share under the Barnett Formula.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur view is that private schools should be treated no differently in terms of their services than any others. That\u0026rsquos why we believe charging VAT is fair.  \u0026ldquoThat would give us the opportunity of raising significant funds that could then be invested in education as a whole. We don\u0026rsquot see why private schools should be treated differently in this way.  The MP said Labour is working on \u0026ldquodetailed costings for the policy but said \u0026pound100m would be line with what Holyrood could expect under Barnett.  In the context of investment and improvement in state schools, he added: \u0026ldquoI can see private schools becoming unnecessary.  Private schools are also facing higher costs in Scotland after the SNP Government backed the abolition of the tax relief they enjoyed on business rates, a decision that may cost the sector \u0026pound5m.  Scottish Tory MSP Liz Smith said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing to see a sustained attack on independent schools at a time when they have met the conditions of tougher charity tests and increased their provision of bursary support for those families who would otherwise not be able to attend independent schools."},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dem-leader-puts-pressure-on-sturgeon-to-back-brexit-vote","story":"  Addressing his party\u0026rsquos conference in Dunfermline, he urged the First Minister to \u0026ldquoget off the fence and \u0026ldquostand up for Britain\u0026rsquos place in Europe.  Mrs Sturgeon was expected to provide an update on her constitutional plans in August, but the UK Government\u0026rsquos handling of the Brexit negotiations delayed any statement she might have made.  Some senior Nationalists believe there is no prospect of another plebiscite before the next Holyrood election and Mrs Sturgeon herself has called on supporters to focus on the \u0026ldquowhy of independence, not the \"when\".  Speaking to fellow Liberal Democrats, Mr Rennie called on the SNP leader to join the campaign for a new Brexit vote:  \u0026ldquoThe case for a Brexit deal referendum is growing. More people are backing it across the United Kingdom. They know the country is on the wrong track.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP say they are open-minded on a final say.

Meanwhile, former party leader Tavish Scott said the Liberals had to offer voters an alternative to the left-wing politics of Jeremy Corbyn and the hard-Brexit policies espoused by Tory Boris Johnson.  Mr Scott called on the party to fill \"the glaring gap in modern politics\" and warned that if they could not be relevant \"then the world will pass us by\".  He stressed that \"this country needs better than it currently has\", saying that meant there was an \"opportunity\" for liberals, although he conceded:  \"We have not set any heather on fire since 2016, despite being the only avowedly pro-European party who should at least get a hearing from 48% of the electorate.  \"Tony Blair said yesterday that if the British public are offered a choice of Corbyn versus Boris at the next election they will be looking for something else.  \"He is right.

Foreign Editor David Pratt goes to the heart of the Kurdish Rojava Revolution and meets some of the women making it happen.  As befitting such a memorial to great sacrifice, it\u0026rsquos a solemn place. To wander its avenues flanked by 1,300 headstones one can only but ponder on the lives of those buried there. Sometimes though there are clues in the faces that peer out from the glass mounted framed photographs left by relatives and loved ones.  Most of those depicted are young, in their late teens and early twenties, and rather uncommon for a cemetery dedicated to fallen soldiers, many are women.  It was grey and overcast with brooding storm clouds scudding across the sky like giant Zeppelins, the day I visited the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery in the northeast Syrian town of Kobane.  Almost four years have passed since that bitter siege in 2014 when Islamic State  jihadists overran most of this city near the Turkish border, only to be beaten back by the determined and near legendary resistance of mainly Kurdish fighters.  Today many consider the battle for Kobane to be a key turning point in the war against IS in Syria.  Since then something equally extraordinary too has happened in this remote corner of northern Syria a place the Kurdish name for which is Rojava or quite literally Western Kurdistan.  It\u0026rsquos a story that defies the usual narratives about Syria and the Middle East. One totally at odds too with the reactionary, hierarchical, misogynistic and vehemently anti-democratic diktats espoused by the jihadists of IS.  It was six years ago when the Syrian government regime of President Bashar al- Assad found itself embroiled in a civil war. It was at that moment too that Kurdish political parties in Rojava declared autonomy and began their extraordinary project of self-government and equality for all races, religions, women and men. Out of this was born the Rojava Revolution as it has now become commonly known.  With gender and religious equality enshrined within the revolution\u0026rsquos constitution, women, especially, play a crucial role in shaping the political direction of this remarkable movement.  All too often in the course of the revolution women or their loved ones have also made the ultimate sacrifice for a cause in which so many here passionately believe.  Women\u0026rsquos People Protection Units  were formed that fought alongside their male counterparts in the YPG, both forces being under the command and control of the leading political party of the Rojava Kurds, the Democratic Union Party .  \u0026ldquoWe came to plant flowers, we do it once a week or whenever he comes to our mind, Zuleyxa Bilad tells me while standing in the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery with her daughter Gardenia alongside the grave of her husband who was killed in the bitter battle for Kobane.  It was at the height of the fighting that the YPG fighter was shot by an IS sniper in the city on a day that also saw 27 of his comrades killed, many women among them.  I asked Zuleyxa if her daughter Gardenia now five years old knew what had become of her father?  \u0026ldquoGardenia knows everything because I explained everything to her and sometimes she cries, Zuleyxa replies.  \u0026ldquoLater she will understand that her father along with his brothers and sisters died defending the revolution for all of us, so that life will be better for her and the next generation when they are adults, Zuleyxa added, before both mother and daughter continued adorning the grave with the flowers and plants they had brought from the market in Kobane.  Women have borne the brunt of the fight against IS and shouldered the responsibility of defending and shaping the Rojava Revolution in so many ways. Some like Zuleyxa have lost husbands, sons and daughters. Others themselves have served and perished on the frontlines.  So many of the graves in Kobane\u0026rsquos Martyr\u0026rsquos cemetery have the names of young women inscribed into the marble of their headstones or have pictures of them smiling and dressed in the khaki military fatigues of the all-female YPJ People\u0027s Self-Defence Units.  As well as resisting IS in Kobane, women were also involved as part of the umbrella Syrian Democratic Forces  that comprises both Kurds and Arabs, in the fierce fighting that culminated in October last year in the ousting of IS from its self-proclaimed capital Raqqa, most of which now lies in bomb blasted ruins.  More recently women have fought and died too on the battlefields surrounding the city of Afrin. There Turkish forces and their militia allies who have much in common with the jihadists of IS, have advanced forcing many Kurds and others to flee eastwards to Kobane.  \u0026ldquoOur family\u0027s ancestors have been living in Afrin for over 200 years, says Nuri Urik, a 45-year-old Kurd who, along with his family and thousands of others, was forced from Afrin by the fighting.  Today, he and his wife, children and grandchildren have taken up home in Kobane.  \u0026ldquoThe whole journey was traumatic with the constant bombing, but the moment that we left Afrin was the worst, nobody remained in the village, everyone left, Mr Urik recalled, of the day just a few months ago when he and his family fled.  During the journey, his daughter-in-law Hemide Dede was pregnant. Once in Kobane, she gave birth to his granddaughter Xedice, who when we talked was just weeks old.  Tough as life is in Kobane the womenfolk of Mr Urik\u0026rsquos family now find themselves in a very different environment to the one they would have been subject to had they stayed in Afrin at the mercy of the occupying Turkish forces and their Islamist militia allies.  The beating political heart of the Rojava project is generated by communal assemblies, in which local people take decisions for themselves, be it about jobs, the environment, healthcare, literacy, the rights of the displaced or whatever. In every sphere women are scrupulously given an equal voice to men and women co-chair every meeting and every assembly.  Emina Bekir and her colleagues Almaz Rumi and Heval Heyad run the Kobane Women\u0026rsquos Board, the sharp end of an administration that deals with the day-to-day work of providing facilities to help women, ranging from creches to literacy project for the elderly.  \u0026ldquoThings are far from ideal and basic resources remain out biggest problem, but we have every right to be proud of what we have achieved so far and with adequate overseas support who knows what we are capable of, says Emina Bekir head of the Kobane Women\u0026rsquos Board. She has a point. From local defence groups and Women\u0026rsquos Academies\u0026rsquo to advance equal opportunities in education to \u0026lsquoWomen\u0026rsquos Houses\u0026rsquo where those who have experienced domestic violence can find shelter, support and legal representation there is much to admire.  For their part critics have claimed that the Rojava revolution is \u0026lsquocultish,\u0026rsquo \u0026lsquocommunist\u0026rsquo or \u0026lsquopseudo Marxist\u0026rsquo to mention just some of the negative observations cast its way. But while there are elements of such characteristics, up close the Rojava Revolution remains democratic in a way many in the West would be envious of.  Real people by and large govern here, not the career and opportunist politicians that have come to plague so much of governance in the West.  The real internal hands-on workings of this system became clearer one afternoon while in Kobane when I visited a cultural centre where hundreds of local women and others displaced by the fighting from the city of Afrin had gathered for a conference. Young and not so young, all were members of the local \u0026lsquoParastina Jin\u0026rsquo a local community defence group.  \u0026ldquoRight now here in Rojava there is a revolution within the revolution, insisted Ayse Efendi, who is co-chair of the Movement for a Democratic Society and was presiding over the conference.  Married to former co-chairman of the PYD, Salih Muslim Muhammad, she like many women of the revolution I encountered was keen to stress that what is underway in Rojava is not just a fight for the rights of Kurdish women but also for non-Kurdish minorities, mostly Arabs but also Syriacs, Turkmen and Assyrians.  This is not just wishful thinking but implemented at the most basic level. If for example language difficulties arise during meetings or conferences then interpreters are provided as I myself witnessed.  No distinction on the basis of ethnicity or background is made and it doesn\u0026rsquot stop there. Beyond the region too what the Rojava experience represents says Ayse Efendi is \u0026ldquothe fight for women\u0026rsquos rights internationally.  This global outlook and senses of solidarity was something I was to hear time and again from women\u0026rsquos representatives in Rojava.  To date the Rojava womens\u0026rsquo achievements are nothing short of remarkable in a region traditionally very conservative and home to rural and peasant norms. Here the \u0026lsquoold ways\u0026rsquo included prevailing attitudes that saw the existence of child marriage and keeping women at home.  Many women made the point that historically the problems they faced derived mainly from two sources, the family and the state. Intimidation and arrest were for a long time common in this part of Syria for those women who did not toe the established line.  \u0026ldquoHistorically there were certain people in both these sections of society who believed that if women became educated and emancipated, they would become a source of problems for wider society and the then existing political infrastructure, says Nejbir Teyar a 24 year old spokeswoman for the Kongreya Star .  Kongreya Star is a confederation of Rojava women\u0026rsquos organisations whose guiding principle is that \u0026ldquowithout the liberation of women, a truly free society is impossible. It has been pivotal in the significant advances made in gender relations in the region.  \u0026ldquoWhen you look at Kurdish history, women have always been a powerful influence in the family but we have taken that influence and emphasised its positive rather than negative factors, Ms Teyar explained.  I put it to her that the Middle East was a challenging place to say the least for anyone seeking to enhance women\u0026rsquos rights and asked where might the Rojava women\u0026rsquos revolution be in say five years time?  \u0026ldquoWe are not daunted by such challenges, women have been suffering for thousands of year, but if we organise to get there then nothing can stop us, came her reply adding again too the importance of global solidarity.  \u0026ldquoWe do not see ourselves detached from other women\u0026rsquos struggles internationally, when we see a single women suffer we feel the pain, she told me.  On the morning that I left Kobane to begin my journey home it was an early start. In the dawn light we pulled up at the first of many checkpoints where a young women YPJ member dressed in camouflage fatigues and carrying a Kalashnikov rifle checked our ID. A short time later on the city\u0026rsquos outskirts we passed the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery shrouded in drizzle, but I could just make out the figures of other women YPJ members laying flowers on another grave. The Rojava Revolution goes on."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-could-get-10-pay-boost-under-35m-government-proposal","story":"  The package would include a three per cent rise for teachers earning up to \u0026pound80,000 a year and a separate \u0026pound25m to overhaul the main grade scale for those in the profession.  However, details of the plan have angered a trade union for other local government staff who are not being offered an extra \u0026pound25m.  Gary Smith, Scotland secretary of the GMB union, said: \u0026ldquoIf there is going to be a load more money for teachers, it\u0026rsquos going to be an explosive cocktail for public-sector pay talks.  Teachers\u0026rsquo pay is determined by a tripartite body that includes the Scottish Government, representatives from councils \u0026ndash as the employer \u0026ndash and union negotiators.  However, the group has failed to reach an agreement after the teaching unions called for a 10 per cent pay rise.  The Educational Institute of Scotland , which represents most teachers north of the Border, has signalled that strike action could be taken unless their demand is met.  Leaked papers from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which represents councils, provide a detailed summary of the revised proposal.  In March, Cosla made an initial offer to all bargaining groups, including teachers, of a three per cent rise for staff earning up to \u0026pound36,500 and two per cent for those on higher salaries. The proposal was rejected.  Derek Mackay, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, then wrote to Cosla last month and agreed to an additional \u0026pound10m which would extend the three per cent rise to teachers earning between \u0026pound36,501 and \u0026pound80,000.  He also backed another \u0026pound25m for a wider \u0026ldquorestructuring of the main pay scale, aimed at improving recruitment and retention.  The paper noted: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has proposed a better offer for teachers and is prepared to fund it. Collectively it represents an investment over its two elements of \u0026pound35m.  Cosla, which is responsible for making a formal pay offer, backed the plan this month and teacher representatives are now considering the detail.  A local authority source said the two elements, taken together, could result in a sizeable number of teachers getting a rise in excess of 10 per cent.  The Cosla paper cautioned that the new plan would not \u0026ldquoguarantee a settlement with the unions, but stated: \u0026ldquoWhat it would do, however, is force a decision by the EIS to gamble or settle. Gambling on getting a mandate for industrial action in pursuit of an unachievable claim when three per cent is on the table and a desirable restructuring of the main grade on offer would be a bold move by a trade union not known for foolhardy decisions.  The document also suggested that the Government had \u0026ldquoexpressed an eagerness to \u0026ldquode-couple that rise from the pay scale revamp, on the grounds that the second element is a \u0026ldquopolicy intervention designed to correct a \u0026ldquofailure in the teacher market.  Smith\u0026rsquos GMB members, who include cleaners and care workers, have also been offered three per cent \u0026ndash which the union rejected \u0026ndash but not an additional \u0026pound25m.  \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot grudge teachers anything, but our members are doing more work than ever. It will add fuel to the fire, he said.  Councillor Gail MacGregor, Cosla resources spokesperson, said the Government\u0026rsquos \u0026pound10m had been \u0026ldquomatched pound for pound by council leaders for the general workforce: \u0026ldquoIt should not be forgotten that Scottish local government is the employer and the one making the offer. We are also funding the vast majority of the offer to teachers within the limited resources we have at our disposal \u0026ndash so it would be wrong to solely focus on the \u0026pound10m from Government.  \u0026ldquoSecondly there is a separate discussion around the \u0026pound25m for restructuring of the pay grade and a joint commitment to look at that \u0026ndash but that is nothing to do with the pay deal it is totally separate.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoTeachers\u0026rsquo pay is a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers  and negotiations for 2018-19 are now well under way and making progress.  An EIS spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAt this week\u0026rsquos SNCT Extended Joint Chairs meeting an amended pay offer was proposed. The teachers\u0026rsquo side of the SNCT will now consider the offer in detail. A further negotiating meeting of the Extended Joint Chairs is scheduled for the September 18, where the teachers\u0026rsquo side will respond formally to the offer."},{"url":null,"title":"home-ownership-a-pipe-dream-for-most-public-sector-workers","story":"  Research by the Unison trade union found that saving money for a down payment on a property would take decades for public sector staff \u0026ndash and more than a 100 years in parts of London.

So far this year five ships on the Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service. On Arran this weekend, the country\u0027s busiest route, one of the two ferries was out of action and the other, the antique MV Isle of Arran, has also had its problems this summer.  The old boat, a beige time capsule, was supposed to be replaced by a new high-tech, environmentally-friendly vessel called the Glen Sannox, but that has been delayed.  The ideal lifespan of a ferry is 25 years but half of them on our routes are older. The average age of ships is 22. In the early 1990s, Scotland\u0027s last burst of ferry building, it was 12.  It\u0027s not as if the Scottish Government is not investing, with over \u0026pound1 billion plumbed into ferry services since the SNP came to power in 2007. Two new ones, delayed by up to a year, are under construction, but this simply isn\u0027t enough to cope with demand \u0026ndash ironically spurred by the Government\u0027s flagship road equivalent tariff, which has kept prices down, and the collapse of the pound after the Brexit vote, which has led to more stay-at-home tourists as well as an influx from abroad taking advantage.  There are no quick and easy solutions. There are no vessels available to buy or rent-in which are available. What is needed is a long-term, planned investment programme for a fleet of standardised ships as well as standardised harbour facilities, so that these boats could be shuffled round the routes. Over to you Holyrood."},{"url":null,"title":"lifeline-to-scotlands-islands-in-jeopardy-as-ageing-fleet-faces-soaring-passenger-numbers","story":"  The 50-year-old heating engineer has been trying to tell how little he thinks of the ferry service to his island. Now he has decided to show it instead.  So he ushers us in the shade behind his white van and brandishes a photo of the empty car deck of an ageing ro-ro. \"They had told us the boat was fully booked,\" he says. \"But it was empty. Computer problems.\"  Mr Higgins is having a picnic lunch on the front at Brodick, Arran\u0027s main port, as another load of tourists in sunglasses, their faces glowing red from sun and sea, trundle hand luggage along its promenade. \"I like to get off the island when the visitors come,\" he smiles, watching them. \"That is not always easy. In the summer you have to book three weeks in advance.\"  It is a brilliant September day, the Firth of Clyde is a flat azure that melts seamlessly in to the sky and Arran is heaving. It has been all season. So are the boats that provide its lifeline links to the mainland. The island is home to just over 5,000 people. Last year 911,434 passengers were clocked on its two ferry routes. That is 20 per cent more than a decade ago. The figures for cars are rising even faster, by 44 per cent from 2007 to total 229,664 in 2017.  This summer traffic \u0026ndash most of it on what is often a two-boat service out of Ardrossan on the North Ayrshire coast \u0026ndash has grown again.  The passengers Mr Higgins watched had passed through a high-tech adjustable gangway and state-of-the-art terminal . But they did so after coming off a boat built in 1984, the MV Isle of Arran. And that is a problem.  The vessel, its interior a beige time capsule of sticky seats and retro puggies, has had problems, more specifically this year, propeller pitch control problems. Cue service disruption, and not for the first time.  The old boat was supposed to have been replaced this summer by a new high-tech environmentally friendly vessel called the Glen Sannox. That ship is delayed. Hence the frustration of Mr Higgins and much the rest of Arran.  Yet this local row \u0026ndash albeit affecting Scotland\u0027s busiest ferry route \u0026ndash is just one symptom of a much bigger problem, a problem that has been a generation in the making.  Simply put, Scotland\u0027s islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old, really old.  There is a mantra in the ferry industry about this crisis. Nobody, insiders insist, is to blame. And nobody, they add, will be able to find a quick fix.  That is because half of the ferries on Clyde and Hebridean routes have seen out their ideal lifespan of 25 years.  The average age of a ship is 22. In the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building , the average age was 12. The number, unchecked, has been rising ever since. In fact, it has been a generation since Scotland, one of Europe\u0027s most \"islandy\" nations, was launching enough ferries to sustain its fleet.  The result? Boats break down. And when they break down they are hard to fix. And our islands suffer.  So far this year five ships on Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service. One, the Hebridean Isles, built 1985, which usually services Islay, has been laid up twice, thanks to damage in rough seas off Tiree and a collision with the harbour at Kennacraig on Kintyre.  Newer ships, such as the MV Clansman, which services the outer Hebrides from Oban, are among those out of action.  Bad things happen at sea that is to be expected. What counts is whether the entire system \u0026ndash fleet-wide \u0026ndash can cope when they do.  Take Calmac. The biggest operator of ferries runs most services to islands and peninsulas in Western Scotland. It is state-owned. Its ferries are owned by another state owned entity, CMAL, which also owns or leases the boats that, under a separate Northlink franchise, service routes to the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  Between January and the end of July this year, some 2,326 out of 79,203 Calmac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because Calmac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  However, a ferry that does not sail is not quite like a bus that does not turn up on time. There are rarely alternatives. And with ferries packed to capacity, alternative travel is not always easily arrangeable.  When a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. Calmac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled, bobbing about at sea waiting to save the day. Indeed, even if it did have a spare, Calmac could far from guarantee it could use it. Why? Every port has its own pecularities, whether it is an ageing linkspan or unusual tide. This is not a standardised fleet. Most ships and ports are bespoke.  Usually Calmac gets the blame. It is the firm with the name on the side of its ships, with their trademark blue hulls and white superstructures. In fact, the firm, which had to compete to secure its franchise from its own government owners, has been warning about a growing problem with its service for years.  Back in 2010 the company bluntly told the Scottish Government that a new ferry would have to be launched every year just to stand still.  In its submission to that year\u0027s ferry review, it said such a drumbeat of production could cut the average age of the fleet from 22 in 2012 to 19.5 in 2022.  Warnings have echoed ever since. In March, Calmac\u0027s chief executive, Robbie Drummond, signalled this summer could be tough. He said: \"Any issues with a vessel on one part of the network will have knock-on effects for other routes, as boats need to be diverted or deployed elsewhere to keep the lifeline network running.  \"Islay has already been adversely affected by such changes this week, with one of the two ferries that normally serve the island needing to be withdrawn to fulfil contractual obligations elsewhere.  \"The working life expectancy of a ferry deployed on routes like those on Scotland\u0027s western seaboard is around 25 years, so with nearly half of the ferries working these routes already beyond that milestone - and having been used intensively during those years of service - the risk of mechanical failures and breakdown is significant.  \"It also takes longer to get older boats back into service when things do go wrong, often due to the difficulty in sourcing parts across Europe.\"  By May there were more grumbles. Mr Drummond, summoned to Holyrood, spelled out the problems again. He told MSPs: \"It remains the case that we have no spare vessels to accommodate this eventuality.  \"It was not a minor breakdown a major vessel has been out for more than two months, and is coming back in for another two weeks while we get back on track.  \"There has been a period of major disruption\u0026mdashthe worst the company has experienced for eight years. We have tried as best we can to provide the best possible service through that period.\"  Key stakeholders are not happy. Outer Hebrides Tourism  reckons it lost \u0026pound6m from service cancellations after the breakdown of one boat. Ian Fordham, its chairman, this week said: \"While the Scottish Government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience, they should also recompense our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a tourist destination after the negative economic impact of this summer\u0027s ferry fiasco. This has hit tourism business not just this summer but its future growth too.\"  It is not as if the Scottish Government is not investing. The current SNP administration has put a cool billion pounds in to ferry services since it came to power in 2007. This includes \u0026pound97m for two new ferries being built for CMAL at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow. The first of these, the MV Glen Sannox, was supposed to go in to service this summer to replace the Isle of Arran but will not start operating until, at current estimates, next summer. A second, now codenamed 802, will run to the Western Isles to help address the OHT\u0027s concerns. It isn\u0027t convinced. Among its other complaints were that two new ferries were delayed \"with nothing else in a build pipeline.\"  \"How they will manage this against the backdrop of traffic and visitor growth to the Outer Hebrides?\" it said.  The boom in visitors was not expected. Some put that down to the Scottish Government\u0027s flagship \"road equivalent tariff\" or RET scheme under which a ferry journey should not cost more than a drive. But other factors are at play: the collapse of the pound after the Brexit vote means more tourists from both home and abroad.  Across the Calmac network, the last five years have been busy. Between 2012 and 2017 the number of cars carried grow by 37 per cent to 1.43m per year. Passenger numbers rose 17 per cent to 5.2 million per year.  Joe Cullinane is pleased with that. He leads North Ayrshire Council, which includes key Clyde ferries, including Arran\u0027s. \"The fleet is too old to meet the demands of RET,\" he says. \"RET is great for the added tourism. But the infrastructure is not ready to cope with RET, our roads, our ports and our ferries.\"  The RET pressure has been hardest on Mr Cullinane\u0027s patch. Tiny Cumbrae, gets more visitors than all of the Western Isles put together. So many, in fact, that there is now routine traffic congestion in the sedate resort town of Largs from where a new hybrid ferry sails. Why? Cars queuing for the hop across the First of Clyde.  The new ferries on order at Ferguson Marine are also hybrids. This vexes some of Scotland\u0027s \"armchair admirals\", the voices berating the decision to invest in new tech, rather than tried and tested conventional ships. The delays to the two new ships have been at least partly put down to the risk of innovation. Some critics have also suggested a quick order could be placed for a cheep-and-cheerful diesel-guzzling chugger in a low-cost shipyard in the Far East. Policy-makers reckon that would just be another stop-gap solution.  The Scottish Goverment quango Transport Scotland asked Calmac and CMAL to look for off-the-shelf boats to buy or lease to fill the gaps. It even suggested that it would pay for them. So couldn\u0027t Scotland just pick up a \"rustbucket\" from the Greek Islands or Norway? No. There are just no vessels out there that would work.  Transport Scotland said it \"continued to invest\" in new ships and ports. Its experts stress that ferries should not be seen as ships in isolation. They are part of a complex system that includes ports and other transport connections. They have to \"fit\".  CMAL had no comment. It has its two new delayed ships on order and then will look to get another, for Islay. The future of Scottish ferries - of Scotland\u0027s islands - now lies in the hands of a document CMAL published in January. The Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan or VRDP is a detailed run-down of what boat should go where for years to come. It\u0027s very last words should be music to the ears of Scottish islanders and visitors. It says: \u0026ldquoConsider the opportunity to develop a medium/large class of major vessel capable of working effectively and efficiently on a number of routes across the network.  What this means is a move to more standardised vessels for big routes, namely from Oban to Colonsay, Islay, Coll and Tiree from Mallaig to Lochboisdale in the Western Isles and Armadale on Skye and from Wemyss Bay on the Clyde to Rothesay on Bute. For standardised ships, these ports will have to have standardised or future-proof harbour facilities built. That is big money. But, crucially, it would mean Calmac could reshuffle its fleet far more easily when something goes wrong.  The VRDP did not say when such plans would be considered. Transport Scotland was able to. It\u0027s next year. A spokesman said: \"The focus of the next vessel procurement will be a new ferry for Islay to replace the MV Hebridean Isles. This will maintain our investment programme, currently focused on the construction of two major vessels for the CMAL fleet and a number of major harbour projects.  \"The development of a medium/large class of major vessel will be considered by Transport Scotland, CMAL and CalMac as part of their programme of work. This is intended to get underway next year.\"  Back on Arran there was more trouble this weekend. The island\u0027s other main ferry, the Caledonian Isles, now exactly 25 years old, was cancelled for technical reasons. Islanders are used to this.  Sheila Gilmore, out walking her cockapoo Archie, was philosophical. Arran born and bred, she now runs the local destination marketing bureau, Visit Arran. \"It is frustrating when you can\u0027t get off the island. We have to get used to that. What we want is to make sure we have two ferries on the main Ardrossan route all year round. Across the network? Resilience is the issue. We need a spare boat.\""},{"url":null,"title":"world-trade-centre-subway-station-reopens-for-first-time-since-911","story":"  Cheers erupted as the first train rolled into the new WTC Cortlandt station.

Mr Still, a professor of crowd science at Manchester politan University, told the Sunday Mail: \"The density of fans appears to be six to seven people per square metre - three times the maximum safe level of about two per square metre.  \"At too high density, any trip, slip or fall means people do not have the opportunity to react safely - and this can have a catastrophic effect.  \"It\u0027s just luck that the outcome wasn\u0027t worse.\"  Chief Superintendent Brian McNulty, divisional commander for Greater Glasgow, said the safety of fans is an \"absolute priority\".

She will tell the TUC Congress in Manchester today: \u0026ldquoIn the 19th century, unions campaigned for an eight-hour day. In the 20th century, we won the right to a two-day weekend and paid holidays.  \u0026ldquoSo, for the 21st century, let\u0026rsquos lift our ambition again.  \u0026ldquoI believe that in this century we can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time to share the wealth from new technology. Not allow those at the top to grab it for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWe need strong unions with the right to go into every workplace - starting with Amazon\u0026rsquos warehouses here in the UK.  Research by the TUC showed that most workers expect only managers and shareholders to reap the benefits of new technology.  However, the survey of over 2,000 workers also found that four out of five employees want to cut their working hours without losing any pay as new technology makes work more efficient.  The TUC believes moves should be put in place to try to cut the working week to four days over the course of this century.  In her speech, Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady accused employers of making staff work unpredictable or unsocial hours because of an \u0026ldquoalways on culture.  She added that too many firms were using technology to treat workers unfairly.  The general secretary said: \u0026ldquoBosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new technology for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWorking people deserve their fair share - and that means using the gains from new technology to raise pay and allow more time with their families.  \u0026ldquoIf productivity gains from new technology are even half as good as promised then the country can afford to make working lives better.  However, while unions believe there are potential gains to be made from new technology, they also have concerns about robots and machinery replacing workers.  A report published earlier this year also warned that the UK is lagging behind other nations in terms of readiness for increased automation.  Pat Rafferty, Scottish Secretary of Unite, has previously claimed that there are positives for workers, but warned against a \u0026ldquonightmare scenario of machines replacing workers and cataclysmic numbers thrown out of work.  Unison have also argued that, while the impact of new technology is sometimes exaggerated by experts, strategies on automation need to be put in place now to ensure workers can transition into other roles.  The Scottish Government has already put a number of steps in place to address the issue, including further investment in digital skills, the creation of a Just Transition Commission, and a plan to provide direct support for additional business research and development."},{"url":null,"title":"why-time-could-be-right-for-tvs-queen-of-calm-to-take-dimblebys-job","story":"  She\u0026rsquos fond of an occasional single malt with ice to help her unwind, or a refreshing G\u0026ampT to perk her up.

That, says former Scottish first minister Jack McConnell,\u0026nbsp  now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, has contributed to the programme losing its way.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos deliberately moved away from a programme that expands the knowledge of the viewer, to one that has attempted to be an entertainment show in which people shout at each other.  In an age when too many media interviews are carefully controlled to produce a line for news, Question Time could play an important role. Instead, it produces zero public benefit in that context.  While reluctant to discuss his friend\u0026rsquos potential role on the programme, his vision of the next presenter is not a million miles away from Wark.  He says: \u0026ldquoThe role needs someone who has authority, who is well-researched and doesn\u0026rsquot rely on research done by a team behind the scenes.

The frustrating reality is that the CCA - which actually comprises 13 businesses and institutions under one banner and roof \u0026ndash currently has no control over its fate, and must watch helplessly as Glasgow City Council and GSA lay responsibility at each other\u0026rsquos door each other for the situation. The fact is, though, while the safety of the west fa\u0026ccedilade of the Mack remains a concern, re-opening presents a challenge for the CCA, especially since the Scott Street door is a fire exit.  Obviously, the council has a legal obligation to keep people safe. But it\u0026rsquos vital now that all parties \u0026ndash including Creative Scotland, which owns the CCA building \u0026ndash come together so that energy can be put into finding creative solutions worthy of this cultural icon that would allow it to re-open, even partially, and begin to rebuild. Apportioning blame wastes time and diverts attention what we need now is focus and action to avert disaster.  I spoke to Mr McKee over the weekend and he put forward three practical solutions that could bring things back from the brink in the short term. The first is access for a plumber and builder to assess and fix a leak that has resulted in a ceiling collapse in the exhibition space. Considering the position of these facilities in the building, accompanied safe access would surely be possible?  The second is a re-assessment of fire exits to allow partial access for businesses and customers. After all, the CCA\u0026rsquos Sauchiehall Street neighbours on either side are already back in business. Mr McKee also suggests a safety canopy over the Scott Street exit for the duration of remaining works to mitigate safety concerns.  The third part of the jigsaw is a date for the opening of the caf\u0026eacute bar \u0026ndash even if it is some way in the future \u0026ndash so insurers can continue to support this busy, buzzy meeting point which supports 32 jobs.  The Scottish Government fund set up in the aftermath of the fire is very welcome and will no doubt help with cash flow to some extent. But in this case money is only part of the problem, as Mr McKee\u0026rsquos sensible suggestions highlight. What appears to be lacking is willingness on the part of its partners and masters to really, truly stand up for this jewel in the city\u0026rsquos cultural crown in its hour of need.  Notwithstanding who or what was to blame for the fire at the Mack, GSA must surely feel some sense of responsibility for the situation and do more to assist, not least by providing some idea of a date for completion of work on the west fa\u0026ccedilade by its contractors. It could also perhaps leverage support from the international arts community for its close friend.  The council, for its part, must find ways around the sort of \u0026ldquocomputer says no attitudes and policies that led to so much criticism over the last weeks and could yet contribute to a slow and painful death for the CCA.

No one realised then, however, that the impact on its neighbours would also be utterly devastating.  You can\u0026rsquot understate the CCA\u0026rsquos contribution to Glasgow\u0026rsquos cultural scene and reputation. But neither can you play down how fundamental GSA \u0026ndash which sits just feet away - has been to this ongoing success. The two organisations share not only an outlook, networks and ideas, but personnel. A significant number of the CCA staff and many who exhibit there are students or former students of the art school.

But Nick initially thought it was his brothers Chris  and Martyn  pulling his leg during their honeymoon!                                       \t      \t\tWedding day...just a week after their wedding in August 2017, Nick and Philippa Allan received a call on honeymoon that a donor had been found. Nick said he would be eternally grateful to his donor and their family for giving him a new life.      \t                                                             Nick , from Echt, explained: “Philippa and I had been out in Pitlochry during the day and went back to the hotel for a meal. I’d put my phone on silent and forgot to turn it back on.                                                    “So they called Philippa and said I needed to get to the hospital in Edinburgh.        “My brothers said they were going to wind me up on our wedding day or honeymoon so I thought they were just kidding on.“But when I checked my phone, I had a lot of missed calls from a mobile number.                                       \t      \t\tWe Need Everybody...is the message from Organ Donation Scotland during Organ Donation Week 2018, from September 2 to September 9. The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

/                   \t      \t\tProtecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect. The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.                "},{"url":null,"title":"payment phone line down for almost a month","story":"        A north-east MSP has appealed to the Rural Economy Secretary after it emerged a phone line to help farmers navigate government payments has been down for almost a month.                Peter Chapman has said that calls are being diverted from the Rural Payment and Inspection Division  office telephone line at Thainstone, Inverurie, to Elgin.                                                    This has led to delays while calls are then transferred back to Inverurie or problems for farmers getting through at all as the lines are too busy.                                                    Mr Chapman was contacted by a constituent in Aberdeenshire who has expressed his frustration at the problem.        It is understood that the fault relates to a fallen phone line near Thainstone.The rural payment offices provide information to farmers about application forms that need to be filled in for grants and payments to meet strict deadlines.Peter Chapman, Scottish Conservative MSP for the north-east region, said: “I was contacted by a farmer constituent of mine who has raised concerns about this problem, which has been going on for nearly a month.“This is causing problems both for local farmers and for the Elgin office, which I gather is being inundated with calls.                                                                                                        “Farmers are being kept waiting for long periods of time to be connected, while staff in Elgin do not know if those in Inverurie are present to deal with the call.“It is important that people can reach their local office as quickly as possible, as very often application forms are subject to strict deadlines.“I have written to the Rural Economy Secretary seeking some information on when this issue will be resolved and also some assurance that the Scottish Government is making sure the Thainstone office can accept local calls.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"play facilities to be installed at kingseat","story":"                Aberdeenshire Council will carry out work to form a community park and install play equipment, after the initial developer of the site, Avant Homes, failed to install the facilities as required.                                                     The work had been a condition of the planning permission agreed for the site and late last year the council served planning enforcement notices to try to get the work moving.                                                     Other than preliminary works there has been no significant progress from the developer or landowner, so the council will begin work on site from Monday  to deliver the park and play area and seek to recoup the cost.         The lack of community facilities at Kingseat has been an ongoing concern for the local community and Councillors for a number of years.The enforcement notices were served in connection with two breaches of planning control, relating to the storage of spoil/materials and the lack of a play park. The focus is on a fenced-off central area of the site where there was previously a bowling green and open space area within the former hospital complex. This was intended to form part of the open space/facilities for residents within the completed development. Avant Homes had 12 weeks from October 20, 2017 to clear the spoil storage area and create a new open space area, including play equipment.                                                                                                         The notices were not appealed by the developer and the period for compliance expired on February 12.Since then the site has changed ownership to ZTR Investments and Aberdeenshire Council gave the new owners time to comply with the notices, while making alternative arrangements. Aberdeenshire Council\u0026rsquos Head of Planning, Robert Gray, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough some preliminary clearing work was undertaken by the new owners there has been no significant progress in forming the park or installing the play equipment.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Monday 10 Sep 2018 10:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Monday 10 Sep 2018 10:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He is now communicating via email with both his work coach at JobCentre Plus, and his Fair Start Scotland Adviser. Within the 12 weeks of attending Fair Start Scotland, not only can Alan now use Microsoft Outlook, but he has completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and has been applying online for employment.In all the group workshops that Alan attends, he socialises very well with the other participants and is very cheerful. He thinks the service is going very well, and is enjoying it. Alan is very happy with the progress he has made, and has noticed the improvement in his confidence.Alan seems to be talking so much more, which may have been a barrier stopping him from getting into work. He was pleased to inform his Fair Start Scotland adviser that he got a job working 15 hours a week.Alan said: “I’ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills at Lochaber Hope.

Finalists will also receive feedback from some of the region\u0026rsquos top entrepreneurs and business advisers on how to take their idea forward.Run by Create, the UHI\u0026rsquos Centre for Enterprise and Innovation, the competition is now in its 13th year and is open to all students studying at the UHI as well as non-students living in the Highlands and Islands, Moray and Perthshire.Last year the competition attracted more than 115 entries. This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Monday 10 Sep 2018 10:53 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We\u0026rsquoll ensure an open competition for all bidders whether public or private sector organisations.\u0026ldquoWe expect the current franchise to end in 2025. The tendering process will begin two years before that.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartMonday 10 Sep 2018 10:53 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Peter Dipnarine has lived in the Capital for 14 years with his wife and three children who all face deportation after their visas expired in November 2016.            As a result they have been unable to get fixed-term employment and are unable to fork out the “ridiculous” £7,000 fee needed to secure their future in the city for the next two-and-a-half years.            Five applications to waive the fees to renew their visas have been rejected by the Home Office with a sixth now submitted in the hope of getting the green light. The close-knit family faces being ripped apart if they are ordered to leave the country with Peter, wife Claire, both 57, and son Rene, 27, are of Trinidad and Tobago citizenship while daughters Chantal, 22, and Marie, 16, are citizens of the United States.As a last resort to raise awareness, son Rene began an online petition which is now just 5,000 supporters away from reaching 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a debate in parliament.Peter told the Evening News: “We are all worried and are scraping by each month to afford to pay the rent and for food to live off. We are being treated like illegal immigrants and we want this to go to parliament.“We are wanting to raise awareness of the situation we’re in because there certainly are others in a similar predicament. Paying £7,000 every two-and-a-half years is not realistic for a family of five. We feel the fees need to be reduced so they are affordable for immigrants. It is clear discrimination.”            The family is now subject to immigration bail with conditions to reside at their Drylaw home and report to their local police station every 12 weeks. The Dipnarines moved to Edinburgh in 2002 after 12 years in Miami, Florida.Up until the expiration of their visa, Peter and Claire were working endlessly, mostly in administration. Now the pair have resorted to doing odd jobs in order to pay the rent and put food on the table but Peter is worried at how much longer they can continue with their lives filled with uncertainty.Peter added: “We simply have no funds available to pay for the ridiculous visa fees. We’ve only just enough money at the moment to scrape by. “We want to work but we can’t without the visa.             “My wife and I have always worked and we’ve had jobs at places such as Edinburgh University and NHS Education for Scotland. I have been private tutoring, sourcing car parts or clearing containers. You don’t know how difficult it is looking for something to do each day when I’m a father just wanting to provide for my family.”The family sent in a separate application for Edinburgh Napier network systems student Rene in June which is still being considered by the Home Office. Meanwhile there is still hope for digital media student Chantal whose application is still being considered despite the family not paying the required fees.Peter added: “We should not be treated like this, especially when children are involved.  Edinburgh is our home and we don’t want to go because we love it here.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “When setting fees, we also take into account the wider costs involved in running our border, immigration and citizenship system, so that those who directly benefit from it contribute to its funding. This reduces the burden on taxpayers. There are exceptions to application fees to protect the most vulnerable, such as for young people who are in the care of a local authority.  Application fees are also waived where evidence provided shows that a person may be destitute, or where there are exceptional financial circumstances, and requiring a payment would result in a breach of rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.”To sign the petition go to www.change.org/p/home-office-save-my-family-being-torn-apart-from-deportation"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797430.1536570450!/image/image.jpg","title":"former rbs board member gets behind wheel at aston martin","story":"        Aston Martin, the iconic British sports car maker gearing up for a stock market listing, has appointed former Royal Bank of Scotland director Penny Hughes as its chairman.

Hughes said: “I am looking forward to becoming chair of the board upon the proposed listing of Aston Martin Lagonda.“I am impressed by the turnaround that has been achieved by the team under the leadership of chief executive Andy Palmer and excited by the group’s future.“Private shareholders have displayed successful long-term stewardship to date and are fully committed, as am I, to transitioning the group, the board and its governance arrangements to those expected of a world-class public company operating from the UK.”Hughes’ appointment is among a raft of new directorships announced by the maker of the DB11 and Vanquish sports car models.New non-executive directors include former InterContinental Hotels Group chief executive Richard Solomons and former William Hill and Mothercare board member Imelda Walsh.            In a market update, the company confirmed earlier intentions for a stock market flotation in London.President and group chief executive Andy Palmer said: “We are delighted to have attracted high-calibre independent non-executive directors who will be led by Penny Hughes, the proposed new chair of the board.“The independent directors will bring significant experience to the board as we prepare to float and deliver fully on our business plan commitments.”Last month, the firm said it was exploring plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, ending months of speculation about the possibility of going public.            Aston Martin – founded in London in 1913 and headquartered in Gaydon – will float at least 25 per cent of its shares in the listing, and could join the FTSE 100 if the company’s valuation is adequate.Najeeb Al Humaidhi on behalf of the firm’s Kuwaiti shareholding said: “We have had the privilege to be part of the company’s history for the past 11 years.“We remain committed as we continue to support the growth of Aston Martin Lagonda in this next and exciting phase.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797427.1536571393!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon admits to being a bit of a control freak","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Boris Johnson\u0026#8217s political career is littered with scandals entirely of his own creation. The former Foreign Secretary has rare gifts both for causing offence and for walking away unscathed.                No matter how far Mr Johnson goes, he has always been able to depend on his allies in the Conservative party coming to his defence. “Oh, that’s just Boris,” goes the eye-rolling reaction from those who see him as a charmingly roguish figure rather than the ruthlessly ambitious politician he undoubtedly is. When Mr Johnson recently wrote in a newspaper column that Muslim women wearing the burka looked like postboxes, his defenders rubbished the idea his remarks were racially inflammatory. At worst, they said, he had written those words without thinking of the reaction they might illicit.            If this were so, we might expect Mr Johnson to have resolved to more careful about the language he uses in public. An article published under his name in yesterday’s Mail on Sunday suggests he has made no such pact with himself. Mr Johnson wrote that Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy had put the UK in a “suicide vest” and handed the detonator to Brussels. The Tory back-bencher - whose ambition to become Prime Minister appears to burn as brightly as ever - blithely used the sort of language favoured by the extreme-right during the 2016 EU referendum campaign. This was more dogwhistle politics from a man whose instinct to go low rarely fails him. In the two years between the EU referendum and Mr Johnson’s “principled” resignation from Mrs May’s cabinet, he made many public proclamations about how easy Brexit would be while all the time resolute failing to come up with ways in which his stated ambition - a have cake and eat cake Brexit - might be achieved.            Mr Johnson may be skilled in the art of generating headlines but as a serious political figure, he is sorely lacking in the substance required. While he talks of suicide vests and detonators, the bleak reality is the with 200 days until the UK leaves the EU, the shape of Brexit is completely unclear. The sole constant seems to be warnings from industry and the technology and science sectors that Brexit will come at the expense of jobs and vital funding for research. Brexit - a cause of great anxiety for so many in the UK - is no more than a game to Boris Johnson. His latest intervention is proof of that."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797266.1536563777!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith brexit won t lead to scottish independence and here s why","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        SNP Deputy Leader, Keith Brown, and Conservative Secretary for Scotland, David Mundell, have both claimed Brexit could lead to Scottish independence. They are both wrong.                Irrespective of what type of Brexit the UK ends up with, be it a WTO Full Brexit with lashings of Houses of Parliament Sauce, a Canada-plus Free Trade Agreement, or a Chequers-minus deal that delivers Brexit in name only – they are all toxic to the cause of Scottish nationalism.             Brexit is Green Kryptonite, to Keith Brown and Nicola Sturgeon they will be weakened by it, for whatever one thinks of Brexit there is no escaping it makes the case for independence less attractive. Worse still, and despite what Brown and Mundell say, the more calamitous it is the worse independence will look to ordinary voters. If there’s so much havoc leaving the EU what would they expect leaving the UK to be like?            Once we leave the EU on 29th March any benefits accrued to the UK are likely to be lost forever to an independent Scotland seeking to rejoin the EU, while any benefits that once considered worth the high price of EU membership will not necessarily be reintroduced.Brexit benefits should include not facing an annual bill of £10bn – which should deliver a Brexit Bonus for Holyrood of around one billion per annum. It should mean taking back control of our fisheries policy – which will be of greater importance to Scotland to the rest of the UK – as well as shaping agriculture policy to suit the needs of Scottish farmers within the UK’s single market. Further Brexit benefits should include the ability to change our laws about how we trade and apply taxes we should be able to open freeports in Grangemouth and Prestwick that will act as magnets to international duty free assembly – while we can decide to change what items are subject to VAT, what else we tax and at what rate, or what our tariffs for imports might be .Once the UK is outside the EU then the SNP faces the challenge of arguing why it will be easy and painless to extract Scotland from a union of 311 years compared to the calamity it expects from the UK leaving a union of only 45 years. Alex Salmond reckoned Scotland required only eighteen months to exit the UK, yet with no deal yet agreed and a transition period if there is one, it could take five years to leave the EU fully in 2021.Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are £46bn, which is more than its £13bn exports to the 27 other EU states and the £17bn to the rest of the world combined. The Fraser of Allander has put the number of Scottish jobs related to EU exports at 125,000 but for our trade with rUK it estimates 529,000. The threat to our prized financial services economy is existential, with most of their customers being English residents many, if not all, would have to move their HQs and associated operations to Leeds, Manchester or London. If Brexit is tough then independence is off the scale.            Then there is the question of how to get Scotland back into the EU. The first obstacle will be Spain and her allies within the EU. A secessionist Scotland can expect no favours from Spain whatever its political colour and there are other EU members that think the same way. The SNP’s fawning over Catalan separatists will prove to have been a major blunder, even in obtaining EAA status. There’s also the loss of Margaret Thatcher’s Fontainebleau discount on the membership fee that will not be transferable from the UK to an independent Scotland. Indeed Scotland, as part of the UK, is already a net contributor to the EU so it would have to find at least a billion a year  – a difference to the balance sheet of £2bn a year from being in the UK but outside the EU.  If independent, Scotland would already have to find savings or raise taxes to finance its annual public spending deficit of circa £13.5bn, but taking on EU membership costs would ensure extremely painful Scottish austerity is unavoidable.  Then there are the legal requirements of Scotland having its own currency rather that of a country outside the EU – and accepting eventual membership of the euro. Covering that £13.5bn deficit is not an option, for EU membership requires Scotland’s debt to GDP ratio be brought down from an unsustainable 7.9% to no more than 3% within ten years.How “hard” a Brexit the UK has matters too. If the UK settles for importing and exporting on WTO terms then all the problems that critics of this perfectly normal arrangement allege, such as a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be visited upon an independent Scotland, only worse. Brown and Mundell are both experienced enough to know their Brexit comments are nothing more than playing to their respective galleries. For Brown it is about rousing his troops to not lose hope that independence is near. For Mundell it is about circling the wagons around his Prime Minister’s besieged Chequers plan. He’s a remainer Cabinet minister who owes his comfy chair to a remainer Prime Minister.            The truth is the best friend of Scottish independence is not Brexit but Jeremy Corbyn. It is Corbyn who will trade a second independence referendum to achieve power and it is Chequers that will make the Tories unelectable and put him in power. So let’s ignore Mundell and chuck Chequers to save the union."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797298.1536564083!/image/image.jpg","title":"parties unite to deal fresh blow to p1 testing plans","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Controversial tests for five-year-olds in Scotland\u0026#8217s schools are facing renewed pressure to be axed with a motion being laid at Holyrood today calling for their removal.                Labour’s education spokesman, Iain Gray, has lodged the one-line motion which is likely to attract support from all opposition parties.            It now appears to be just a matter of time before a Holyrood vote is held on the issue which the minority SNP Government will almost certainly lose.            The new system of standardised assessments in P1 has already prompted calls for a boycott amid claims that some youngsters have been left in tears and teachers believe them to be a waste of time.Ministers insist that they provide valuable information about youngsters’ development and such assessments have always been held, albeit  not on a national basis.But Mr Gray insisted today that the tests are a “shambles.” He added: “The SNP’s refusal to listen to the mounting evidence against them is bordering on farcical.“Labour will continue to work to build cross-party and non-party opposition to these tests. That is why I have lodged a motion at Holyrood this week calling from the tests to be scrapped for primary 1s.” He added: “Ministers should listen to the sheer number of voices telling them these tests have to go.”            The EIS teaching union, which opposes the P1 tests, has written to opposition parties at Holyrood calling on them to opposing the ban, while the educational charity Upstart has organised a postcard campaign encouraging parents to boycott the tests. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he would support such a boycott at the party’s conference at the weekend.A review of the new Scottish National Standardised Assessments, which were introduced last year and also take place in P4, P7 and S3, has been carried out. Mr Swinney has already pledged changes to the P1 tests. But they will not be axed. A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Standardised assessments are delivered as part of everyday learning and provide consistent evidence for teachers to identify the next steps in a child’s learning, which is especially valuable in the early years if we are to continue to close the attainment gap.” Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Tavish Scott said: “Opposition parties are united in their belief that tests of 4 and 5 year-old-girls and boys in Primary One is utterly ineffectual.

With 200 days until the UK’s scheduled exit from the European Union, Ian Blackford said the single market and customs union represented the “least worst option”.            The SNP’s 35 MPs could be crucial in any cross-party bid to push Mrs May to accept a Norway-style soft Brexit.            The Prime Minister faces a battle to get any sort of Brexit arrangement through the Commons, with her own Conservative Party bitterly divided over her Chequers plan which would see the UK accepting a common rulebook with the EU for trade in goods.READ MORE: Independence group in war of words over cash donations at ralliesMr Blackford said whatever deal is ultimately reached, the infighting will leave the Tories a “deeply damaged party at the end of the process”.He added: “What the Prime Minister must not do is listen to the increasingly frenetic noises coming from the Brexit ultras on the government benches.“While Boris Johnson might be trying to stake a claim to the Tory leadership - an unconscionable prospect - his vision for Brexit would result in significant loss to our economy, jobs thrown on the scrapheap and businesses going bust.            “What Theresa May has an opportunity to do is put remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union back up the agenda.“The least worst option, short of remaining in the EU, which will give us certainty over trade and our position in the global economy.”He said the idea of leaving the EU without a deal “should not be entertained by anyone with a modicum of good sense”.“The PM should get a grip of her party and shut down the rampaging right-wingers who, in talking up that very prospect, are putting their own narrow interests ahead of what is good for Scotland,” he said."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797254.1536508690!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch the swedes can resist the far right","story":"        Is Sweden lurching to the right?                Sunday’s elections will doubtless show a rise in support for the far-right Sweden Democrats . Several opinion polls had placed them second, behind the Social Democrat Party  - Sweden’s traditional party of government - and ahead of the centre-right Moderates.             The prospect of such a political shift has made headlines across the world. Of course, every country is grappling with the same problem - public hostility to immigration in the aftermath of wars in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and beyond. But let’s be honest. There’s also a good deal of schadenfreude about Sweden’s predicament. This country of almost ten million people has created one of the world’s most equal societies since the Social Democrats first came to power in 1917. Whilst other countries like Britain have found it almost impossible to control or regulate capitalism, the Swedes have made big strides. As a result, their income gap is the world’s smallest their childcare and maternity/paternity care are excellent and their elderly care is widely regarded as the best in the world. On a trip to Sweden’s southern province of Skane, industrialist and Swedish Consul to Scotland Torvald Colliander took me to see the council-run old folk’s home where his mother lived and died. He proudly showed me his own name on the application list. “In Sweden,” he told me, “the only fear is that you wont get into the council home and might have to go private instead.” Public services are that good. Consequently, private provision is rare, everyone uses the same school, doctor and dentist regardless of social background and the wealthy keep on paying tax.            So far it’s worked. The Swedes have been the living embodiment of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett’s best-selling book The Spirit Level, which demonstrates that everyone benefits from an equal society – including the rich. Additionally, the Swedes have the highest rates of innovation in the EU and union membership is three times higher than in Scotland. In short, the Swedes have been at the top of every international league table for decades – provoking admiration, envy and outright hostility in almost equal measure.In 1960, American president Eisenhower said Sweden’s welfare state had led the country into an orgy of sex, socialism and suicide.  In fact, Sweden was the only country on earth to rival the GDP of post war America, so it was politically inconvenient to discover that a tiny Nordic nation was evolving a more humane Third Way between the command economy and the unfettered free market.Some of Eisenhower’s mud stuck and over the years, politicians in less equal societies have grown weary of Sweden’s apparently effortless social and economic success. So there’s a smug wee smile now that Sweden’s suffering from  an ugly outbreak of the same racism, intolerance and hostility experienced by other countries with lower standards and more wobbly moral compasses. It seems that under pressure, the Swedes react no better than anyone else. You can almost hear the collective sigh of relief from politicians, TV viewers and even activists.But Sweden’s predicament is not quite so simple.            There is absolutely no parallel between the number of refugees and economic migrants accepted into Sweden and any other country – not in Germany and most definitely not in the UK.In 2015, one in six people living in Sweden was born outside the country. That’s a dramatic change from the almost totally homogenous, white society that prevailed in Sweden until the 1960s. Like the other Nordic nations, the Swedes had no empire, Commonwealth or experience of different ethnicities arriving gradually as economic migrants over a century as Britain did.  Instead, Swedish society changed fairly rapidly – the first influx of refugees came after the Yugoslavian conflict and then in 2014, the country accepted 80,000 mostly Syrian asylum seekers – proportionally more than any other country in Europe. That produced other problems, many of them peculiar to Sweden’s high skills economy. In 2015, 35,000 children arrived in Sweden as asylum seekers without parents. Families in war-torn countries heard Sweden was giving permanent residence permits to all Syrians seeking asylum and many managed to scrape the money together to send over one child apiece. That child was often a teenager, without a word of Swedish.In Britain, by contrast, migrants and asylum seekers arrive with a basic grasp of English and can find casual jobs without qualifications. Essentially, Britain’s world of low-pay, zero-hour contracts, means immigrants can get a start. New arrival in Sweden by contrast, often cannot, which leads to unemployment and housing segregation. Still, the ‘refugee crisis’ is not a part of everyday life. Society hasn’t collapsed and Swedes are still more welcoming to incomers than folk from other EU countries.             According to a Europe-wide survey published last year, 64 per cent of Swedes are positive to immigrants from outside the EU compared to 37 per cent across the EU itself. So the big question is not whether the Sweden Democrats will increase their vote  but whether that gives them any meaningful political clout.  Every other party has rejected the idea of forming a coalition, and whilst that may create awkward bedfellows amongst the other parties, there’s a strong incentive to make common cause. But whilst British voters are quite used to seeing large bodies of political opinion frozen out of power as a result of First Past the Post voting, the Swedes with their fully proportional voting system are not. Will exclusion fuel support for the Sweden Democrats or will mainstream parties cooperate, contain the threat and devise innovative ways to boost integration? Despite support from prominent eugenicists in the Nazi era, far-right ideology did not overtake Sweden in the 1940s. The Swedes can resist it again.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and ied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"familys tearful goodbye to brave cameron truesdale","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

He donated his tumours to research.\n\n\"This meant we had to sacrifice a few hours from him but we pray that it will go on to give more hope for Dipg. Cameron always said he wanted to make sure other kids didn\u0027t have to go through this all and have no options.

who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sea of 175000 sunflowers in northern ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

So Damien thought he\u0027d try throwing sunflower seeds in just to see what would happen.\"\n\nDamien sowed the seeds at the end of April using an old-fashioned fiddle and it seems the traditional methods are the best.\n\nKaren said: \"With a heavy rainfall followed by the long hot summer, we were soon looking up at 175,000 sunflowers.\n\n\"We thought we had to do something with it so we decided to open it up to the public for a couple of days over a weekend to raise funds for our local church and were amazed at how many people came along.\"\n\nThat was five weeks ago and the meadow took off from there.\n\nKaren added: \"On the following Monday, Damien went off to work, but I noticed cars coming along the road, then a minibus. People were still coming to look at the sunflowers. I called him to see what I should do and he said, \u0027let them in\u0027.\n\n\"And now, for five weeks solid, we\u0027ve had visitors from all over Ireland!\"\n\nThe couple and their three children, Cara, Ryan and Therese, watched as their field of sunflowers took on a life of its own and they\u0027ve even had to take on some part-time workers to manage Northern Ireland\u0027s newest tourist attraction.\n\n\"It\u0027s gone crazy on the internet. We\u0027ve now had photo-shoots for magazines, couples coming to have their wedding photos taken, a marriage proposal in the field and now we\u0027re expecting a rock band from Dublin to arrive to shoot a music video,\" Karen said. \n\n\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\n\n\"It\u0027s so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty.\n\n\"The weather has obviously helped with people wanting to get out into the countryside.\n\n\"It\u0027s been a little quieter this week as the schools have gone back, but we\u0027re still seeing people come in to enjoy the surroundings.\"\n\nThe couple have placed seating around the paths to allow people to relax and take in the colourful scene.\n\nKaren added: \"We\u0027ve had all sorts coming but what\u0027s been really wonderful is the respect the visitors have shown for their surroundings.\n\n\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen so many photographs of sunflowers. Our Facebook and Instagram pages have been taken over by them.\n\n\"We had one woman in her 80s who was almost crying. She\u0027d been in France 60 years ago and never thought she\u0027d see a field of sunflowers again. It brought back so many memories for her.\"\n\nWith the meadow only a few miles away from Seamus Heaney country, Karen said she wondered what the poet would have made of the creation.\n\n\"To me it looks like the perfect place to inspire someone like Seamus Heaney. I\u0027d like to think he\u0027d have paid a visit and written about the scene if he was still with us,\" she said.\n\nKaren thinks the sunflowers have another two weeks before her summer of colour comes to an end, so if anyone wants to pop along to their Gortgole Road attraction they\u0027d better be quick.\n\nShe added: \"The weather\u0027s cooling down now and if we start getting frost that\u0027ll be the end of the sunflowers for this year.\n\n\"But we\u0027ve had such a lovely time seeing the smiles on people\u0027s faces that we\u0027ll think about trying it again next year.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"large increase in britons applying for irish citizenship","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And last year saw a massive surge in applications, with 529 British nationals becoming Irish citizens.\n\nToday, 480 people from 68 countries, among them 47 Britons, will take part in a citizenship ceremony at the National Concert Hall in Dublin where they will receive their certificates of naturalisation. Poland, the UK and Romania top the list of the nationalities taking part in the ceremony.\n\nFine Gael senator Neale Richmond said there has been a spike in British nationals becoming naturalised Irish citizens following the Brexit referendum and the uncertainty it has created.\n\n“Already we’ve seen a massive increase in applications for passports by eligible citizens living in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain,” he said. “Now, figures released to me by the Department of Justice have shown that increasingly British nationals living here, who don’t qualify for a passport through lineage, are applying for Irish citizenship.\n\n“There are over 300,000 British nationals living in the State and it is estimated a third would not qualify for a passport through lineage. \n\n“Many are now looking to become naturalised Irish citizens for a host of reasons. This is a good news story and these new Irish citizens should be commended for their decision.”\n\nDemand for Irish passports has soared in Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the wake of the vote to leave the EU. \n\nIt was reported that the number of applications in the first four months of 2018 soared by 25% compared with the figures for the same period in 2016.\n\nAt the time, the Department for Foreign Affairs said the increase was “undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10% of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"my late father would be proud says drew harris after taking up top garda post","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mr Harris  died instantly. His wife survived.\n\nTheir son Drew made Irish history two weeks ago when he was sworn in as the first person from an outside police force to head up An Garda Siochana. He told the Sunday Times it was a moment he felt sure would have made his father \"exceptionally proud\".\n\nHe said: \"My father would have been very proud of me, the way any father would be of their son. \n\n\"He would have always wanted me to do well, to bring up my family, work hard at my job, which was police work.\n\n\"I think he would be exceptionally proud of the position I have attained.\"\n\nMr Harris, then aged 24, had reached the rank of sergeant by the time of his father\u0027s murder. \n\n\"I took about a week off and tried to get back to work and I only lasted a short time, maybe a week, and then I had to take about three weeks off. I went back too quickly,\" he told the Sunday Independent. \n\n\"It was a terrible time. In some ways it remains, for me, beyond description and it has reverberated down through the years as well.\n\n\"I think it actually shapes your approach to humanity and what sort of person you are. I have worked - and certainly worked hard in those early years - to try not to be bitter and I hope I have succeeded in that.\"\n\nHe said he has not forgiven the killers.\n\n\"They never asked for my forgiveness,\" he said.\n\n\"Forgiveness is a two-way street. They never asked for it and I don\u0027t think they ever will. I try to act in effect how my father would have wanted me to, which is actually get on with your life, bring up your family, do well, do the best at your job that you can.\"\n\nHe described the murder as nothing more than a \"practical demonstration of hatred\".\n\n\"All it proved was that they were motivated by hatred and were going to murder through hatred - that\u0027s all it illustrated. It proved no other point. It served no purpose and it has hung over my family and I\u0027ve had to cope with that for 29 years, and even more so for my mother as well,\" he added.\n\nAs well as being the first outsider, Mr Harris is also the first Garda Commissioner to have been advised not to be without armed protection when out and about.\n\nHe said: \"The reality of my policing career is that I\u0027ve been under threat from both republican and loyalist groups. What am I to do? Am I to say, \u0027Okay, well, I\u0027m going to throw the towel in and retreat from public life and it will simmer down\u0027?\n\n\"I\u0027ve chosen not to do that. I\u0027ve chosen to serve and do my public duty in both Northern Ireland and here.\n\n\"I have been out and about throughout the summer, but sensible precautions have to be taken. It\u0027s part of policing. The role of An Garda Siochana is to face down these threats and not be intimidated.\"\n\nMr Harris said he is concerned about the effect of Brexit on policing.\n\nHe said: \"Obviously there will be additional opportunities to those who smuggle.\n\n\"We are alive to these threats.

Mr Ma handed over the CEO post to Zhang in 2013 as part of what he said was a long-planned succession.\n\nMr Ma, a former English teacher, founded Alibaba in 1999 in a flat in the eastern city of Hangzhou to connect Chinese exporters with foreign retailers.\n\n\nJack Ma: “The best thing about Alibaba is that we come together under a common mission and vision. Our partnership system, unique culture and talented team have laid a strong foundation for [our] legacy.” \nhttps:t.co/0aIlp7TbQj\n \npic.twitter/N4fnmZAdro\n\n— Alibaba Group  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIt expanded into consumer retailing, becoming the world’s biggest e-commerce company by total value of goods sold, as well as online finance, cloud computing and other services.\n\nMr Ma, 54, became one of China’s most famous entrepreneurs and one of the world’s richest. The Hurun Report, which follows China’s wealthy, estimates his net worth at 37 billion US dollars .\n\nAlibaba’s 25 billion dollar  initial public stock offering on Wall Street in 2014 is the biggest to date by a Chinese company.\n\n\n\nThis transition demonstrates that Alibaba has stepped up to the next level of corporate governance\nJack Ma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nAlibaba said Mr Ma will remain a member of the Alibaba Partnership, a group of 36 people with the right to nominate a majority of its board of directors. That arrangement limits shareholder control, but Mr Ma has defended it as a way to keep Alibaba focused on long-term development.\n\n“This transition demonstrates that Alibaba has stepped up to the next level of corporate governance from a company that relies on individuals, to one built on systems of organisational excellence and a culture of talent development,” said Mr Ma’s letter.\n\nAlibaba is part of a group of companies including games and social media giant Tencent Holding, search engine Baidu and e-commerce rival JD that have revolutionised shopping, entertainment and consumer services in China.\n\nE-commerce sales in China rose 32.2% last year to 7.2 trillion yuan, accounting for 20% of total retail spending.\n\nAlibaba was founded at a time when few Chinese used the internet. As internet use spread, the company expanded into retailing and services. Few Chinese used credit cards, so Alibaba created its own online payments system, Alipay.\n\nMr Zhang, Mr Ma’s planned successor, joined Alibaba in 2007 after working at Shanda Entertainment, an online games company. He served as president of Alibaba’s consumer-focused Tmall business unit.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bonkers conkers people derry urged keep eyes signs autumn summer heat wave","story":"\nA nature charity has asked the people of Derry to help it collect data on the changing seasons.\n\nSchools across the city have reopened their doors, but a traditional childhood favourite – the conker – is missing from the trees.\n\nThe Woodland Trust claims the sizzling summer heatwave and prolonged drought has caused a delay in ripe conkers appearing on our trees.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, while there have been some sightings of aspiring conkers – the familiar spiny green husks hiding in the branches – no records of ripe conkers have been received.  They’re easy to spot as the horse chestnut will drop the conkers to the ground naturally when they are ripe.\n\nBy recording natural seasonal sings – that’s the first signs of spring and autumn – members of the public are helping to show how climate change is affecting UK plants and wildlife.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe charity is appealing for more people across Northern Ireland to take part in its online project, as records here are relatively scarce.\nMartha Boalch, citizen science officer for the Woodland Trust, says: “We’d really love local people to take part in Nature’s Calendar, so that we can get an accurate picture of how the seasons unfold right across the UK.  And keeping your eyes peeled for conkers is a great place to start.  I’m sure the kids will agree!\n\n“This year’s unusual weather, with a prolonged lack of water, could have delayed the horse chestnut trees producing their fruit and could stop them from growing to their full potential.\n\n“Although we’ve only had a small number of conkers recorded so far, all is not lost for our favourite sign of autumn!  Over the next month we would expect more fruit to ripen, but only time will tell whether it will be a plentiful, or disappointing, crop.”\n\nTo find out more about Nature’s Calendar and to become a recorder, visit naturescalendar.woodlandtrust.org.uk\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dong kids youth events centre derrys culture night celebrations","story":"\nPicture: Local young people pictured at the Nerve Centre where you can witness a one of a kind live recording session where three local young bands will record two original tracks each, crafting a record in the flesh from 6pm - 9pm on Culture Night.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"huge day fundraising events kicks off aid altnagelvins neo natal unit","story":"\nA bumper day of fundraising events is currently underway in aid of Altnagelvin Hospital\u0027s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit.\n\nThe Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park is holding a charity tattoo event and family fun day.\n\nThe Tattoo spaces are now fully booked, however there may be a small number of cancelations.\n\nThere will be a big display of custom motorcycles on show hosted by the Exiles RC and guests from the Dead Society MCC this morning at the Tattoo Lounge.\n\nThe family fun day is also underway with live music from local musicians.

after leaflets were delivered to householders living in the university area of the city advising residents there will be wardens active in the area tasked with dealing specifically with issues involving students’ ‘anti-community activity’.\n\nThe leaflet was issued by the Sinn Féin councillor for the area, Mickey Cooper.\n\nIn the wake of the leaflet drop, Derry Now spoke to residents living in the area about the issue of students and anti-social behaviour.\n\nHowever, many of the residents claimed that incidents related to noise or anti-social behaviour from students living in the area had significantly decreased, which they attributed to ‘dwindling numbers’ of student admissions at Magee University.\n\nDerry Now contacted Ulster University, who confirmed that there had been a ‘decline in overall admissions’ at the Magee campus.\n\nA university spokesperson said that in the past two years, the number of admissions had dropped by 172.\n\n“As part of our commitment to our multi-campus operation we balance student numbers across all campuses,” the spokesperson said\n\n“Full time undergraduate student places at Ulster University, for students from Northern Ireland and the EU, are limited by a Regulated Cap on Student Numbers, set by the Northern Ireland Executive.”\n\n“Enrolment figures for Magee for the last three years showed that there has been a decline in overall admissions with figures for 2015/16 standing at 4,391.\n\n“The enrolment figures for the following year, 2016/17 were 4,338, a drop of 53 student places.\n\n“The figures for the academic year

work through our confirmation and clearing period to provide educational opportunities to new students on a wide range of programmes on the Magee campus.\n\n“Our plans for our Magee campus and the

in line with our broader expansion plans.”\n\nDisciplinary action\n\nIn relation to the issue of anti-social behaviour in and around the university area, the spokesperson said such incidents would not be tolerated.\n\nAn Ulster University spokesperson said: “Ulster University is proud of our role in the community and the positive contribution our talented students make to society, but we do not tolerate anti-social behaviour and have robust disciplinary processes in place to deal with any incidences, as and when they are reported to us.\n\n“We will be working with students from the start of the academic term to underline the impact of anti-social behaviour, both on the local community and on future career prospects.\n\n“We work closely with the PSNI on a range of initiatives who also join us each year in giving presentations to our students on the consequences of anti-social behaviour.\n\n“We will fully investigate all reports made to us by the authorities and begin disciplinary action where we have the necessary evidence to do so.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new multi disciplinary gp service create 200","story":"\nDerry has been announced as one of two areas in the north

derry kids avoid dreaded back school germs","story":"\nAs the new school year gets under way, the Public Health Agency  is raising awareness amongst Derry parents about the importance of good hygiene – both in school and at home.\n\n“Schools can be a common breeding ground for germs and bugs so it is important to take steps to reduce the risk of picking up or spreading germs to others,” said Dr Philip Veal, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA.\n\nParents and schools can help reduce the spread of germs by encouraging kids to practise good personal hygiene by washing hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before eating.\n\nYou should also make sure your child carries tissues at all times and teach children to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and to use a tissue which is disposed of quickly and carefully in a bin\n\nTeach children it is good to share, but not to share drinks, food or lip balm.\n\nMake sure your child receives the free flu vaccine if they are eligible\n\nThe PHA also suggests using an alcohol-based hand gel or wipe when hand washing is not possible, such as at school events or during field trips.\n\nThe spread of infection can also be reduced by thoroughly cleaning lunchboxes each day and supervising children as they regularly clean out their schoolbags. Use a wet cloth or wipe to remove dripped liquids and food crumbs from schoolbags.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nIt is also important to keep children at home from school if they are sick.\n\n“Bugs and germs are often found in school and these can be easily passed from child to child,” said Dr Veal.\n\n“Effective hand washing is one of the most important tools in preventing many illnesses. Clean hands are vital in controlling the spread of infections and other illnesses such as food poisoning and seasonal flu. By following some simple steps we can help to avoid illness.\n\n“A great way for kids to learn about how these infections can spread is using e-Bug, a series of fun online games for primary and

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
