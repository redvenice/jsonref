(Picture: AP)Theresa May said today she had authorised British forces to conduct precision air-launched cruise missile strikes on Syria to degrade its chemical weapons capability – adding that there ‘was no other choice’.Four Royal Air Force Tornado jets using Storm Shadow missiles had taken part in the attack on a military facility near Homs where it was assessed Syria had stockpiled chemicals, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.It came after intelligence indicated Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government was responsible for an attack using chemical weapons in Douma last Saturday.The Prime Minister said the missile strike was designed to minimise any civilian casualties and was not an attempt to change the Syrian government.In a statement, she said: ‘This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.’Smoke rises in Syria after US-led airstrikes targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus (Picture: SANA AP)Britain’s defence ministry said initial indications were that the precision weapons and meticulous target planning had ‘resulted in a successful attack’May said Britain and the West had an obligation to deter both Assad and others from using chemical weapons after the poison gas attack in Douma near Damascus killed up to 75 people including children.‘So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,’ she said.The Western missile strikes demonstrate the volatile nature of the Syrian civil war, which started in March 2011 as an anti-Assad uprising but is now a proxy conflict involving a number of world and regional powers and a myriad of insurgent groups.A picture released by the French Defence audiovisual communication and production unit (ECPAD) shows the launching of a cruise missile from a French military vessel in the Mediterranean sea towards targets in Syria overnight (Picture: AFP)US President Donald Trump said he was prepared to sustain the response until the government of Assad stopped its use of chemical weapons.Russia, which intervened in the war in 2015 to back Assad, has denied there was a chemical attack and has accused Britain of helping to stage the Douma incident to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.Man, 66, urinates on schoolgirl on bus in DerbyBritain’s defence ministry said ‘very careful scientific analysis’ had been applied to maximise the destruction of stockpiled chemicals while minimising any risk of contamination to surrounding areas.‘The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk,’ the MoD said in a statement.May said while the strike was targeted at Syria, it sent a message to anyone who used chemical weapons.Syrian soldiers hold their weapons as they dance and chant slogans against US President Trump during demonstrations following a wave of US, British and French military strikes to punish President Bashar Assad for suspected chemical attack against civilians (Picture: AP)Britain has accused Russia of being behind last month’s nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, southern England, a charge Moscow has rejected.‘This is the first time as prime minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat and it is not a decision I have taken lightly,’ she said.‘We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.’Many politicians in Britain, including some in May’s own Conservative Party, had called for parliament to be recalled from a break to give authority to any military strike.RAF Tornados taking-off on a sortie at RAF Akrotiri to conduct strikes in support of Operations over the Middle East (Picture: PA)Former Prime Minister David Cameron lost a parliamentary vote on air strikes against Assad’s forces in 2013 when 30 Conservative lawmakers voted against action, with many Britons wary of entering another conflict after intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya failed to bring stability to the region.May is not obliged to win parliament’s approval before ordering military action, but a non-binding constitutional convention to do so has been established since a 2003 vote on joining the US-led invasion of Iraq.Firefighters are using own phones to get to jobs as satnavs keep failingA YouGov poll this week indicated that only a fifth of voters believed that Britain should launch attacks on Syrian military targets and more than two-fifths opposed action.Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had said Britain should press for an independent U.N.-led investigation into the suspected chemical attack in Douma rather than wait for instructions from Trump on how to proceed.Former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, now head of humanitarian relief group the International Rescue Committee, said military action needed to be part of a wider political strategy.‘Bombing cannot substitute for diplomacy,’ he said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/17/4A5E4E4300000578-5595315-image-a-15_1523291174738.jpg","title":"Chloe Moretzs parents declared bankruptcy debts 5 487 891","story":"    Chloe Moretz\u0027s family lost everything when her parents declared bankruptcy in 2005, DailyMail.com can reveal.

By this point in the month the number is lower than hoped for.\u0027She added that the tussle between the warm air from the South and the wet weather in the West - which will bring rain to most places on Sunday - will finally be won by the continental influence on Monday.Ms Kent said temperatures in the south-east could hit 59F (15C) or 61F (16C) at the start of the working week.She said: \u0027By Tuesday across London we could see 18C (64F), maybe 19C (66F). By Wednesday, there\u0027s still going to be some patchy rain in parts of the north-west but England and Wales will have this continental air coming in.\u0027So, dry weather for them, plenty of sunshine again. Temperatures on Wednesday will again be highest in the South East. London could see between 20C and 23C.             \u0027And in fact, going further north, places like York could see 18C to 20c. And, even for Glasgow, it could be 17C or 18C on Wednesday.\u0027Ms Kent said: \u0027The trend into the end of the week is to continue this feed of warmer continental air across England and Wales. \u0027Those frontal systems are always trying to battle into the north-west, so it could be cloudier there with some more mixed weather at times.\u0027But, by the end of the week, in the that far south-eastern corner we could see temperatures into the low to mid-20s.\u0027Ms Kent said that these temperatures will be above the average for mid April.

They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her  nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him. I don’t deny it, I don’t like him.\u0027I realised what he was when he married my daughter in 2004. She’s got a very greedy husband,\u0027 he told the judge.Alvin David, Mrs Wamsteker’s brother and Mr David’s son, who lives in New Maldon with his family, outside court valued the property, jewellery and money claims being brought by his father against his sister at around £1m. The hearing continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/08/04D7E4AB000007D0-0-image-m-5_1523518559531.jpg","title":"Horrific moment female worker","story":"\u0027Guardian angel\u0027: Alexander Vysotsky is being hailed as a hero in Russia after he stepped in to save 28-year-old Ekaterina, right, from an \u0027attempted rape\u0027 The footage shows the victim bravely resisting, backing away towards the door and even grabbing the blade of the knife.He is seen forcing her  to the ground and pulling at her skirt. We\u0027ve got a dossier too!

Fortunately the guides had drilled it into our heads that if anything happens, don\u0027t run, don\u0027t run!\u0027After about an hour-and-a-half we came out of forest and looked up and about 100 metres away saw an elephant at the top of a little hill. \u0027We stopped immediately admired it and then suddenly it charged us.\u0027Mr Larsen continued: \u0027Dean our lead guide said, \u0027Don\u0027t move!\u0027, so we stood there frozen in terror as the elephant charged down the hill at us.\u0027 I\u0027m a pretty calm person. I don\u0027t yell and scream in a car crash. But I was scared to death.\u0027Straight away Dean had moved forward and become the target. He put his arm up and yelled \u0027Whoooa!\u0027 and about 10 metres away the elephant stopped dead in its tracks. \u0027It was unbelievable. It looked like something out of a cartoon. His front feet dug into the ground in a cloud of dust. I could not believe what I was seeing.\u0027With his right arm raised Dean was loudly commanding the elephant and it backed off. It was surreal.

You could see it was angry and meant business.\u0027After the third time the elephant moved off and all I could think of then was get us out of here.\u0027I watched it, relieved, and thought I looked like a child stomping off because Dean hadn\u0027t let it get its own way. \u0027It was flapping its ears and throwing sand over its back.

Bristol Crown Court (pictured) heard Ah\u0027Kiell had suffered brain injuries potentially caused by shaking, and may have been immersed in waterA post-mortem examination found Ah\u0027Kiell\u0027s death was caused by a lack of oxygen to his brain, with a pathologist also finding four older fractures to his ribs and a fracture to his shoulder.Jurors have been told that Walker was \u0027obsessed\u0027 with Ah\u0027Kiell\u0027s constipation and fed him water through bottles with the teat cut to increase the flow.Accounts given by Walker and Henry in police interviews do not explain his injuries, prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC said.Following the death, officers examined phones used by Henry and Walker.They revealed that Henry had told friends she wanted to end her relationship with Walker by the time Ah\u0027Kiell was nine or 10 weeks old.During the same period, internet searches were made on Walker\u0027s phone including \u0027shaken baby syndrome\u0027, \u0027can I squeeze my baby\u0027, \u0027internal bleeding due to trauma\u0027 and \u0027baby broken ribs\u0027.One search, on June 14, asked: \u0027Can babies feel pain?\u0027, followed by \u0027baby burst liver\u0027.Henry, of Tuffley, Gloucestershire, and Walker, of Lansdowne Green, London, deny all the charges against them."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/18/4B123D1100000578-5613355-There_are_many_theories_regarding_the_provenance_of_the_term_420-a-23_1523639963813.jpg","title":"What 420 weed day","story":"    420 is an unofficial celebration of cannabis when people rally and call for its legalisationOrigins of 420Many people erroneously believe that the term 420 is a reference to several things including: the police code for the drug in the US the number in the California penal code that is about the distribution of marijuana the deaths and anniversaries of various celebrities including Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Bob Marley the number of chemical compounds in cannabis.They are not: 420 is not even a code in the NYPD or the LAPD. San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

Occasionally, she’ll be a-ish if she’s asked to do anything she doesn’t want to. On one shoot, she had to wear a silly Christmas hat and I could tell she wasn’t best pleased.She does this thing where it sounds like she’s muttering under her breath. When she had the hat on, she turned to one of the young boys sitting next to her and ‘muttered’. It was hilarious.And sometimes she likes to keep people waiting to get that great shot.

Roo, a five-year-old Dalmation, lives with Stephen Smythe, 65, a retired company director, and his wife, Carola, 63, in Central LondonIt wasn’t the first time that someone had told us we had a good-looking dog. It was my daughter who suggested I sign her up to a modelling agency. She’s done a variety of campaigns for brands such as Cath Kidston, Sainbury’s and McDonald’s. Photographers tell us that her contrasting markings make her very attractive: she’s not too black and not too white.The Cath Kidston shoot was particularly crazy because it involved more than 30 dogs recreating a scene from 101 Dalmations to promote a range of black and white clothes. Funnily enough, Roo’s grandmother actually starred as one of the 101 dogs in the 1996 version of the film.Roo took it all in her stride and we even bumped into her brother, which was a rather sweet moment.We don’t treat her as any kind of superstar: she’s simply our family pet who we treat occasionally to the odd grooming session at the vet. She’s well-behaved on shoots, apart from the time she had a little accident on the floor of a studio.It was my fault as I’d been rushing around all morning and had forgotten to let her do her business.Another time, she vomited after eating a huge bowl of food that was being photographed alongside her.

He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, Berkshire. Bronia says:It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star. I was appearing in panto with him and it was around the time that Pudsey the dog had won Britain’s Got Talent. Shane thought it would be funny to ‘do a Pudsey’ and get Archie to perform ‘tricks’ with him. Shane would then swap him for a toy dog and pretend that Archie was flying across the stage. The children in the audience couldn’t believe their eyes, but the adults were in fits of laughter.          Archie is an eight-year-old West Highland terrier. He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, BerkshireAfterwards, I sent Archie’s details off to the PetLondon modelling agency. He did a huge campaign for the pet charity PDSA last Christmas and his face was plastered all over the Tube and railway stations, and he was on television, too.We get around six jobs a year and every time we are booked for a shoot I ask if the client wants his fur long or short. Some people like them to look a bit fluffier.We give him a bath before each shoot, which he enjoys, and use a lovely coconut shampoo on him so his fur comes out ice-white.Once, when we did a shoot for Boden, we had to travel to London in the pouring rain and arrived with Archie looking like a drowned rat. The styling team thought it was hilarious that he sat there, quite happily, while I used a hairdryer on him and he fluffed up in no time.Terriers are often quite excitable but Archie’s a professional and he’ll often fall asleep while waiting to be called. I keep bits of chicken with me to encourage him to behave.If I use the word ‘Walk’, he will tilt his head in a very cute way. Sometimes he’s booked for jobs simply for that tilt of the head.  \u0027It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star.

He lives with owner Nicola Kazan, 33, a dog groomer, her husband Tufik, 33, a tailor, and son Theo, five, in Eton, Berkshire. Nicola says:Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’. There are not many red poodles in the UK, particularly in this apricot shade, so it’s no wonder he feels special.He’s a stud dog from the Czech Republic and originally belonged to my friend. One of her other poodles didn’t get on with Edward, so I asked if I could have him. He’s loving, intelligent and likes to be the centre of attention.Someone at ITV needed a red poodle for a show and got in touch after seeing Edward’s picture on Instagram. I then contacted the Urban Paws agency.          Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’Edward loved modelling from the very start. He’s appeared in various fashion campaigns, but the most high-profile is Stella McCartney.It was the Chinese Year of the Dog and her team wanted beautiful dogs to model her clothes. I’d never dressed Edward up in any outfits, but I said we’d give it a go.Edward couldn’t get enough of the fuss and attention. At one stage, he had two stylists preening and primping him and was wearing a gold dress that was easily worth more than £1,000.Then something caught his eye and he started racing around the studio. My heart stopped. I thought he’d ruin the dress — but he soon calmed down and we got some gorgeous shots.Once a week, I will shampoo and condition him, then dry him and make sure there are no knots. It takes around 45 minutes each time and he loves being brushed. He stands still like a statue.The money he earns varies, but usually it’s around £400 a day. I’m not allowed to say how much we were paid for the Stella job but I used £200 of it to treat Edward to a teeth-cleaning session at the vet.  Edward is a four-year-old miniature ‘red’ poodle.

Tom Ford has pet wire fox terriers, so we think that’s the reason Humphrey was chosen.The shoot wasn’t without its stresses for me. Humphrey is just a regular dog — he doesn’t do any tricks — and I had no idea how he’d behave. But he has such a lovely temperament and immediately bonded with everyone on set.His ‘instructions’ were to follow the male model around his flat as he got dressed for a night out, but at one stage Humphrey had to sit still. To keep him in one place, I had to hide behind the sofa, holding my hand out and saying: ‘Stay, Humphrey, stay.’ Thankfully, he did.At one point, he had to follow the model to the door when the doorbell rang. I didn’t think he’d do it, but he did — and got a round of applause from the team.Dogs are supposed to know their place, but now that he’s a high-end fashion model, I think Humphrey may get ideas above his station.Archie, Roo and Iraida provided by PetLondon – www.petlondonmodels.com   \u0027Ever since Humphrey was a puppy we’ve been stopped in the street by strangers asking if they can take his photograph.

Housing minister Dominic Raab faced criticism after he claimed net immigration had added 20 per cent to house prices in 25 yearsThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government used a model developed by the University of Reading, which found the increase in the number of immigrants living in England between 1991 and 2016 had added an extra £11,000 to average prices, in real terms.But leading economist Jonathan Portes criticised the model, saying it was ‘worse than the back of an envelope’.Mr Raab last week passed his concerns on to the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which is to publish a report to help the Government formulate new immigration plans.

This means that immigration accounts for 21 per cent of the population-related increase on house prices.Rises in average incomes were responsible for a 150 per cent increase in house prices.The Ministry of Housing was forced to publish the figures to back up its claim that immigration had driven up house prices after the UK statistics watchdog demanded to see its modelling.

At the same time you can’t just airbrush the costs and the impact it has on housing.’But Mr Portes, a professor of economics at King’s College London, said the model was not reliable. He added: ‘This is worse than amateurback of envelope – I’m genuinely shocked the ministry would publish this.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/00/44F5977900000578-0-image-m-20_1523662699341.jpg","title":"NINE Cabinet ministers making 10 000 year renting properties","story":"    Jeremy Hunt was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interestsNine cabinet ministers including Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are making a fortune renting out properties, it was revealed. The Secretary of State for Housing, Sajid Javid, is also among the group of politicians raking in more than £10,000 from flats and houses they own. It comes after Mr Hunt failed to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he later rented out.  He was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interests. A spokesman for No 10 said: \u0027Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the Ministerial Code.

SNP first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not believe the reprisals would help bring peace.However, splits within Labour ranks were laid bare with some MPs breaking cover to support the PM.

In a statement, the PM said the decision was one she had not taken lightly and was done in the national interest. Four RAF Tornados took off from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in the early hours and struck regime facilities linked to the production and use of chemical weaponsThe attack was focused on regime facilities linked to the production and use of chemical weapons. Declaring his support, French President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the United States and Britain have launched a military operation against the Syrian government\u0027s \u0027clandestine chemical arsenal.\u0027Macron said in a statement on Saturday that France\u0027s \u0027red line has been crossed\u0027 after a suspected chemical attack last week in the Syrian town of Douma.He says there is \u0027no doubt\u0027 that the Syrian government is responsible.          Smoke could be seen rising after the overnight airstrikes that targeted military facilities in the Syrian capital, Damascus          The British missions against targets in Syria were launched the RAF Akrotiri base near Limassol on Cyprus in the early hoursMacron added the operation is limited to Syria\u0027s abilities to produce chemical weapons, and would not give details about what equipment is involved in the operation or what sites it is targeting.   Despite the ferocity of the Allied strikes, Syrian air defences claim to have shot down 13 missiles fired in the attack, Syrian state TV said. The missiles had been shot down in the Kiswah area south of Damascus.Shortly after the strike, the MOD released a statement, stating: \u0027The UK element of the carefully coordinated joint action was contributed by four Royal Air Force Tornado GR4s. \u0027They launched Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility – a former missile base – some fifteen miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to keep chemical weapon precursors stockpiled in breach of Syria\u0027s obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. \u0027Very careful scientific analysis was applied to determine where best to target the Storm Shadows to maximise the destruction of the stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area. The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk.          French President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the US and Britain had launched a military operation against the Syrian government\u0027s \u0027clandestine chemical arsenal\u0027\u0027Detailed analysis of the effectiveness of the strike is currently underway, but initial indications are that the precision of the Storm Shadow weapons and meticulous target planning have resulted in a successful attack.\u0027Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \u0027The reason we have taken this action is because we all saw the images last week of the suffering that had been inflicted on innocent men, women and children, and there has been a need to act.\u0027That\u0027s why last night we deployed four Tornados armed with Storm Shadow cruise missiles. \u0027You will be pleased to hear all of those crews have returned safely and every early indication is that is has been a highly successful mission.\u0027This is something we have been in discussion with the US and French over the last few days but obviously the meeting of Cabinet is where this was properly discussed.\u0027Mr Williamson said the service personnel involved in last night\u0027s attack have played \u0027an important role in terms of degrading the Syrian regime in using chemical weapons in the future\u0027. \u0027The reprehensible use of chemical weapons in Douma is further evidence of the Syrian regime\u0027s appalling cruelty against its own people.\u0027We will not stand by whilst innocent civilians, including women and children, are killed and made to suffer.\u0027The international community has responded decisively with legal and proportionate military force. Let these united actions send a clear message to the regime – the use of chemical weapons is categorically unacceptable and you will be held to account.\u0027    US Defense Secretary James Mattis says the US and its allies have taken \u0027decisive action\u0027 against Syrian chemical weapons infrastructure.Mattis briefed reporters at the Pentagon Friday an hour after President Donald Trump announced the strike.Mattis said the United States, along with France and the United Kingdom, struck because Syrian President Bashar Assad \u0027did not get the message\u0027 when the U.S. launched airstrikes after a chemical attack in 2017.The defense secretary said Friday\u0027s strikes have \u0027sent a clear message\u0027 to Assad and his \u0027murderous lieutenants.\u0027Mattis said the strikes are \u0027directed at the Syrian regime\u0027 and they have \u0027gone to great lengths to avoid civilians and foreign casualties.\u0027Mattis said the U.S. has no reports of suffering any losses during the initial airstrikes on Syria Friday. Mattis said \u0027right now this is a one-time shot\u0027 but is not ruling out further attacks. President Donald Trump had said earlier that the campaign against the regime of Bashar Assad could be \u0027sustained.\u0027The defense secretary says the airstrikes were launched against several sites that he says helped provide Assad\u0027s ability to create chemical weapons.Mattis said he is \u0027absolutely confident\u0027 that Syrian President Bashar Assad is behind the alleged chemical attack on his people that the U.S. and allies retaliated against Friday night.He says the U.S. is \u0027very much aware of one of the chemical agents used.\u0027 And he says there may have been a second.        Yesterday details emerged of a Cabinet meeting the PM held on Thursday where she won the backing of her ministers to proceed without a parliamentary vote.She told Cabinet: \u0027Since 1918 we have worked to uphold the international norm that chemical weapons are abhorrent and must never be used. In recent years that international norm has been eroded and that should be a matter of deep concern to us all. The use of chemical weapons should not go unchallenged.\u0027The Prime Minister said Britain had to act in order to restore that norm, because the weapons inflict human misery. Downing Street sources said she made the point that these weapons had been used a number of times in Syria – and also in Salisbury.          \u0027These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster instead,\u0027 Mr Trump said referring to Assad (pictured)The need to restore international norms was shared by the whole Cabinet, Downing Street sources said. They said: \u0027Cabinet have been impressed that from the off she has been very robust and very clear. She was the most hawkish.\u0027Russia\u0027s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, held a press conference at his residence accusing Britain of peddling myths about Russia\u0027s activities.At one point he compared allegations that the Syrian government had gassed its own people to Tony Blair\u0027s claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.He also suggested the alleged use of chemical weapons was a hoax and may have been used to discredit Assad. The Russian embassy in the UK said: \u0027Military strikes may be used to cover up all the evidence, or lack thereof, on the ground.\u0027Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the military had \u0027proof that testifies to the direct participation of Britain in the organising of this provocation in eastern Ghouta\u0027.          Theresa May\u0027s statement in full \u0027This evening I have authorised British armed forces to conduct co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian Regime\u0027s chemical weapons capability and deter their use.\u0027We are acting together with our American and French allies.\u0027In Douma, last Saturday a chemical weapons attack killed up to 75 people, including young children, in circumstances of pure horror.\u0027The fact of this attack should surprise no-one.\u0027The Syrian Regime has a history of using chemical weapons against its own people in the most cruel and abhorrent way.\u0027And a significant body of information including intelligence indicates the Syrian Regime is responsible for this latest attack.\u0027This persistent pattern of behaviour must be stopped – not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons.\u0027We have sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to achieve this.\u0027But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted. Even this week the Russians vetoed a Resolution at the UN Security Council which would have established an independent investigation into the Douma attack.\u0027So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Regime.\u0027This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.\u0027It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties.\u0027And while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian Regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity.\u0027At this time, my thoughts are with our brave British servicemen and women – and our French and American partners – who are carrying out their duty with the greatest professionalism.\u0027The speed with which we are acting is essential in co-operating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations.\u0027This is the first time as Prime Minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat – and it is not a decision I have taken lightly.\u0027I have done so because I judge this action to be in Britain\u0027s national interest.\u0027We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.\u0027We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.\u0027History teaches us that the international community must defend the global rules and standards that keep us all safe.\u0027That is what our country has always done. And what we will continue to do. \u0027                                                          President Trump\u0027s Friday night address My fellow Americans: a short time ago I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both. Tonight I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of the Syrian air force.Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians, this time in the town of Douma near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by the very terrible regime. the evil and despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster, instead. Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power -- military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran and to Russia I ask, what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants and murderous dictators. In 2013 President Putin and his government promised the world they would guarantee the elimination of Syria\u0027s chemical weapons. Assad\u0027s recent attack and today\u0027s response are the direct result of Russia\u0027s failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully some day we\u0027ll get along with Russia and maybe even Uran, but maybe not. I will say this, the United States has a lot to offer with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria the United States with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS.America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria. Under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home and great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It\u0027s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of World War I, more than 1 million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly specter return. So today, the nations of Britain, France and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria.

But it was at that point when he hit the floor.Morelli argued that the audience doesn\u0027t get to see the \u0027chaos\u0027 going on behind the scenes, where people are hurried. He said a confluence of events caused his client to fall and be injured - running in a dark area, following an unknown route, encountering an unknown incline, and dust and debris due to construction in the area.MGM Grand\u0027s attorney Jerry Popovich told the jury that Cox simply missed a step when he fell and did not slip.

I have serious reservations - why was the PM not prepared to listen to all sides? Why has the PM sidelined Parliament and instead taken orders directly from Donald Trump?\u0027Emma Lewell-Buck said: \u0027Theresa May had no right to launch these attacks without any cohesive or strategic plan to bring peace in Syria or stop the use of chemical weapons. \u0027In matters of such great importance and in the face of public opposition a parliamentary debate and vote was vital.\u0027 Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \u0027As an elected representative of the people of Ashton Under Lyne I was frozen out of the decision our PM has made to bomb Syria. \u0027I am still concerned as to how our action will stop the use of chemical weapons and bring peace.\u0027 Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner said the UK \u0027should not be associated with Trump\u0027 and suggested the PM feared losing a vote in the Commons. \u0027Many, like me, are not convinced that the world is a safer place this morning.

He tells  Charlotte Higgins about student revolution and how his quantum leap began with an acid trip• Extract from Carlo Rovelli’s new book: on the elastic concept of time What do we know about time? Language tells us that it “passes”, it moves like a great river, inexorably dragging us with it, and, in the end, washes us up on its shore while it continues, unstoppable. Time flows. It moves ever forwards. Or does it? Poets also tell us that time stumbles or creeps or slows or even, at times, seems to stop. They tell us that the past might be inescapable, immanent in objects or people or landscapes. When Juliet is waiting for Romeo, time passes sluggishly: she longs for Phaethon to take the reins of the Sun’s chariot, since he would whip up the horses and “bring in cloudy night immediately”. When we wake from a vivid dream we are dimly aware that the sense of time we have just experienced is illusory.Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist who wants to make the uninitiated grasp the excitement of his field. His book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, with its concise, sparkling essays on subjects such as black holes and quanta, has sold 1.3m copies worldwide. Now comes The Order of Time, a dizzying, poetic work in which I found myself abandoning everything I thought I knew about time – certainly the idea that it “flows”, and even that it exists at all, in any profound sense.We meet outside the church of San Petronio in Bologna, where Rovelli studied. (“I like to say that, just like Copernicus, I was an undergraduate at Bologna and a graduate at Padua,” he jokes.) A cheery, compact fellow in his early 60s, Rovelli is in nostalgic mood. He lives in Marseille, where, since 2010, he has run the quantum gravity group at the Centre de physique théorique. Before that, he was in the US, at the University of Pittsburgh, for a decade.He rarely visits Bologna, and he has been catching up with old friends. We wander towards the university area. Piazza Verdi is flocked with a lively crowd of students. There are flags and graffiti and banners, too – anti-fascist slogans, something in support of the Kurds, a sign enjoining passers-by not to forget Giulio Regeni, the Cambridge PhD student killed in Egypt in 2016.“In my day it was barricades and police,” he says. He was a passionate student activist, back then. What did he and his pals want? “Small things! We wanted a world without boundaries, without state, without war, without religion, without family, without school, without private property.”He was, he says now, too radical, and it was hard, trying to share possessions, trying to live without jealousy. And then there was the LSD. He took it a few times. And it turned out to be the seed of his interest in physics generally, and in the question of time specifically. “It was an extraordinarily strong experience that touched me also intellectually,” he remembers. “Among the strange phenomena was the sense of time stopping. Things were happening in my mind but the clock was not going ahead the flow of time was not passing any more. It was a total subversion of the structure of reality. He had hallucinations of misshapen objects, of bright and dazzling colours – but also recalls thinking during the experience, actually asking himself what was going on.“And I thought: ‘Well, it’s a chemical that is changing things in my brain. But how do I know that the usual perception is right, and this is wrong? If these two ways of perceiving are so different, what does it mean that one is the correct one?’” The way he talks about LSD is, in fact, quite similar to his description of reading Einstein as a student, on a sun-baked Calabrian beach, and looking up from his book imagining the world not as it appeared to him every day, but as the wild and undulating spacetime that the great physicist described. Reality, to quote the title of one of his books, is not what it seems.He gave his conservative, Veronese parents a bit of a fright, he says. His father, now in his 90s, was surprised when young Carlo’s lecturers said he was actually doing all right, despite the long hair and radical politics and the occasional brush with the police. It was after the optimistic sense of student revolution in Italy came to an abrupt end with the kidnapping and murder of the former prime minister, Aldo Moro, in 1978 that Rovelli began to take physics seriously. But his route to his big academic career was circuitous and unconventional. “Nowadays everyone is worried because there is no work. When I was young, the problem was how to avoid work. I did not want to become part of the ‘productive system’,” he says.Academia, then, seemed like a way of avoiding the world of a conventional job, and for some years he followed his curiosity without a sense of careerist ambition. He went to Trento in northern Italy to join a research group he was interested in, sleeping in his car for a few months (“I’d get a shower in the department to be decent”). He went to London, because he was interested in the work of Chris Isham, and then to the US, to be near physicists such as Abhay Ashtekar and Lee Smolin. “My first paper was horrendously late compared to what a young person would have to do now. And this was a privilege – I knew more things, there was more time.”The popular books, too, have come relatively late, after his academic study of quantum gravity, published in 2004. If Seven Brief Lessons was a lucid primer, The Order of Time takes things further it deals with “what I really do in science, what I really think in depth, what is important for me”.Rovelli’s work as a physicist, in crude terms, occupies the large space left by Einstein on the one hand, and the development of quantum theory on the other. If the theory of general relativity describes a world of curved spacetime where everything is continuous, quantum theory describes a world in which discrete quantities of energy interact. In Rovelli’s words, “quantum mechanics cannot deal with the curvature of spacetime, and general relativity cannot account for quanta”.Both theories are successful but their apparent incompatibility is an open problem, and one of the current tasks of theoretical physics is to attempt to construct a conceptual framework in which they both work. Rovelli’s field of loop theory, or loop quantum gravity, offers a possible answer to the problem, in which spacetime itself is understood to be granular, a fine structure woven from loops.String theory offers another, different route towards solving the problem. When I ask him what he thinks about the possibility that his loop quantum gravity work may be wrong, he gently explains that being wrong isn’t the point being part of the conversation is the point. And anyway, “If you ask who had the longest and most striking list of results it’s Einstein without any doubt. But if you ask who is the scientist who made most mistakes, it’s still Einstein.”How does time fit in to his work? Time, Einstein long ago showed, is relative – time passes more slowly for an object moving faster than another object, for example. In this relative world, an absolute “now” is more or less meaningless. Time, then, is not some separate quality that impassively flows around us. Time is, in Rovelli’s words, “part of a complicated geometry woven together with the geometry of space”.For Rovelli, there is more: according to his theorising, time itself disappears at the most fundamental level. His theories ask us to accept the notion that time is merely a function of our “blurred” human perception. We see the world only through a glass, darkly we are watching Plato’s shadow-play in the cave. According to Rovelli, our undeniable experience of time is inextricably linked to the way heat behaves. In The Order of Time, he asks why can we know only the past, and not the future? The key, he suggests, is the one-directional flow of heat from warmer objects to colder ones. An ice cube dropped into a hot cup of coffee cools the coffee. But the process is not reversible: it is a one-way street, as demonstrated by the second law of thermodynamics.Time is also, as we experience it, a one-way street. He explains it in relation to the concept of entropy – the measure of the disordering of things. Entropy was lower in the past. Entropy is higher in the future – there is more disorder, there are more possibilities. The pack of cards of the future is shuffled and uncertain, unlike the ordered and neatly arranged pack of cards of the past. But entropy, heat, past and future are qualities that belong not to the fundamental grammar of the world but to our superficial observation of it. “If I observe the microscopic state of things,” writes Rovelli, “then the difference between past and future vanishes … in the elementary grammar of things, there is no distinction between ‘cause’ and ‘effect’.”To understand this properly, I can suggest only that you read Rovelli’s books, and pass swiftly over this approximation by someone who gave up school physics lessons joyfully at the first possible opportunity. However, it turns out that I am precisely Rovelli’s perfect reader, or one of them, and he looks quite delighted when I check my newly acquired understanding of the concept of entropy with him. (“You passed the exam,” he says.)“I try to write at several levels,” he explains. “I think about the person who not only doesn’t know anything about physics but is also not interested. So I think I am talking to my grandmother, who was a housekeeper. I also think some young students of physics are reading it, and I also think some of my colleagues are reading it. So I try to talk at different levels, but I keep the person who knows nothing in my mind.”His biggest fans are the blank slates, like me, and his colleagues at universities – he gets most criticism from people in the middle, “those who know a bit of physics”. He is also pretty down on school physics. (“Calculating the speed at which a ball drops – who cares? In another life, I’d like to write a school physics book,” he says.) And he thinks the ision of the world into the “two cultures” of natural sciences and human sciences is “stupid. It’s like taking England and iding the kids into groups, and you tell one group about music, and one group about literature, and the one who gets music is not allowed to read novels and the one who does literature is not allowed to listen to music.”The joy of his writing is its broad cultural compass. Historicism gives an initial hand-hold on the material. (He teaches a course on history of science, where he likes to bring science and humanities students together.) And then there’s the fact that alongside Einstein, Ludwig Boltzmann and Roger Penrose appear figures such as Proust, Dante, Beethoven, and, especially, Horace – each chapter begins with an epigraph from the Roman poet – as if to ground us in human sentiment and emotion before departing for the vertiginous world of black holes and spinfoam and clouds of probabilities.“He has a side that is intimate, lyrical and extremely intense and he is the great singer of the passing of time,” Rovelli says. “There’s a feeling of nostalgia – it’s not anguish, it’s not sorrow – it’s a feeling of ‘Let’s live life intensely’. A good friend of mine, Ernesto, who died quite young, gave me a little book of Horace, and I have carried it around with me all my life.”Rovelli’s view is that there is no contradiction between a vision of the universe that makes human life seem small and irrelevant, and our everyday sorrows and joys. Or indeed between “cold science” and our inner, spiritual lives. “We are part of nature, and so joy and sorrow are aspects of nature itself – nature is much richer than just sets of atoms,” he tells me. There’s a moment in Seven Lessons when he compares physics and poetry: both try to describe the unseen. It might be added that physics, when departing from its native language of mathematical equations, relies strongly on metaphor and analogy. Rovelli has a gift for memorable comparisons. He tells us, for example, when explaining that the smooth “flow” of time is an illusion, that “The events of the world do not form an orderly queue like the English, they crowd around chaotically like the Italians.” The concept of time, he says, “has lost layers one after another, piece by piece”. We are left with “an empty windswept landscape almost devoid of all trace of temporality … a world stripped to its essence, glittering with an arid and troubling beauty”.More than anything else I’ve ever read, Rovelli reminds me of Lucretius, the first-century BCE Roman author of the epic-length poem, On the Nature of Things. Perhaps not so odd, since Rovelli is a fan. Lucretius correctly hypothesised the existence of atoms, a theory that would remain unproven until Einstein demonstrated it in 1905, and even as late as the 1890s was being written off as absurd. What Rovelli shares with Lucretius is not only a brilliance of language, but also a sense of humankind’s place in nature – at once a part of the fabric of the universe, and in a particular position to marvel at its great beauty. It’s a rationalist view: one that holds that by better understanding the universe, by discarding false beliefs and superstition, one might be able to enjoy a kind of serenity. Though Rovelli the man also acknowledges that the stuff of humanity is love, and fear, and desire, and passion: all made meaningful by our brief lives our tiny  of allotted time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6466bed5c1442745758198465dff697f6a46f075/253_37_2007_1204/master/2007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ee7b925803d0444dbe730860c8b5b2fc 1240w","title":"safeguards trampled on mps vote syria caroline lucas","story":"By refusing to engage parliament Theresa May has shown contempt for parliamentary democracyThe launch of military action in Syria is a deeply troubling move. And the fact that the timing seems to have been dictated at least in part by a prime minister running scared of a parliamentary vote is little short of scandalous.By refusing to engage parliament on the issue, Theresa May has shown a contempt for parliamentary democracy, and trampled over an important safeguard against unwanted military action.As a result, we’ve found ourselves rushing headfirst into striking a foreign nation alongside a trigger-happy US president when there is little evidence to suggest that our actions will make a positive difference, and much to suggest that they could make matters worse. To intervene militarily before Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors have even been able to investigate the site is also deeply concerning.The risks of escalation are real. Only on Friday the UN secretary general said “the cold war is back with a vengeance”. Russia has already threatened to attack the “source” of any missiles aimed at Syria – and I fear mission creep leading to any attempted “regime change” imposed by the west.Look at Libya, at the rise of Isis in Iraq, at the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan – the long-term impacts of our recent military interventions are a bloody stain on our country’s record. Syria is a tinderbox, the theatre for proxy wars by numerous different actors, and is already deepening the tensions between Israel and Iran. To drop bombs on Assad without a serious, thought-out strategy, and a plan about what happens next, risks making a horrific situation even worse. Even if early indications are that the regime, Russia and Iran will shrug this off in military terms, they will certainly milk it for propaganda and make the search for peace even harder. There is, of course, much that we can be doing. We should be cracking down on Russia through further sanctions and pursuing diplomatic channels. It’s worth noting that US sanctions against Russia are finally beginning to have an effect. New US sanctions on seven oligarchs, 17 top officials and 12 companies led to tens of billions of dollars in losses on Russian markets within just a few hours on Monday, and the rouble recently suffered its biggest daily fall in over three years. We now need to double down on these actions.And Britain urgently needs to get its own house in order if we want to be a positive influence on the world stage. That means ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia, standing up to the aggression of the Israeli government and playing our part as a nation of peace building.The attacks may have already started, but some semblance of democracy must now be restored. Theresa May must bring a debate and, crucially, a vote to parliament on Monday – and give MPs an unwhipped say on these strikes.

So why doesn’t the government do more to support families?This is a tale of two boys. Jack is 15, casually racking up detentions and in danger of flunking his GCSEs. Tharush is the same age, but sits conscientiously doing extra maths on a Friday night while his classmates are out partying. But it’s also, at least in part, a tale of two parenting styles. Jack’s mum seems lovely but works long hours, and can’t face a long row over the homework he doesn’t do when she gets home. Tharush’s mum escaped civil war in Sri Lanka by stowing away in a container for 18 hours, afraid she would die, and is now determined her boy should make the most of chances she didn’t have. For BBC2’s fly-on-the-wall experiment, Living with the Brainy Bunch, Jack moved in with Tharush’s stricter parents while his equally disengaged classmate Hollie M went to live with the school’s head girl and her family, who enjoy challenging each other to name Shakespeare plays over supper.Spoiler alert: after six weeks of early bedtimes, beadily supervised homework and other wholesome activities, both guinea pigs’ scores on a maths GCSE paper improved. Bonus question, for an extra five marks: discuss what, if anything, that proves.Strictly speaking, of course, it wasn’t meant to prove anything but merely to dramatise what decades of rather more rigorous research shows, namely the extraordinarily powerful influence of parental involvement on children’s attainment. It’s debatable how much is nature or nurture, and which precise bits of parenting make a difference. But there’s a broad consensus around the usefulness of things such as reading to small children, setting routines and boundaries, ensuring teenagers get enough sleep, eating dinner together, and showing you take schoolwork seriously.Obviously, that’s infinitely easier if a parent’s own life is comfortable and unstressed you try emulating the Waltons while simultaneously being evicted from a rented flat, or hiding from a violent ex, or even being too exhausted by your newborn to prise the iPad from its older sibling’s hands.But beyond the extremes are plenty of children like Jack and Hollie who aren’t traumatised or on the breadline but hover on the borderline of a GCSE pass or fail, and could be doing better. That’s the territory explored by a new wave of education telly that also includes Channel 4’s Class of Mum and Dad – about a group of parents sent back to primary school – and Indian Summer School, following five struggling British boys packed off to a strict overseas boarding school. All three are a reminder that home environments, and what they mean for expectations of schools, are curiously under-discussed.On the right of politics, any suggestion that teachers can’t be expected both to teach and simultaneously compensate for anything missing at home is rejected as the bigotry of soft expectations. Liberals meanwhile worry about sounding judgmental or snobby, even though self-indulgent parenting transcends class ides: think of the pushy private school parent who can’t believe their little darling’s D-grade might be his own fault for not revising, and blames the teachers instead of pondering his work ethic.But talk to teachers, and you hear about the endless time spent parenting the parents, never mind the kids: breaking up fights between grown adults in the playground, explaining that it’s probably best not to let kids stay up till 3am playing Xbox or instantly take their side in every dispute. We are expecting schools to solve problems created at home while simultaneously cutting the very things – from early intervention projects to children’s mental health services – that might help. If politicians want educational standards to keep rising inexorably that means investing in family life, too.State intervention in parenting has an admittedly chequered history. Sure Start is the standout example of focusing on children’s early development while tacitly recognising how much of that flows from helping parents parent but in some neighbourhoods it was colonised by parents who didn’t need it, and results could be patchy. David Cameron’s troubled families programme was overhyped, underfunded and presented unnecessarily confrontationally by politicians as punishment for “bad” parents, although on the ground it did some decent work in places. The longer school days introduced by inner-city academies, so pupils could do homework in school supervised by teachers, were a practical recognition that for some school is the only relatively quiet, safe place they know, but there’s a limit to how long they can be on the premises.There’s no silver bullet. In some cases it will be about lifting financial stress on families, in others about changing behaviour – including supporting those parents who are doing their best who desperately want to help their kids, but struggle with the legacy of their own schooldays. Class of Mum and Dad was full of them, from the dad who kicked instantly against the rules to the woman who fled a maths test designed for 11-year-olds in tears because she couldn’t do it, and turned out to have been bullied as a child. It left you wondering why routes back into adult education aren’t better linked with schools when wanting to be able to help with your own child’s homework is such a powerful motivator. Could schools become gateways to lifelong learning, offering refresher sessions after hours to parents unfamiliar with the bus-stop method for ision (ask an eight-year-old) or even night classes leading to qualifications?The surprisingly good-natured exchanges between Jack and Hollie’s parents and their host families, and the friendships forged between the kids, hint meanwhile at the importance of peer mentoring. Advice is easier to swallow from someone in the same boat than from an official lecture.But the final step in other cases is parents ourselves taking responsibility for what we do or don’t do: recognising that schools can’t work miracles, that blaming teachers for things beyond their control is unfair and demoralising. It’s time this debate moved off the telly and into real life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51bb3c7bbeeb9686e8c187845226de381ae5058c/447_442_6024_3614/master/6024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74d40fd8cea88f19e524a6c7687ec155 1240w","title":"british museum director hartwig fischer there are no foreigners here the museum is a world country","story":"The German art historian reveals plans for an extensive revamp at Britain’s most visited attraction, but won’t be drawn on calls to return plundered worksHartwig Fischer, who took over the directorship of the British Museum from Neil MacGregor two years ago, has no decoration on the plain blue walls of his office. There are glass-fronted bookshelves. There ia a desk and chairs and two enormous sash windows looking out on to the great forecourt. (Or, more immediately, on to what some staff call the “Bake Off tent” – the ugly temporary structure through which visitors must currently pass for security checks.) But there is nothing to signal Fischer’s taste – nothing like the glimmering wall sculpture by El Anatsui that MacGregor had nothing like the array of Staffordshire pottery that Tristram Hunt displays in his office at the V\u0026ampA no equivalent to the Paula Rego that Maria Balshaw favours in her lair at Tate. There is only a reproduction of a Cycladic figure on the fireplace, a leftover from the MacGregor years, and, on his desk lamp, a tiny figurine of Sai Baba, a spiritual master revered as a saint, which Indian friends gave him.Instead, he says, he prefers to concentrate on the people who come through his doors – and the great treasure house of the museum. But the blankness of his working space radiates through his personal manner: he is warm and friendly, but oddly remote. His employees contrast the charismatic immediacy of MacGregor, who had the disconcerting habit of plonking himself down by random staffers in the canteen and interrogating them about their work, with this more distant figure, who speaks softly and carefully, who glides modestly around the galleries, who is sphinx-like in his statements. But for all that, he is quietly formidable, and has vast ambitions for the museum – plans that will, if they see the light of day, transform the museum for generations to come.Fischer, 56, who came to London after running the state museums in Dresden, is aiming to put the museum, in all its shopworn grandeur, through a major renovation project that will culminate in a complete redisplay of its galleries. That doesn’t sound so remarkable until you begin to absorb the scale of the job. When I joke that it can’t be as big as the Palace of Westminster’s renovation, which will cost at least £3.5bn, he tells me that the museum has more rooms than parliament – 3,000 versus 1,100 – and that the state of the essential services, such as electricity, gas and water are in dire need of repair, just as they are at Westminster. He has in mind something as grand and decisive as the “projet grand” Louvre, which saw the building of IM Pei’s dramatic pyramids and cost between F6bn and F7bn (around £780m at 1993 prices). Or the recent renovation of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which saw the institution closed for a decade and a bill of €375m.Unlike Amsterdam, though, Fischer says: “We cannot close the museum. It’s entirely out of the question.” The British Museum is the most visited attraction in Britain, with 5.9m visitors last year. Work will have to be phased. It will take years. As for even a vague price tag, he is not to be drawn: assessments are still being carried out. And who will pay? Clearly, there will have to be the mother of all fundraising campaigns. But Fischer carefully notes that the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum were renewed “with the support of their governments”. What Fischer hopes to achieve by the end of all this is a display that is more coherent – and more interconnected. That means reshuffling the Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections so that they are not scattered between two floors as they are at present, and also finding ways to show that, as Fischer puts it, “human history was driven and has always been driven by exchange, by cultures communicating”. The interconnectedness he is keen to demonstrate might also be across time: towards the end of our interview we go over to the museum’s big exhibition space, where a stunning show on Rodin and ancient Greek sculpture is being installed. It’s the first exhibition to have been largely developed under his leadership, and its approach – looking at how an artist was shaped by his understanding of the past – might prove a hint at the shape of the programme to come.It’s an intriguing time to be considering the renewal of the British Museum – one of the world’s few so-called “encyclopedic museums” – as Fischer puts it, “a museum of the world for the world”. But Britain is on the brink of Brexit, turning its face away from Europe. When I ask Fischer if he would have taken the job had it been offered on 24 June 2016, he says: “Yes, without any hesitation whatsoever.” This contrasts to the view taken by the late Martin Roth, his predecessor at Dresden, whose resignation from the V\u0026ampA in September 2016 was said to have been hastened by disillusion at the referendum.The museum’s job, Fischer says, is to take the long view, to confront the whole of human history, to understand that Brexit is a moment in the turbulent story of the world. But at the same time: “Everyone who knows me knows I come from a European background and that Europe, as it developed after the catastrophe of the wars is something very important and precious to me. The museum has a lot to offer to help people to contemplate and reflect on what the right decisions should be without taking a direct political stance. It’s there as a space to think, reflect, debate.” It is true that Fischer could hardly be more European. He was raised in Hamburg, studied in Italy and France, and has worked in Switzerland as well as Germany his wife is a psychotherapist in Paris. It’s easy to imagine what his personal views might be, even if for now, they are cloaked in civil service neutrality. He simply says: “Whoever comes in here and crosses the threshold is not a foreigner. There are no foreigners here. This is a world country, this museum. While at the same time we recognise that this is a British creation, to which the cultures of all the world have contributed.”Contributed, yes – but not always willingly. The museum’s collection is inextricably entwined with Britain’s dark imperial past. Increasingly, nations want their objects back: not just the Greeks and the Parthenon sculptures, but others – there is a longstanding claim from Ethiopia, for example, about works of art plundered from Maqdala after its capture by the British in 1868.It’s all very well, I suggest, talking of the museum as an international project, and even as a space where international co-operation between colleagues can continue when formal diplomatic ties are strained. (Fischer made a visit to Iran in December when we meet, he has just returned from Egypt.) But the buck stops for many with the objects themselves, with the fact of possession and ownership. “When you go to see the Parthenon sculptures,” he says, “you can read about the different views, the conflicting views, and we respect different views.” Respecting views is one thing, but keeping the objects is another – that’s the line drawn right there, isn’t it? “It is a line. But what’s been created here is a major contribution to humanity. So while I respect these views, I always say what has been created here, which is open to everybody, creates an extraordinary opportunity to see cultural heritage in a context you have in only a very few places. That is the museum’s major value and it is very precious.”Fischer has come into this environment from the relatively easier circumstances of Germany, where government support for culture, though under recent pressure, is understood as a given, not fought over tooth and nail every step of the way. One of the things he is really passionate about is a music festival he has organised it will see everything from Ligeti and Nono to Japanese temple music performed in the museum’s galleries. “I’ve always worked with musicians in museums,” he says. “When you look at things listening, you look at things differently. The ears make you see more, and the eyes make you hear more.” Ironically, the festival, which is organised in partnership with the Dresden museums, is being paid for by the German foreign ministry. Still, what impresses him in London, he says, is his staff’s passionate sense of public mission. “You would never think about doing something in this place before asking who it is for. You would never get lost in an intricate scholarly debate without coming back to that question: ‘How is our public going to profit from this?’ And I cherish every day working in this environment.”The music festival Europe and the World: a Symphony of Cultures, runs from 16 to 29 April.

What was it, and where did it come from?Mark Sawyer has worked for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution for nearly 30 years, and since 2001 he’s been the full-time coxswain at the Eastbourne lifeboat station. Shortly after 5pm on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend last August, he received a report from the coastguard in Southampton about an incident at a beach seven miles west of his station. “The call we got was that there had either been a fire or an explosion at Birling Gap, and they’d got 50-plus casualties suffering from smoke inhalation or burns.” There was what looked like a layer of thick smoke hanging just above the sea.Birling Gap is a popular National Trust spot between Beachy Head and Seaford, a dip in the chalk cliffs of the Seven Sisters, with a steel staircase leading down to a pebble beach. At low tide there is sand and rockpools on the cliffs above there is a visitor centre, cafe, car park and coastguard station.By 6pm that Sunday, the beach had been evacuated and a major incident declared, and Eastbourne district general hospital was carrying out one of the biggest mass decontaminations in NHS history.The gas or vapour appeared to come rolling along the shore from the east. “We could see this yellowy haze in the air,” a member of the Eastbourne coastguard team says. “It was almost like the film The Fog.” (The fog of John Carpenter’s 1980 horror brings with it the malevolent ghosts of drowned sailors.) Others describe it as clear, or blueish, or sandy. In the frenetic smartphone footage from the scene it looks like a vapour, with a yellow tint, though this might be an effect of the low, late-afternoon sun. It was reported variously as having an odour of chlorine, ammonia and burning plastic. Others say it had no odour, but more of a taste, a chemical astringency in the throat. “We’ve got the water-treatment works near the harbour,” Sawyer says, “but that’s a different smell, I can assure you. The fishermen used to say if the wind’s in the right direction, you can smell your way back to Eastbourne.” A taxi driver who had been nearby at the time says with disarming certainty that it smelled of “potash and corpses”.Meanwhile, Sawyer and his RNLI colleagues were approaching Birling Gap from the east, in their lifeboat Diamond Jubilee. It had been an exceptionally busy 24 hours for the station, even by the standards of a hot bank holiday weekend. Just after midnight a car had been driven over Beachy Head, close to Birling Gap, and the RNLI had spent the morning at the scene. Around 11am, having been up much of the night, the crew was called to recover a body that had been spotted by a fishing boat. That afternoon they also undertook one of the RNLI’s lesser-known roles, the scattering of ashes at sea. They were flagging when the call came in about Birling Gap.“As we were leaving, the coastguard told us they were getting unconfirmed reports that people were suffering from the effects of a poisonous gas,” Sawyer says, as we sit in his office overlooking Eastbourne’s Sovereign Harbour. “As we went towards the west we could see this haze, and all of a sudden our eyes started to burn and you could feel the back of your throat burning. We were told in no uncertain terms, ‘Get into the wheelhouse and shut the doors.’”It took a while for Laura Knight, a drama therapist from Brighton, to realise anything was wrong. She had been on the beach since about 2pm, with her partner and two children, aged six and nine. They were planning a barbecue. “The height of the tide at that time meant the beach was quite thin, and everybody was crammed on the shingle. We had a little swim, everyone was enjoying the sun, and then we started noticing that people were coughing and their eyes were streaming.” It resembled a dense, morning sea mist, she says. “It started slowly to come in, then you lost sight of the cliffs.”Later that afternoon, Eastbourne’s Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, was at Cork airport in Ireland, waiting for a flight home after a weekend break, when texts started coming in about the haze. “So I make some calls and I learn a ‘poisonous gas cloud’ has materialised at Birling Gap,” he says. “I thought, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ With all the fear around terrorism, you just don’t know. I spoke to someone at the hospital and they said, ‘People are coming in we don’t know what it is.’ They were scrabbling around in the dark.”Sussex police, who coordinated the response on land, received the first call about the event at 5.08pm. It came not from a member of the public but from an officer who had been given the information by the RNLI. As the makeup of the cloud was unknown, and reports of symptoms were coming in from a wide area, a forward control point was set up just over a mile from Birling Gap, at the Beachy Head car park. Police, firefighters, ambulance crews and the coastguard convened. Within an hour the police had released a statement advising residents in the area to stay inside, with doors and windows closed. By 5.30pm, the coastguard and RNLI had started evacuating three miles of coastline between Birling Gap and Eastbourne.“By this time a lot of people had left the beach,” Knight remembers. “Then we saw the fire brigade arrive with full protective gear on – head to toe in masks, goggles – and everyone else was semi-naked. I started to really cough, I could feel it in my chest. My eyes were burning. Then of course the anxiety gets you. The children started seeing police officers and my son was really concerned about the animals, the sheep. He was saying, ‘What’s going to happen to all the farm animals, Mummy, is someone going to move them?’ Had it hit a busy beach like Brighton, it would have been a major, major incident.”At 6pm patients started arriving at Eastbourne hospital, not only from Birling Gap but also from the wider Eastbourne area. They were complaining of streaming eyes, coughing and sore throats there had also been reports of vomiting. “We work on a 1-2-3 rule,” says chief operating officer Joe Chadwick-Bell. “If the first patient comes along: interesting. If somebody else comes along, you think something’s going on. If a third person comes along, it’s not a coincidence.” As more patients started to arrive, the A\u0026ampE department declared a major incident.A report published in January by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that the fire service deployed mobile gas detectors calibrated to locate carbon monoxide, oxygen, flammable gas and hydrogen sulphide – chemicals they might expect to encounter in the course of their more regular callouts. Only a very low reading was recorded for flammable gas and a single reading for ammonia at a level too low to be registered by humans. Furthermore, a police tactical adviser specialising in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats was called in to test the air, but again found nothing of concern. No samples were taken by any agency.As dusk fell, a queue had formed at the hospital, as patients were assessed by medics in fluorescent green hazmat suits and processed through a decontamination tent set up outside A\u0026ampE. At one point more than 80 people were queueing. Patients arrived throughout the night and into the next morning. On the advice of the National Poisons Information Service, 108 were showered, their clothes placed in a plastic bag, and issued with a hospital gown and slippers before proceeding to A\u0026ampE. Consultant Dr Zeki Atesli was on call that day. “The most common complaint was red eyes,” he says. “The poisons unit mentioned ammonia, but I didn’t smell any gas. We didn’t know what we were dealing with. One patient with acute exacerbation of asthma we took into resus as a precaution another gentleman in his 70s with a history of angina developed chest pain. One girl collapsed in my arms from the anxiety. But no one was pushing or screaming. English people are very nice. They stay in the queue.”“You could taste it,” Chadwick-Bell says. “It was an acidy-type taste.” Hearing that the cloud was moving west, she contacted Eastbourne’s sister hospital at St Leonards-on-Sea in Hastings, 14 miles along the coast, which was put on alert for a major incident. “They had their tent out and they were ready to go.” Although only a few patients turned up in Hastings, the cloud had spread far beyond Birling Gap. Just over half a mile inland, people drinking in the garden of the Tiger Inn in East Dean were advised by police to evacuate, while sore throats and stinging eyes were experienced at a beer festival in Litlington, three miles north-west of Birling Gap. Tony Fitch, who has been fishing in the area for 65 years, spent the day on the beach at Pevensey Bay, nine miles east. He remembers a mist and a sea breeze from the south-east, and while he noticed nothing amiss at the time, the next morning he had a sore throat and sore eyes, symptoms he says have lingered to this day.Eastbourne’s new town slogan, launched in the summer of 2016, caused a stir: “Breathe It In” is a brave choice for a town recently ranked as one of Britain’s worst for air quality. Dr Gary Fuller of King’s College London, an expert in air pollution, works with the Sussex Air Quality Partnership, an organisation promoting better air quality in the county. He explains that two fixed monitors registered unusually high spikes of ozone late in the afternoon on 27 August, at around the time of the haze. “The peaks were exceptional,” he says. “This wasn’t just something confined to the beach at Birling Gap it was covering a far wider area.” A monitor at Lullington Heath, five miles inland, and another in Eastbourne both recorded a rapid rise in the gas on the same afternoon. The abruptness of the peaks was unusual, however, and it’s possible the monitors were responding to another substance: chlorine, for instance, can affect ozone readings. “It didn’t behave as we would expect ozone to behave,” Fuller says.While no one appeared to have been made seriously ill, dozens of Stephen Lloyd’s constituents, who hours earlier had been sunbathing, found themselves standing naked in a decontamination shower. No one knows how many more experienced symptoms, but tens of thousands were advised to close their doors and windows and stay inside. Lloyd began pressing the agencies for information.“At the back of my mind I was thinking: suppose if someone had dropped dead. Surely someone’s going to tell me what it is. Where the hell did it come from? Everyone’s telling me it’s probably a boat cleaning its tanks. But not to worry, they said, the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency are checking it out.”According to a freedom of information request, Public Health England’s working hypothesis, revealed in an email sent to the Cabinet Office at 1am that night, was that “a tanker in the English Channel suffered a leakage of ammonia”, even though only small amounts had been detected at Birling Gap. As well as monitoring fuel emissions, the International Maritime Organization regulates the discharge of effluent and bilge water, chemical-cargo vapours, tank-cleaning chemicals and ballast-water disinfectants. Any of these, released deliberately or by accident, may have been to blame. Sawyer found two reports of a chemical tanker washing out its tanks on the edge of the fishing lanes that day, but the vessel was not identified. The coastguard received a report of a vessel discharging “odd-coloured exhaust” but it, too, has been ruled out as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.At the Sovereign Harbour lifeboat station, a live GPS screen shows all the vessels in the Channel. Looking out through the window, I can make out only two or three hazy ghosts of ships on the horizon, but the screen shows dozens – private yachts, trawlers, 30,000-tonne tankers, 150,000-tonne container ships – with their rate of knots and direction, and ports of origin and destination. Little can pass through the Channel unmonitored.Using techniques developed in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986, the Met Office was able to trace the course of the plume in the hours before it reached Birling Gap. According to Defra, “The surface air had come over the sea from an easterly direction for the previous nine hours but before that the wind had been… from the west. This strongly suggests an offshore source in the northern part of the English Channel, and effectively rules out France or onshore sources in southern England.” But the timescale, the size of the area from which the substance could have come and the fact that it hadn’t been identified meant the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency was unable to narrow down the number of suspect vessels to fewer than 180, many of which were hundreds of miles away by the time the analysis was done.In Fuller’s experience, the event is unprecedented in Britain. The only incident that comes close occurred in 1997, when a tanker collision off Ostend, Belgium, sent a cloud of petrol vapour across central England, causing irritation to skin and eyes. But both the substance and its source were quickly identified. “We tend to focus on air pollution in towns,” he adds. “We forget there are big sources out there, just a few miles off the coast.”Professor John Sodeau, an expert in air pollution and atmospheric chemistry at University College Cork, believes the weather conditions on the day are crucial to understanding what happened. He suggests that sulphurous emissions from ships’ engines reacted with chlorine-containing substances used in the cleaning of ballast or cargo tanks, and the resulting gases and vapours accumulated in the sunny, windless conditions. As he puts it, “Throw the ingredients into a saucepan, bring to the boil, put on a lid and leave to simmer.” Such a “soup” could not only cause symptoms of the kind reported when blown ashore, but could result in the creation of compounds that might smell like burning plastic or chlorine, as well as raising ozone levels.But shipping waste was not the only theory. Two days after the event, the Twitter account of the NERC Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (Neodaas) posted an image recorded by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite at 10.56 on the morning of the cloud. It shows Birling Gap on the coast, and on the water, about five miles to the south-west, a slender plume of what looks like smoke. It is about two miles long and extends in a roughly easterly direction. No ship is visible. The following day, another Twitter user replied: “That is the position of the wreck of ww1 tanker Mira.”The SS Mira, a merchant oil tanker sunk by a mine in October 1917, lies 20 metres underwater at almost precisely the point from which the plume appears to originate. Could this have been the source? Ben Taylor of Neodaas, who posted the images, says the plume is not visible in satellite passes from the previous month, and first appears seven hours before people began to experience symptoms at Birling Gap. It was soon observed that the plume was heading in the wrong direction to have hit Birling Gap – east, rather than west with the wind. Taylor now believes it was not gas or vapour but underwater silt, disturbed by the shifting of the 100-year-old wreck and carried on currents. But as he says, “The timing is certainly strange.”For his part, Tony Fitch, who was fishing at Pevensey Bay that day, is convinced the cloud came from a French nuclear power station, more than 60 miles across the Channel. He has asked his GP to test him for the effects of radiation. It would not be the first time a substance carried on the air from France affected the region: people in Eastbourne and across southern England remember “Le Pong” of 2013, when an escape of methanethiol, a chemical used to add a warning odour to domestic gas, floated over from a chemical works in Rouen, 100 miles away.The ersity of public theories about the origin of the substance – chlorine gas leaking from a first world war wreck an accident at an incinerator some creation of a nearby offshore windfarm a top-secret military psyop – is inevitable, given that the substance remains officially unidentified eight months later. It was for this reason, too, that the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency aborted its investigation in late September.“They told me all the way through,” says Stephen Lloyd MP, “‘Don’t worry, we’ve identified the ships that were in the area, but we have to wait till they port before we check it out.’ But then six weeks later I hear: ‘No, we’re not doing it, there’s no point, because we don’t know what it is.’ It is criminally wrong that this country and our emergency services don’t have the kit that can store, assess and measure what the hell this was.”Lloyd is not alone in pressing for more information. Green party MEP Keith Taylor has asked Defra whether the incident was reported to the European Commission. The Seveso directive states a report must be made by an EU member country if more than 500 people are “evacuated or confined” for over two hours as a result of an accident involving a dangerous substance. He believes the event meets these criteria, but the commission can find no record of such a report being made, and Defra has not responded to requests for clarification. “It is hard to escape the feeling that the government has consistently shrugged its shoulders in response to this incident,” Taylor says.He also highlights a second incident, four miles along the coast exactly two months later. On the night of 27 October, a stench of burning plastic was reported by residents of Seaford, along with burning eyes and nausea. Although the council attributed the odour to nearby agricultural activity, residents wondered if there was a connection to the more serious event that summer.Defra’s scientific report into the incident, released in January, concludes that, while a ship remains the most likely culprit, “unless further information is obtained, it may never be possible to identify the precise source of the release”.“If one old person or one baby had died because of this gas,” Lloyd says, “and no one knew what it was, my God, there would have been resignations of chief executives and secretaries of state.”In December, Defra announced a review of the emergency response which, among other issues, will investigate “the practicalities of taking, storing and analysing gas samples in future events of this kind”. But the experts have their doubts. “You do not just collect the air in a bell jar and take it home for later analysis,” says air pollution specialist John Sodeau. “Samples have to be collected on site and analysed in real time. The levels may be parts per trillion or billion and the chemical radicals involved may last for only seconds.”Defra’s review is ongoing. It has no plans to make its findings public. For Eastbourne district general hospital, the event was a valuable learning exercise. Dr Atesli has been asked to speak about it at medical conferences. “You don’t expect something like this in Eastbourne,” he says. “But it can happen.”Laura Knight, whose cough lasted for two weeks, still hopes for answers. “It’s really concerning,” she says. “I don’t know if there’s something in my body, and nobody else knows either.”On my last visit, Birling Gap was busy with visitors enjoying the midwinter sun. The only haze was from the waves crashing on the chalk foreshore, the only masks worn by a few Japanese tourists making their way across the car park. On the horizon, the world’s ships plied back and forth.• William Atkins’ The Immeasurable World: Journeys In Desert Places will be published in June.Commenting on this piece?

Marcus Rashford makes the six-man shortlist, while the Fulham teenager Ryan Sessegnon completes the names.De Bruyne has been outstanding in City’s march towards the Premier League title. His technical quality has been a key component in the slick football played by Pep Guardiola’s side, and heading into the weekend the Belgian led the top flight for assists with 15. He has also weighed in with seven goals.The lightning-quick Germany winger Sané is second in the assists table behind De Bruyne with 12 and has also scored nine times in the Premier League. Silva is the only one of the three to taste Premier League glory with City in the past, having been part of the squad which lifted the trophy in 2012 and 2014. The Spain playmaker has eight goals and 11 assists to his name in a City team which has dominated the competition this year.Kane and Salah had a phenomenal 54 Premier League goals between them heading into the weekend. England striker Kane reached 100 career Premier League goals in February while Salah has enjoyed a stellar debut season at Anfield and went into the weekend’s action needing just one more goal to reach 40 in all competitions for the Reds. The Egypt star scored in both legs as Liverpool knocked out City to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League earlier this week.De Gea has enjoyed another excellent campaign for United, and will be hoping to become the first goalkeeper to win the award since Peter Shilton in 1978. His City counterpart Ederson has proved to be an excellent addition for his club after goalkeeper proved a problem position for Guardiola last season. His reward is a place on the Young Player of the Year shortlist.City team-mate Sterling has been impressive in front of goal this term, and his 16 league strikes place him joint fourth in the competition. Sessegnon is the youngest player on the list at 17. He has been instrumental in Fulham’s push to reach the Premier League, scoring 14 times in the Sky Bet Championship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ea2c8a508d2be4fb2bce3f9d9a76dce091c573/182_0_5263_3158/master/5263.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ae5f1668b7b5d85113b1f3e766741257 1240w","title":"rome derby roma lazio champions league place","story":"Lazio are in pieces after a shattering Europa League exit a day after Roma’s miracle comeback against Barcelona but a Champions League spot is at stake on SundayThe biggest Rome derby in at least half a decade has been overshadowed by events preceding it. On Tuesday, Roma pulled off one of the great European comebacks: recovering from three goals down to eliminate Barcelona from the Champions League and reach the semi-finals. The shoe was on the other foot for Lazio two days later, as their 4-2 lead from the first leg became a 6-5 defeat to RB Salzburg in the Europa League.Such results define entire seasons. Even if Roma lose to their semi-final opponents Liverpool, this would still be the furthest they have gone in a European Cup since the Reds beat them in the 1984 final. The almost 60,000 fans who attended on Tuesday will never forget watching their team reduce Lionel Messi to a helpless bystander.Lazio’s supporters, conversely, saw the dream of only a second European trophy slip away. Perhaps that will bring Sunday’s game into even sharper focus. In another season, this might have been the most important fixture by far.Roma and Lazio start this weekend joint-third in Serie A, level on 60 points with seven games remaining. Internazionale, who are at Atalanta on Saturday night, kick off one point behind them in fifth. With Juventus and Napoli in effect locked into the top spots, it is a case of three into two for a place in next season’s Champions League.The financial implications are obvious. Roma have already earned upwards of €70m from this European run, a hugely significant sum for a club that posted losses of more than €40m after missing out last season. For Lazio, whose operating revenue is far smaller than that of their rivals, the impact would be even greater.Sunday’s game, though, is about far more than bank balances. This has been a year of footballing revival in Italy’s capital, those European runs breeding fresh enthusiasm in the stands. Full houses such as the one that greeted Barcelona are still an uncommon sight at the Stadio Olimpico but average attendances at both Rome clubs’ games have risen by more than 4,000 from last year.Such energy stems in part from the presence of two young and ambitious managers, each with a clear and contrasting vision of how the game should be played.Roma’s Eusebio Di Francesco is a Zdenek Zeman disciple who views rigour as the key to victory, drilling the same movements over and over. At their best, his teams are compact, opportunistic and aggressive.Simone Inzaghi is more of a pragmatist. At Lazio, he has identified inidual players’ strengths and designed his team to exploit them. In Ciro Immobile he found a striker whose game was lacking in certain areas but who could time a run as well as anyone. So Inzaghi set the Biancocelesti up to sit deep and play on the counter, waiting for opponents to overcommit and leave space in behind.The results have been wildly entertaining. Lazio are Serie A’s top scorers, with 75 goals in 31 games. Immobile leads the league with 27, but Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Luis Alberto each have nine. Inzaghi’s team have, however, also conceded 40 times in the league, more than Juventus and Napoli combined.Di Francesco could never abide such sloppiness. Roma are more reliable and yet perhaps more predictable for it. Edin Dzeko destroyed Barcelona with his direct and powerful runs but when opponents do find a way to neutralise him, the Giallorossi sometimes struggle. The craft and unpredictability of Cengiz Under has been a boon, but he is only just back from a hamstring injury.This will be the Turkish forward’s first game against Lazio, if he plays. Will he feel the occasion as keenly as his manager once did? Di Francesco, who spent four seasons at Roma as a player, recalls walking out beneath his team’s supporters in the Curva Sud before his first derby, and feeling his legs start to shake uncontrollably for the one and only time in his career.There have been more weighty editions than this one, but not many. Most obvious is the 2013 Coppa Italia final, the only time Rome’s two leading clubs have met with a piece of major silverware on the line. Lazio won 1-0, with a goal from Senad Lulic. The fallout continued for months, with Lazio supporters holding a mock funeral procession for Roma through the city and flying planes trailing reminders of their triumph during the summer that followed.Sunday’s game cannot deliver such a permanent verdict. It is conceivable that either team could lose and yet still pip the other to a top-four spot. But after a week of such contrasting highs and lows, it is a game that offers tantalising opportunities for glory or redemption. “Right now we are in pieces,” said Inzaghi in the wake of Thursday’s collapse. “But on Sunday we have another big chance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f89ccd4c843626574756ac0c88a83ea591d0390b/0_95_2577_1546/master/2577.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5e78b4c485ab64362865d26e1581d62a 1240w","title":"southampton v chelsea premier league live","story":"47 min “Sir,” says Geoff James. “Those are formidable mental gymnastics to conclude that (i) Alonso was “clumsy” and (ii) Dean didn’t see it.”Thanks very much.46 min Southampton begin the second half.

Not for the first time this season, he looks like he thinks the world is against him.32 min “What’s your opinion of Mark Hughes as a manager?” says Shaun Wilkinson. “I feel that, although at times he has done himself no favours in PR terms, his record is really not that bad it seems some self-consciously modern football observers are always so desperate to show their contempt for ‘proper football men’, and because Hughes comes into that category for them, they try to make him out to be a hapless chancer who keeps getting jobs because he is one of the aforementioned PFMs. His record doesn’t really deserve that for me. What do you think?”Yes, I agree. I think his best years were early in his career, with Wales and that excellent Blackburn side, but he did a decent job at Stoke as well. The Man City job must haunt him, especially that weird run of draws in the winter of 2009. If he could have held onto that job until the start of the following season, his career might be very different.29 min Willian’s inswinging corner from the left almost sneaks straight into the net! The backpedalling McCarthy just managed to flap it away at the last minute.27 min A lofted ball to the far post is headed back across goal by Zappacosta, who seemed to foul Bertrand in the process, and headed wide by the stretching Morata. There would have been ructions had that gone in because Mike Dean didn’t give a foul.26 min What an opportunity this is for Southampton. Chelsea are full of class but they are not exactly oozing professional pride. If Southampton win today, they have every chance of staying up.25 min Long’s dangerous inswinging cross from the left just evades the stretching Cedric. Southampton have been superb since the goal.23 min “Dear Tracksuit Dave,” says Mac Millings. “Despite giving it my best effort, I haven’t felt as much emotion in 46 years of life as Antonio Conte shows in 90 minutes. How somene would be able to summon the energy to fake that is quite beyond me. Maybe it’s his constant delight at keeping John Terry out of a job.” Southampton take the lead! Dusan Tadic is the scorer but it was made by a storming run from Ryan Bertrand. He covered half the length of the pitch before swerving around Azpilicueta and into the area. From there he was aware enough to cut the ball back perfectly for Tadic, who sidefooted past Courtois from eight yards.18 min Alonso strolls forward and is fouled by Romeu 30 yards from goal. It’s far to the left for a shot, so Willian clips it into the area. It just evades the stretching Morata and bounces into the loving embrace of McCarthy.16 min “Bobbo,” says Mac Millings. “I’m old now, and life is too short to go looking for conflict, so I haven’t been willing to muster up enough bile to hate anyone in football for a long time - but if John Terry became Chelsea manager, I think I might be prepared to make an exception.”Can’t you just let bigots be bigots? Bygones, I meant bygones.15 min Morata runs the ball out of play. Corner to Chelsea. Thankfully for the referee Mike Dean, nothing comes of it.14 min This is all a bit cautious from Southampton. They are up against a decent team, of course, but I expected a bit more oomph. Maybe their plan is to stay in the game for an hour and win it with their attacking substitutes.12 min The PFA shortlists are in, and Emerson Palmieri has just missed out.10 min Chelsea continue to dominate possession, with Southampton playing on the break. The pace of play from both sides has been a bit slow.8 min Big news from Kirkwall, where Orkney are 2-0 up after five minutes. They’re going to be champions!7 min “You are a funny guy,” says Tracksuit Dave. “Now we will have 90 mins of him jumping up and down in his technical are to make out that he cares. But again you in the media aren´t allowed to question the authenticity of Conte´s touchline pain are you?”Lighten up Dave, it’s the weekend. This whole idea of the media having a party line is, in my experience, hardly ever true. I’m sure there’s some unconscious groupthink but it’s rarely a deliberate policy. Also, Conte won you the league last season!6 min A couple of good crosses, first from Bertrand and then Tadic, flash across the area. Southampton only had Long in the box, which might be a problem with this formation.5 min Chelsea have had a lot of early possession but all in front of Southampton.4 min “That “madman” line has reminded me of my favourite Ferguson quote,” says Mac Millings. “’In the evening I have one of those rewarding and satisfying obligations: helping to judge a painting competition for primary school children, organised by the Rainbow Trust in aid of St. Francis Hospice...It’s amazing how brilliant the kids are when they are encouraged to express themselves...I’m loaded with flu but I was never going to miss this engagement.’ I’ve often wondered how many of those vulnerable children survived Typhoid Fergie’s visit.”Ah man, I miss Fergie. I’m re-reading Daniel Taylor’s brilliant This Is The One at the moment, and some of the Fergie passages read like Irvine Welsh. Imagine having that bloke on your side. You’d think you could climb Everest in your slippers. I used to think he was the greatest football manager of all time I’m now almost certain he’s the greatest living human.3 min A quiet start, nothing to report.2 min “As I don’t care a bit about the match at hand, the business about the FA Cup does interest me,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “I do wish UEFA would butt out and leave each nation to its own way of sorting out its Champions League entries. Of course England would allot at least the top 2 of its 4 entries to the 1st and 2nd place finishers. But beyond that? Who’s to say? Why not a playoff between the FA Cup and League Cup winners? Or a plaoff amongst finishers 3-6? Or (and this one I really like) let the fans choose any team outside of the top 3? Let’s have some fun for a change!”This is not “fun”, Hubert. This is football. 1 min Peep peep! Chelsea kick off on a bright, sunny afternoon.The players are in the tunnel. If nothing else, Southampton deserve to stay up because of their kit, a snazzy tribute o the Ranx Xerox classic of the early 1980s.The really big game this lunchtime is at Kirkwall Grammar School, where Orkney FC are aiming to win the North Caledonian League for the first time in their history. They just have to win their last game at home to Bunillidh Thistle ’Mon the Reds!“Funny how Antonio only starts playing Willian and Hazard when it´s obvious his sabotage has gone too far,” says Tracksuit Dave. “Maybe Roman has told him he will have to sue for his payoff? We want JT but no-one will come out in the media and say it.”I can’t speak for other companies, but at the Guardian we get daily email reminders not to say it. A bit of the old pre-match reading“You mentioned the FA Cup,” says Ian Copestake, “and it reminded me that I had forgotten the poor thing was still going on.”Technically it’s been dead since the early 2000s. But they keep wheeling it out, like Jimmy White’s brother.“Drinkwater not even on the bench today?” says Chris. “He’s rightfully expressed his concern about lack of playing time but I can’t see why he’s been banished like this. He’s still a CFC player and this smacks of silly beggars by Conte.” Sir Alex Ferguson used to say, re: his team selection, that you should never try to read the mind of a madman. With Chelsea, that applies to the whole club.Morning. Southampton are not too good to go down – but they bloody well should be! It makes precisely no sense that a team with so many accomplished footballers, who have finished between sixth and eighth for the last four seasons, should be scrambling desperately to avoid relegation. They have won only one of their last 19 league games, and that was against West Brom, so it doesn’t really count. What does count is their display at the Emirates last weekend. Southampton’s fine performance in the 3-2 defeat at Arsenal might be a turning point, especially if they can back it up with another good performance - and ideally a result - against Chelsea today. It’s their first home match for six weeks, and a chance to change theChelsea have been in similarly abysmal form in 2018, with 12 points from 11 games. They can’t finish higher than their current fifth place, and their league campaign has drifted into a nihilistic nothingness. The two teams meet again in the FA Cup semi-finals next weekend. That’s the game that really matters to Chelsea. Southampton would happily sacrifice it for a win today.Kick off is at 12.30pm.

A coffee with a piece of fruit: apple, orange, banana … And maybe a couple of biscuits. It is depends on what I’m racing as the following day – if it’s lightweight, then I have to eat less. It’s all about weight management it plays on your mind all the time. If you wake up five to six pounds heavier, you know that somewhere down the line you’re just going to have to lose it again, so even if you try eating a bit more normally while you’re on holiday, you tend to get back on to your working diet very quickly.Usually at about 11am – you don’t want to eat a full meal between rides, so it’s tiny: two to four chicken nuggets or a chicken wrap. I imagine my stomach is fairly small, but you do settle into it. We’re so active there’s no sitting around. We get 10 days off in August, but apart from that, we’re racing all year round, always on the clock.I still live with my mum, and she looks after me very well. I love pasta – carbonara especially – but I avoid eating too many carbs. So it’s usually chicken – stews, grilled, wrapped in bacon – or steak, rare. With two to three veg – spinach, carrot. My mum’s very trad, and I’m not very fussy.Lots of sweets. I use up a lot of energy, so I often need an energy boost. I love Haribo Tangfastics, but I’ll have anything really. I have a really sweet tooth. And the odd packet of crisps – beef Hula Hoops or purple Monster Munch. I spend a lot of my day in the car – about 60,000 miles a year – so going to the garage is a bit of a nightmare. I could buy everything. Once every two to three days, I’ll have a can of Coke, but most of the time it’s a builder’s tea with a good few sugars, with maybe a biscuit if there are any. And Robinson’s squash – apple and blackcurrant – with fizzy water. I make it quite strong, with an inch of cordial per glass."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e9c4299ebe7a156beb1bc20d8d3a551bdda5c72/1421_375_3157_3156/master/3157.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=208cfbb114acf7a1afb78e8a84f4e448 1240w","title":"meera sodha recipe vegan chocolate date coffee cake","story":"A cake deep in colour and flavour – and ideal for any time of the dayThe joy of cake-baking is that it is simultaneously selfish and generous. Selfish in that a cake can be finely tuned to your exact preferences to create your perfect flavour, texture and appearance and generous in that, by their very nature, all cakes are best when shared (unless your name is Bruce Bogtrotter). Today’s recipe happens to be my perfect slice. It’s packed full of my favourite sweet ingredients: dates, dark chocolate, coffee and cardamom, built on a base of bananas for density, and topped with ganache and flowers just for fun.Pour the ganache over the cake while it’s on a wire rack for a clean look or, for a more natural style, put it on a plate and let the ganache run down the sides. Or skip the ganache entirely, and turn this into more of a morning or afternoon cake.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Grease an 20cm springform cake tin with rapeseed oil, then line the base with baking paper.In a small bowl, soak the flax seeds in three tablespoons of water. Put the coffee in a jug, cover with 220ml just-boiled water, mix, strain (you should get about 200ml coffee) and stir in two tablespoons of sugar.Put the dates in a saucepan, cover with 250ml just-boiled water, then cook on medium heat, stirring often, until the water is absorbed and the dates disintegrate into a paste – eight to 10 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the bicarb (it will fizz). Add the bananas to the date mix, then stir in the flax seeds, oil, 50g sugar and 100ml coffee. Break one chocolate bar into pea-sized pieces and stir in.In a large bowl, whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, cocoa powder and ground cardamom, then fold in the date mixture. Tip into the cake tin and level out the top with the back of a spoon. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 150C300Fgas 2 and cook for 50 minutes more, until a skewer comes out clean, then leave to cool before turning out on to a rack or plate.For the ganache, break the second chocolate bar into pea-sized pieces and put in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (take care the base doesn’t come into contact with the hot water) and stir until melted and glossy. Whisk in the remaining 100ml coffee, then pour over the cake.

I used to stand at the front and sing requests. They’d shout out, “Sing us Puppet On A String, love”. I would sing the hit parade while sand would slowly seep out of my knicker leg from the sandpit in the nursery.Which living person do you most admire, and why?My parents. They have been the best example of a loving and respectful marriage over 60 years.What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?Overestimating how much I can pack into a day.

Leeds is next in line, with Ofo placing 1,000 bikes in the city next month, Mobike is expanding around Manchester, while in London more and more boroughs are greeting the arrival of the yellow and red cycles.The concept is simple: you need a smartphone and a credit card. Download the app, load your credit card details, hire a bike for a low fee (usually 50p, but more of that later), then locate it on a map on your phone. Once at the bike, scan the QR code to unlock it and you’re off. At your destination find somewhere sensible to leave it, then lock it – that’s it.The reality, of course, is a little different – damaged and stolen cycles have littered canals, bins and back gardens, with residents complaining about clogged pathways and commuters angry about pile-ups at stations.The firms insist that after early setbacks, behaviour is improving and fewer bikes are being lost to vandalism. However, Mobike said last week that it is raising its fee from 50p to 69p for half an hour to encourage people to “treat the bikes respectfully” and park them better.So are they a cheap and cheerful alternative to cars, buses and taxis? Or an uncomfortable ride? We tested three services and found that Ofo easily beat Mobike for usability, while Santander Cycles is the only option, for now, for riders 1.83m (6ft) or above in height.Cost: 69p for every 30 minutes, 50p in London. Initial £1 deposit. Longer-term passes: £9.90 a month, £24.90 for 90 days, or £89.90 for a year.Ride: I’m 1.83m tall. The saddle, raised to its maximum, was still so low the bicycle was unrideable. There are no gears, so going uphill is heavy work. It felt unwieldy despite its modern design, with enclosed disc brakes and airless tyres. I asked some shorter colleagues to do a test ride Miles Brignall and Lisa O’Carroll found the seating position acceptable, but both declared the bikes too heavy.Sign-up: I downloaded the app over Google Play, with the contract and card details kept with Beijing Mobike Technology Co Ltd. The app required location access, which I agreed to, and offered a yesno for access to photos, media and to “make and manage phone calls”. I said “no” to these and the app still worked. It pre-selected a £9.90 monthly pass, but I was able to select the 50p-a-journey option instead. It was better than Ofo in warnings to leave the bike in a suitable place.Bike locating: Lots of available cycles immediately populated my phone screen, but the Guardian is in King’s Cross so that’s understandable. Unfortunately, it sent me to the wrong side of the canal for my first bike hire.Score: 510. Must do better. Its PRs are keen to point out that Mobike 3.0 is launching, with higher saddles for the European market. Once in place I’d consider using it, but until then it’s pointless for me.Cost: 50p for every 30 minutes, capped at £5 a day. No deposit. No passes either, but these are likely to be launched soon.Ride: Far better than Mobike. The saddle height was a little higher although still too low for me. It is more of a traditional-style bike, with three gears, so riding uphill is better. It felt lighter than the Mobike and although the bright yellow is ugly, it’s undoubtedly more visible to car drivers. Brignall and O’Carroll also found the ride lighter and easier.Sign-up: Again, I downloaded the app via Google Play – the contract is with Yellow Bike (Beijing) Data Services Co Ltd. It required access to contacts, location, photos and media, with no optout – you had to accept all these for the app to download. It has a simpler sign-up process, but less information than Mobike about pricing and scoring, where you are penalised if you leave the bike in a wrong geolocation, such as Camden – right next to Islington – which is yet to give Ofo permission for its bikes.Bike locating: Again, there are lots close to me although maybe a tad fewer than Mobike. I found the closest one easily.Score: 710. It needs to improve the frame and saddle height to make it acceptable to European customers. The PRs are keen to point out that they have begun replacing early models with ones that have a seating position that’s around 10cm higher. I tried one and they are much better, but will still be a challenge for anyone much taller than me.Cost: We tested Santander Cycles in London – rates in other cities vary. There is a £2 access fee for 24 hours, so long as no single journey exceeds 30 minutes. An annual unlimited-use pass is £90.Ride: Heavy but manageable. Saddles can be adjusted to suit nearly all heights. The cycles have three gears and the lights are better than Mobike and Ofo. The big design flaw is the front basket, which is little more than a bungee-style cord – a pain when you have some shopping. Mobike’s and Ofo’s are both simpler.Sign-up: You don’t need a smartphone or an app as you can sign up at the docking station with a debit or credit card. The on-screen process takes a few minutes to give a printout of a code that releases the bike. Annual-pass holders are sent a release key, which is quicker.Bike locating: A big drawback is that you must find a docking station (although Santander’s app can help) and hope bikes will be available. At your destination, it’s fingers crossed again that a dock will be free. Transport for London tries to redistribute bikes\u0026nbsparound the system, but not always successfully.Score: 810. These are good cycles and far more are available if you are just using them in central London, especially with a key-pass. But outside the city centre (north of King’s Cross or south of OvalKennington) there are almost no docking stations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcd7cdfb621f55f4451fd226d7644695b6b1ec86/437_65_2571_1543/master/2571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c075a4dce855c330008daaf03c5fc575 1240w","title":"gigs cost live music","story":"I’ve been obsessed with music since the age of 14.

It usually costs me about £500 a month, including travel.I’m a big fan of singer-songwriters, and old-school indie bands. My favourite artists are Morrissey, Adam Ant and Robert Forster, former member of the Go-Betweens. I’ve seen Forster 50 times in the last 30 years. He once did three UK gigs on consecutive nights in Glasgow, Manchester and London. I went to all three.I will also spend up to £20 on merchandise at each gig. But often I’ve already got all the stuff they’re selling – I spend £80 to £100 on CDs, books, DVDs and vinyl each month. It varies, depending on what has been released and whether I can resist the temptation.I don’t just listen to music – I play it, too. I own 25 guitars but they weren’t very expensive. The most I’ve ever spent on a guitar is £500.I don’t buy MP3s or subscribe to Spotify and I’ll always pay £1 extra for a ticket to be posted. I like owning a product.

They are for my kids.Songs come to life when you hear them performed live. There are subtle differences, you can hear the artist at work. I also love discovering the support acts. I once saw The Killers supporting British Sea Power at Colchester Arts Centre.Each music venue affects the character of the gig in different ways and changes how I experience the music. Life is about experiences, after all. You can’t take your money with you. All you have on your deathbed is what you’ve done with your life and the places you’ve been.I recently bought a folding bike for £100 so I could explore all the music venues in the cities I visit for gigs. I’m curious about venues whose names I know well from tour itineraries, and towns I wouldn’t normally go to. I find I often have great conversations with like-minded people I don’t know in the crowd. I’ve written a book, London Gig Venues, which covers 600 music venues in the city.Quite often, I’ll work out a route round the UK that enables me to combine our family holidays with a gig I want to go to.My very understanding wife will stay in, looking after our three children. We used to go together, before babysitters. Her favourite band is the Pet Shop Boys. Once we got tickets to see them, but my wife went into labour late. A day or two after the child was born, I went off with her sister to the gig. It’s unfortunate they were her favourite band but it didn’t make sense to waste the tickets.My daughter Ciara, who is 11, has been to about 20 gigs with me over the past two years. Often, when the band sees a little girl in the audience, they point her out. So she thinks every gig you go to, the artist makes a reference to it or you get to meet him or her afterwards.My wife has her own lifestyle PR agency and I work for her. We split the household bills. I pay £200 for council tax, £230 for gas and electricity, and £400 on food each month. My wife pays the mortgage and the broadband and mobile phone bills. She knew I was obsessed with music when we married but I have promised her I’ll cut down on gigs this year.Sometimes the children roll their eyes and say: “Daddy’s off to a gig again.” But I’m not someone who goes off to the pub or watches football. Music is my passion.As told to Donna Ferguson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d271d4782e7faeac50515891b6d395b3f60585f/0_0_5448_3268/master/5448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1775626f507611f797cd9153fada7711 1240w","title":"wonga mark 2 new breed of payday lenders oakam","story":" The worst of the payday lenders, famed for offering short-term loans at sky-high interest rates, may have faded away, but vulnerable consumers are still being targeted with offers of loans with four-figure APRs.Debt charity StepChange says 1.4m lower-income households resorted to high-cost credit to meet living costs last year – up from 1.1m in 2016.It found those using such credit tend to be on low incomes and often in insecure jobs with irregular work patterns.

With her new album Joyride, has her moment finally arrived?Halfway through school at California’s Crescenta Valley High, budding actor Tinashe Jorgensen Kachingwe made a new best friend. She was delighted to have found this new acquaintance, and sad when she had to leave school for two months to shoot a TV movie, Cora Unashamed. On her return to Crescenta, she discovered her BFF didn’t like her any more. No one did. Her friend turned into a bully and created a We Hate Tinashe group of which she was leader. She would ring Kachingwe at home to describe exactly how she was going to “fuck her up” at school the next day. She, like everyone else, didn’t like the fact Kachingwe was on TV. “There were groups of girls who would throw food at me in the hallways,” she remembers. “Like, cereal. And milk. Gross stuff like that. People were pretty mean.” Despite such torrential tormenting, the 25-year-old – now the singer who goes simply by Tinashe – is remarkably sanguine about these experiences. “It led me to be hyper-focused on what I wanted from life and that was how I was able to stay happy and not get depressive as a kid,” she says in the cafe of New York’s New Museum, where we meet to discuss her long-overdue second album proper, Joyride. “It’s easy to feel like the whole world is against you as a kid, but the world is bigger than school.” It’s a lesson Tinashe has retained, applying the same sage standards to “what people are saying online” about her life and music. “Everything will get better. You just have to keep focusing on what makes you happy and what fulfils you. For me that’s making music and performing.” Does she still see those girls? “Fuckin’ bitches,” she grins. “Where are they now?”Although people no longer chuck food at Tinashe’s head, they do throw a lot of shade her way. They question why her records don’t sell. With her catalogue a combination of subtle, silky trap and rap-infused tracks and glossy hits (Player the DJ Mustard co-produced 2 On her collaboration with Snakehips on All My Friends) critics say she’s either too pop or too R\u0026ampB – or not enough of either. “I think genres should just die,” she says. “As a human being, you don’t limit yourself to being one thing or other I don’t think people think of themselves in that way. It’s the same for how I present my music, how I listen to music, how I dress, how I live my life. It’s not black and white. Who you are is actually much more complex.”The last time she spoke to the Guardian the internet disseminated Tinashe’s thoughts on colourism and sexism (“Sometimes I feel like I don’t fully fit into the black community they don’t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman,” being one quote). Television host Wendy Williams delivered a snippy three-minute bit about the interview. “She’s blaming Rihanna and Beyoncé for her lack of success?” Williams asked. “You have no one to blame but yourself, Tinashe. You gotta make your own path. Mariah, Drake and Alicia Keys are all biracial, so what’s your next excuse?”Meanwhile, fans and trolls lined up to wonder where the album was and whether it might sell more than her “critically acclaimed” (translation: didn’t sell well) debut, 2014’s Aquarius. This is another aspect of “the business” that Tinashe has little time for. “You’re either at this super-high level of fame and dominating the whole world or you’re a failure, which is just not accurate,” she insists. “My definition of success has changed over the course of this album. I’ve learned that making the music and art and videos I want to make, that’s enough for me. I don’t feel like I need all the accolades.”It has taken Tinashe time to reach such a place of self-satisfaction, however. With more than 200 tracks recorded and “numerous” iterations of Joyride in the vault, the album seemed destined never to see the light of day. Finally, last summer, Tinashe let go a little. She moved into a new home in the Hollywood Hills with sweeping views of LA and turned the guesthouse into a studio. She invited friends, producers, writers, graphic designers and artists over and together they zeroed in on the music, artwork and videos.“It was a really big turning point for me because I was able to focus creatively and get all my thoughts in one place. It really gave me perspective on what I’d already created and what I still needed to work on. It was more focused, more purposeful.”Joyride is a delightfully sleazy bop, full of red-light R\u0026ampB, woozy hip-hop and lyrics that linger on hook-ups and getting high. “It’s a snapshot of when I wasn’t in a relationship and I was trying to find myself,” she says. “That sense of confidence and almost braggadociousness was something that I wanted to express on the album – ‘I don’t need anybody, I’m good.’” She is now in a relationship with the basketball player Ben Simmons, another reason she’s living life a little lighter. “Ben has been an important part of being able to let go of the album creatively. Because you can get crazy,” she says.Funnily enough, it looks as if Joyride could just be a hit the Offset-featuring single No Drama clocked up a million views in one day, while the delightfully tactile Me So Bad and title track Joyride are streaming at rapid rates. The album is self-assured, a bit frivolous but occasionally weighty – such as on Easy on Me, which voices her frustrations with politics in the United States. The track, an interlude, is one of two Tinashe has produced on Joyride, having taught herself Pro Tools when she was 17. “When I first got on the scene I was honestly shocked that I could work for a whole year with hundreds of engineers and producers and not one would be another woman. We need to see more representation.”Having been in the entertainment industry for so much of her life – as both an actor (including her role as Celeste Burnett on Charlie Sheen’s Two and a Half Men) and a singer (who could forget her stint in the Stunners, a shortlived girlband signed to Columbia in 2007) – Tinashe has a deep understanding of the seismic shifts occurring at the moment. She believes, however, that the music business has a long way to go in order to catch up with the rest of the entertainment industry when it comes to the #MeToo movement.“Mostly it’s people’s perceptions of what it means to be a female artist and how you deal with your sexuality and people respecting your creative opinion. I haven’t had any straight-up, very outwardly sexist experiences in the music industry I’ve been very lucky. Maybe one session where I had to walk out where I was uncomfortable. But for the most part I’ve worked with really great people. The issue is really a systemic, cultural one that impacts across the board.”It’s time to leave the New Museum – Tinashe has a stack of CDs to sign before getting up at 4am to do Good Morning America. Before she goes, however, I wonder if she is really as happy, as calm, as sorted as she appears?“Honestly, yes. I think people respect me as an artist now. I’ve been making art for a good number of years. People have got past the point where they think I’m just a cute girl or a mindless puppet of a record label.” She may not yet be a superstar, but actually Tinashe is really very successful. And that’s more than enough. “However this album does, I’ve come to realise that I’m not going to stop making music if it isn’t a hit. I can say the same for the next album and the next album. So be it. I’m going to continue to make art and everything’s gonna be OK. I’m happy and confident and excited and proud of what I’ve done. Life is all right!”You believe her, you really do.Joyride is out now on RCA Records"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd46d18282e53e786314bf62f159e644e1204ee/0_167_2439_1463/master/2439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82cac3cca467042bde4ed1cc74637e93 1240w","title":"pm among cabinet members earning money as a landlord","story":"Exclusive: senior politicians such as Theresa May and Boris Johnson make thousands of pounds a year renting propertyNine cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, are making more than £10,000 a year by acting as landlords, a Guardian analysis has found.Following Jeremy Hunt’s failure to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he subsequently rented out, an analysis of the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests shows eight other members of the cabinet own property that is rented out for a five-figure annual sum.The health secretary was forced to make an embarrassing apology on Friday after it emerged that he had failed to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests.Hunt has amended the register, which now shows that he has a half share of a holiday home in Italy, a half share in an office building in Hammersmith and seven recently acquired apartments in Southampton.Theresa May and Philip Hammond, who both live in Downing Street, rent out their personal homes in central London. Communities and housing secretary Sajid Javid also rents out property, while Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, rents out two properties, according to the registerThe foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the international trade secretary Liam Fox, the minister without portfolio Brandon Lewis – who is also the Conservative party chairman – and the Welsh minister Alun Cairns also own and rent out a property, according to the register.There is no suggestion that the ministers are in breach of the ministerial code.Hunt’s declared property interests are comfortably larger than any of the other ministers listed. He set up Mare Pond Properties Ltd with his wife, Lucia Guo which have since bought seven flats in Alexandra Wharf, a redevelopment project on the Southampton waterfront worth £40m.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only his wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.Kathryn Hudson, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday and will consider it early next week, a spokesperson said. Labour said Hunt’s actions represented a “serious breach”. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: “This is simply unacceptable and especially so given the secretary of state’s position at the heart of Theresa May’s government.”Guardian inquiries have established that the flats were developed by a property company owned by a Conservative donor.The 82-flat luxury block was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property company owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of the complimentary venue hire.Hunt and Roach were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel partly developed by Roachs’ company in Guildford, which is in Hunt’s Surrey constituency.A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase”.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m. The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House’ documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the ministerial code. “We consider the matter closed.” Dr Alex May, the academic who spotted Hunt’s omissions and whose email on 28 March prompted a change to Hunt’s Companies House filing, told the Guardian that the health secretary’s office only admitted wrongdoing after he went public with the information on Friday. “There is a lack of scrutiny from Companies House,” he said. “It allows people to break the law, sometimes unwittingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b22c13d0e561594d85eac3b51f3e47e80fb8a63/0_318_5254_3154/master/5254.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7dc885aee12ad3190fd1c08ea6cfac3c 2600w","title":"jeremy thorpe the charismatic liberal leader who hid dark secrets","story":"A BBC drama recounts the old Etonian’s bizarre story at the heart of a corrupt British establishmentIt’s a long time since the second week of May in 1979 when Jeremy Thorpe arrived in his lawyer’s brown Rolls Royce for the start of the trial that was billed as “the greatest show on earth”.Few people under 40 know who Thorpe even was, let alone the scandal that enthralled the country for more than a month as it unfolded at the Old Bailey. Yet the tale is so bizarre, so improbable and at the same time so revealing of the profound corruption of the British establishment that it seems wilfully irresponsible not to make its study a compulsory part of the national curriculum.Next month might change that. That’s when the BBC airs its star-studded account of the fantastical story of how Thorpe, the old Etonian who had led the Liberal party for a decade from the mid 1960s, faced trial on the charge of conspiracy to murder his former lover.The three-part drama, A Very English Scandal, written by Russell T Davies – responsible for acclaimed hits including Queer as Folk, Casanova and Cucumber – and directed by Stephen Frears, is based on the book of the same name by John Preston. It stars Hugh Grant as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott, the young riding instructor with whom Thorpe conducted an on-off affair.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, remembers Thorpe even before he became party leader. He came to speak to the Liberal club when he was at Cambridge in the mid 1960s. “Jo Grimond was party leader, Thorpe was the entertainment.” Thorpe’s charm didn’t work on Cable, who joined the Labour party.Thorpe was also gay. Early in the 1960s, when he had the affair with Scott, he was the newly elected Liberal MP for North Devon and homosexuality was still illegal. For more than 10 years, the paths of the two men crossed and recrossed, Thorpe’s career advancing as Scott, suffering from recurring mental illness, struggled.Thorpe and his small gang of cronies concluded Scott was a threat to Thorpe and the party. After repeated attempts to silence him, an inner circle began to consider a permanent solution. One of the more arresting claims at the trial was that Thorpe had suggested: “It would be no worse than shooting a sick dog.” How else is it possible to explain the two central questions of the Thorpe affair: why did Thorpe, , an iconoclastic campaigner for human rights and colonial freedom, think it was a sound idea to deal with a perceived threat by arranging the death of the person he feared?Why did it take so long to challenge him? And how, when finally brought to justice, did he get away with it? Thirty-one enthralling days after the trial at the Old Bailey began, Thorpe emerged triumphant, exonerated in law if not in the public esteem.Maybe his bisexuality – he was married, happily, twice and once told a crowd of Oxford undergraduates that he wasn’t married because “why buy a car when you can hire a taxi” – shaped an outlook that instinctively chose secrecy over transparency.Or perhaps the establishment simply preferred not to know. Maybe that curious mix of Whitehall with traditional political allegiances and deep social conservatism that revealed nothing of the dry rot eating its supporting joists, dealt with challenge by ignoring it.Most of the participants are dead. Thorpe himself, cruelly wracked by Parkinsons and still aggrieved never to have been rehabilitated with a seat in the Lords, died in 2014. Only Scott lives on in Devon, not far from the scene of the alleged attempt on his life.It is ancient history. Yet aspects of the trial feel uncomfortably fresh. The leading defence witness, Peter Bessell, was discredited mainly because before the trial he had unwisely flogged a story to the Daily Telegraph detailing what he had been prepared to do for Thorpe before they fell out. Cheque book journalism has never quite gone away.The judge, Sir Joseph Cantley, was a shameless social sycophant whose summing up to the jury, almost indistinguishable from a speech for the defence, dishonoured the reputation of British justice. That might not happen now, but the sense of a system where the avenues to the top are open almost exclusively to a narrow ethnic and social group that is also largely male is still all too familiar.And then there’s the politics.Thorpe was elected leader of his tiny party in 1967, the party’s 12 MPs were the only voters. Thorpe went further and faster than his predecessor, Grimond, developing a radical foreign policy fit for a post-colonial era. And he did it at a time when the plodding conservatism of both the main parties and the renewed radicalism of young voters dramatically magnified the effect.His wit and charm worked as well at a fundraising dinner as in the TV studios or, in the ultimate piece of 1970s symbolism, out wooing seaside holidaymakers from a hovercraft. (“What are you going to say to them?” asked his campaign manager, the MP John Pardoe. “Oh that’s for you to decide,” Thorpe loftily replied.)His alchemist’s touch with money helped to dispel doubts among party members becoming increasingly frustrated by his gang of chums and secretive manner. They didn’t know then how much of the cash he persuaded generous donors, like Jack Hayward, to part with was being erted to deal with his obsessive fear of Scott.And Thorpe was often a lucky politician. Events favoured him. Take Europe it was his tiny party’s votes that allowed the Tory government to steer European legislation through parliament in the early 70s.On the surface, Thorpe continued untarnished – the beguiling, charismatic leader of a minority party that was developing interesting, radical ideas about what politics was for.It was despite rather than because of Thorpe that Liberals discovered pavement politics and began to rebuild their party from the ground up. Yet at least some of this generation of young liberals had been drawn in by Thorpe’s radical energy.Ming Campbell, a former Lib Dem leader, thinks Thorpe’s successor, David Steel, was his real legacy. “What did we get? A son of the manse who shared his radicalism but none of his reputation.” Duncan Brack, a party historian, accepts that Thorpe trashed the brand. Yet, “he propelled the party into people’s consciousness. He got a lot of attention. His success in the two 1974 elections was the basis for the Alliance of the 1980s.”The Lib Dem blogger Mark Pack agrees: “The base that grew in the Alliance days began in his time. When Labour split, the Liberals were a more credible party than they might have been.”This is the Thorpe legacy: a disfigured memorial to the way the establishment could still look after its own even as the forces of modernity slowly washed away at its foundations. Some claim that the scandal changed the establishment for ever. If only.

We decode the new rules for saying helloTwo or three times a week, I leave my young son with a childminder before taking my daughter to nursery. It used to be that, when first meeting the minder or the teacher who was about to take charge of them for the day, I’d grip their upper arm in greeting – a gesture by which I think I meant “Hello” and “Thank you”, as well as something like: “Please don’t let anything happen to them in the foam zone or during scissors time.” A handshake felt too formal in the circumstances, a wave too cold, an embrace too much. There aren’t any cheat sheets or obvious etiquette guides to steer our behaviour in such moments, though, so, like a lot of people, I panicked, winged it, and evolved a near-random habit of greeting that after a while I came to queasily trust was acceptable. Actually, I was feeling pretty confident about that arm squeeze, until I mentioned it to friends.“You do what?” They were incredulous. “You grip the teacher where?”“It’s the forearm,” someone said. “You can only put your hand on the forearm in a relationship like this.”“You can squeeze,” someone said, “lightly.”Someone else said: “Why are you touching them at all? Unless these teachers are, like, your close friends? Or your siblings?”Brits are all over the place when it comes to our methods of physical introduction: inconsistent, contrarian, unsatisfiable. The handshake, a staple to Person A, can seem like barbarian overreach to Person B. Getting a new job might mean trading a huggy workplace for one that’s frostily hands-free, or vice versa, without this switch in protocol being properly explained till you’re there, squeezed under a boss’s armpit, or mutely flicking up eyebrows at some distant colleagues wearing headphones.Perhaps it’s no surprise that we’re puzzled, and puzzling, when it comes to this stuff, given our history. Fiercely codified Edwardian mores were force-fed through two wars, and what jumble of habits remained after that pushed on through postwar immigration, the eroding of an overripe class system, waves of sexual and political change, shifting inclinations to imitate Europeans and Americans, the warping effects of communication by computer and text message, as well as those recent pause-for-thought moments brought about by the #MeToo campaign. Not to mention the endless seesawing shifts in fashion that brought in and out of use the customised handshake, stratagems for clutching, the peace sign, air-kissing. What a mess. What a minefield.After my fright with the upper-arm squeeze, I wondered what else I was doing differently from other people. So over a few weeks I surveyed more than 50 people on the subject, all British or Britain-based but of different ages, backgrounds, sexualities, regions, cultures and employment. The youngest respondent was 19, the oldest 79. Some people had been quietly stewing on these things for years, and others had never properly analysed their actions before. I asked about habits and uncertainties, where people were inconsistent and where they wished for greater clarity, and what suggestions they had to help us normalise this shambles.I heard many intriguing admissions, offered on the condition of anonymity, for instance about the lifelong best friends who never touched in greeting (“We bow our heads slightly”) or the people who’d never so much as hugged their fathers (“I’m not sure his body knows how to contort itself into a hugging position”). People talked me through Ghanaian hand-slaps (“You do it with enthusiasm and gusto, and then click the other person’s fingers”) and Turkish hand-kisses (“You kiss the back of an elder’s hand and place it on your forehead briefly”).Only on one subject was there broad agreement: mums. Mums get a hug and a kiss in greeting for most people this was the one uncomplicated, unhesitating transaction that came naturally.A number of those I interviewed described an everyday clumsiness around their siblings (“My brothers get a nod and an ‘All right’, unless it’s Eid or a funeral or one of us is leaving on a massive trip”) but this was nothing like the pickle people got into around their fathers. A male market trader told me that he and his dad had settled on “three to four kisses per year” – their difficulty was knowing if and when an occasion was exceptional enough to use them. A schoolboy was unbothered (“I don’t use any means of physical contact to greet my father”) but among older men a note of yearning was more common if they did not feel able to kiss or embrace their dads: “I sort of shake hands with him, but then hold the hand, briefly.”A TV producer said: “I’ll usually greet my dad with a wave and a nod. He’s always been a big disciplinarian, typically African and proud, and living in England for over 35 years hasn’t changed that.” Among those who were comfortable kissing their fathers, there were other complications. “My dad gets an awkward hug and he kisses my head,” said a female respondent. A standup comedian said she’d had to come to terms with funny glances coming her way whenever she gave her dad “a quick peck on the lips. It does seem odd to other people, but we’ve always done it and it’s never led to incest.”I was most struck by the response from a security guard, who said that before his father died they used to greet each other with the same routine: firm handshake, followed by sloppy double kiss. It was as if the handshake, like some formal red tape that had to be taken care of, allowed them into a looser intimacy.A teacher was unabashed: hugs are in. “Teaching is like that: at the end of the week, it’s hugs for close colleagues.” Those who worked in offices were more likely to balk at contact. “I like a wave and a ‘Hey’,” said a solicitor, which seemed the view of the majority. In offices where the no-contact greeting is standard, the rules seem to get compromised after any sort of holiday or break from the daily routine. “It’s chaos. I’ve kissed ears, shaken an extended fist, had my handshake crushed against a groin as they’ve hugged me.”People note the inconsistencies brought about by after-work drinks or seasonal parties – particularly saying goodbye at the end. The boss at a management consultancy said: “I often take a faux phone call, to escape the milling.” Quite a few women made the same complaint: why should they be expected to follow up a handshake with a kiss, only because they were women? A film-maker said: “Posh men do this – they pull you in by the hand, and once they instigate it, it’s very hard to get out of.” One recent improvement, though: “I have definitely had my knee patted a lot less since the #MeToo movement.” The solicitor added: “I would far prefer it if it was customary for women as well as men to do just handshakes it would put women on the same footing from the get-go.”‘High five, without fail’: other people’s childrenPeople spoke of improvising their own special technique for greeting children, anything from fond to frosty, but there was no consensus. “Head pat… Hair ruffle… Enthusiastic wave… A curt nod and a please-move-on-now look… I kneel down to their level and ask if they are all right… High five, without fail, normally making them miss the first time… Ironic handshake… High five and a lot of noise… I sort of lean into their faces and boom ‘Hello’ in what’s probably quite a distressing way.”Bending to a child’s level felt important to people. But a father of three smartly pointed out: “They don’t care either way.”A 19-year-old told me that “physical contact among people my age is optional. We settle for a simple ‘Hi’ or ‘Hello’, unless you haven’t seen each other in a while, are best friends or in a romantic relationship.” Most older respondents stated a fondness for personalised greetings. “If I really like someone, I give their back a rub while I hug, like they’re a good horse. For those I’m closest to, I’ll pause after the initial hug and then squeeze.”Stress levels began to rise, people said, when it came to managing these customised hellos all at once. Respondents spoke about circling living rooms or pubs, trying to remember their levels of intimacy with friends on the fly. “One- or two-arm hug? Arm clutches? Or no arm clutches?” A few told stories about awkwardly upgrading their greetings package so that it matched that of the cherished person present – and suddenly there they were in long, rocking bear-hugs with near strangers. Friends’ partners, apparently, present special difficulties. “Strangely dodgy territory,” one respondent said, matching the feelings of about a quarter of those I interviewed. People reported that greetings might come flavoured with frisson (“Sometimes one or other of you goes for the extra kiss and it produces that moment, where you almost kiss on the lips”) or something like stage fright (“There’s a sort of hallway freeze”). A Muslim woman said: “I’m not supposed to have that much physical contact with dudes and I used to find it very weird to get kissed on the cheek by my ex-husband’s mates.” A mother of two said: “My best friend’s husband makes it clear he doesn’t want to be kissed. He sticks out his cheek and says a loud air-kissing ‘Mwah’ which is a rigmarole we go through about once a fortnight.”Apart from a sweet, softly spoken poetry academic, who felt that an absolute bone-crusher of a handshake “should be taught in schools”, the men I interviewed mostly hated having their fingers vice-squashed in greeting. “Deeply twatty,” said a chief executive from North Yorkshire. A charity worker agreed: “It’s so pathetic and yet it feels inappropriate to call them out on it in public.” A van driver admitted: “I was once advised to firm up my handshake. Some people associate it with success and confidence. I associate it with fear.”There was a surprising amount of sympathy for the strong handshake among female respondents. A student from Manchester said: “I quite like it, it feels important”, and a TV producer said: “I like them. But you need to engage with your eyes as well or don’t bother.” Absolutely nobody came out in defence of the alternative. “Don’t slide your hand towards me like a limp fish,” said the female ad exec. “Commit.”There was a high degree of paranoia when it came to the number of kisses: a question to which the answers displayed more class- and geography-based conflict than anywhere else.A police officer said: “Single, always the single kiss”, while a screenwriter gently suggested otherwise: “Maybe two if they initiate.” An architect approached the matter in terms of aesthetics: “There’s got to be something about being symmetrical, right?” An entrepreneur who’d trial-and-errored his way through the numbers had concluded that “the single is creepy, the triple absurd”. (A charity worker disagreed. “I love the novelty value of a triple.”) An academic noted with approval the method of a colleague “who says, as she goes in, ‘I take three’”, while an editor just sounded tired: “I’m not a fan of the kiss on the cheek as a greeting full stop. It’s a posh-white-people thing.” Actually, a lot of people said something like this. A post office worker stated: “Kissing people is definitely a posh thing.” A medical researcher confessed: “I’m northern, this never comes up, apart from when I’m down south, and then I just do as instructed.”A woman in her 30s had had enough. “Just the one. And say clearly, ‘I just do the one.’”What to take from all this? For a while, after I’d listened to and digested all these anxieties and opinions, my methods of introduction became a little wild – erratic. Over a week of nursery drop-offs, I cycled through some alternative greeting methods, trialling one person’s suggestion of “a general wave” and then another, “the footballers’ handclutch”. Neither felt right. I drifted back to the arm squeeze: forearms only, to be safe.In other parts of life I tried to take on the more sensible-sounding advice: bending down to address children medium-squeezing offered hands double-kissing posh southerners and trying to read prompts from everyone else, before kissing them. Actually, wiser respondents had advised something like this in all scenarios. Make eye contact and smile as you greet people at that point, if in doubt, be led by them.More than anything, I kept thinking about a retiree I spoke to. She was about to turn 80 and had put a lot of thought and worry into all of this stuff over the years. How stupid it all seemed to her now. “We spend so much time and effort showing each other we like each other. It’s wasted,” she said. If she could instigate a new rule, whenever people met, “We’d all just… nod.”• Commenting on this piece?

Having looked like becoming a hot favourite when the weights were revealed two months ago, he remains a very reasonable price at 12‑1 and can give his trainer, Willie Mullins, a second success in the race he first won with Hedgehunter in 2005.Some will be put off by the fact that he fell when last seen but I can forgive that tumble, at the third-last in a typically hot Cheltenham Gold Cup. Many a good horse has been caught out by that fence and although the National field usually goes a strong pace, it is unlikely to match the Gold Cup for intensity.Timeform published some numbers this week showing that horses who fell last time out have a weak record in the National over the past decade. But those with longer memories will recall Rhyme N Reason falling in the 1988 Gold Cup and then landing the National the following month, while Red Marauder fell at the first fence in his prep run before winning at Aintree in 2001.The owner JP McManus also has a big chance of a second National success, though possibly not with his most obvious contender, Anibale Fly, whose jumping is not to be trusted. His Carlingford Lough is a class horse on a fair weight and has usually shown his best form in the second half of a season. Regal Encore also has each-way possibilities at big odds. Tiger Roll has to be on the short list after his cross-country success at Cheltenham, though he cannot be relied upon for a similarly doughty effort on back-to-back starts. Milansbar only just misses my top four and can keep Bryony Frost in contention for a long way. Conditions are possibly not quite attritional enough for Raz De Maree or Houblon Des Obeaux but both will appeal to each-way or place-only punters.2.25 The hugely promising and unbeaten On The Blind Side missed Cheltenham because of a minor setback but will be all the fresher here and can sustain the stable’s fine run.3.00 Petit Mouchoir had a hard race last month, so this is a fine chance for Shantou Rock.3.40 Blinkers helped Paper Lantern to an impressive Easter win at Fairyhouse and he may be hard to catch if they do the trick again.4.20 Having fared best of the British runners well when third in the Stayers’ Hurdle, Wholestone can take this less-demanding contest."},{"url":null,"title":"grand national 2018 a horse by horse betting guide","story":"We go through the runners for the 2018 edition of the world’s most famous horse raceWon the Irish Grand National in 2015, beating Rule The World at level weights, form which looked pretty good when the runner-up won the next year’s Grand National. Has not won since and yet somehow remains 6lb higher than for his Fairyhouse success. Was not to blame for his jockey being knocked out of the saddle in this last year but harder to make excuses for his falls in his last two races, since he got about halfway up the fence on each occasion and was under no great pressure at the time. The ability is probably still in there somewhere.Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Has been useful and consistent around the northern tracks this winter but it’s hard to believe he has the class for this and his stamina seems to have been exposed by weak finishing efforts in his last two starts.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3932ab78b3cccef81020a8e73d7b1d8e674459a5/67_16_3449_2070/master/3449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1e9765b761ee7e20a78e2bbc8b8b8867 1240w","title":"england test tea top six cricket pakistan series","story":"It seems the same batsmen from the disastrous Test winter will keep their spots against Pakistan, despite the fact they are England’s weakest top six of the modern ageNobody ever feels completely ready for the start of the English cricket season but here it is all the same, blooming up out of the April mulch with an agreeably heavyweight opening round of fixtures on Friday. As ever it is a part of this process to feel a bit anxious. A sense of decorative decay, of fighting constantly for space and air has always been a part of cricket in England.This is, after all, a sport where the entire season tends to fold together into a microcosm of a single family day out at the English seaside, a five-month blur of travel, wet shoes, existential gloom, the consolations of ritual food and familiar faces, and buried somewhere along the way those brief, chancy moments of sun-drenched beauty that end up defining the entire experience in a snapshot.There is an extra layer of uncertainty this time around, something nagging away just out of sight at the start of the seven-Test summer. Sporting anxieties come in various shades. This one is highly specific and also something of a tell when it comes to wider currents of change.Yes, it’s the top six! It’s Cook-Stoneman-Vince-Root-Malan-Stokes, incumbent members of England’s Test match top six, which was once a matter of vital shared urgency but has become an oddly troubling thing, a little strange, a little distant and blurred.England’s No 3. England’s No 5. These are important people. Knowing exactly who they are at any given moment is a bit like knowing who the current James Bond is or the latest Doctor Who. The first really epic‑feeling top six I can remember was England’s 1985 Ashes powerhouse: Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson at the top, followed by the miracle of David Gower at No 3, swaying and bobbing in his wide-brimmed hat, like the most inely talented scarecrow ever to raise a bat and below him the reassuringly paunchy, sweating rump of Gatting-Lamb-Botham.Fast forward to the present day and it seems the same batsmen from England’s disastrous Test winter will keep their spots against Pakistan next month. This despite the fact there is a fair statistical argument they add up to England’s weakest top six of the modern age.Trevor Bayliss has already announced the cupboard is bare when it comes to alternatives, a masterstroke of demotivation for every single current county cricketer and a statement that confirms the impression of Bayliss as a lavishly rewarded head coach who is not only unmoved by Test cricket but also inconvenienced by its basic existence, wincing and prevaricating beneath his floppy hat like a crisis-ridden minor shadow cabinet minister ambushed by TV cameras on a fishing trip.Meanwhile the basic notion of the Test match top six, its primacy as a thing, continues to atrophy. There have been periods of fragility before but this top six feels different: miscast and a little vague, a product of carelessness and category mistake.Even the openers feel wrong. Alastair Cook has been a giant of English cricket, a patch of cold white light in the middle of all that gruelling heat. But he plays now with a constant flinch, most often seen wandering off with that air of wounded nobility, a minor central European monarch being marched through the palace colonnades en route to his own impeachment.Mark Stoneman has been a fun addition, an opener, finally, who strikes the ball aggressively. But when playing the short ball like a man swatting flies with a frying pan is no longer reason to be dropped as an England opener, then we might as well all give up.No 3 remains an odd kind of problem. The ideal Test No 3 has some base note of genuine aristocratic talent. Brian Lara came jogging out still casually putting on bits of kit, waggling at the buckles of his pads, as though he’d just tumbled out of bed and into the Rolls and down the pavilion steps. James Vince does have a real beauty in his batting, most obviously in that easy yawning drive through the covers. But it seems pretty obvious Joe Root at No 4 scoring fifties should be Joe Root at No 3 scoring hundreds, defining this team from the tipping point.Below him, Ben Stokes at six is pretty much the only real note of authenticity, a No 6 who comes out as all No 6s should, in a genuine fury, reeking of cigars and body odour, with a sense of bristling disdain for his opponents, for the five batsmen ahead of him and for the five still to come.So what now? As ever, this becomes a discussion about changing times, talent-drain, old forms being shunted to one side like an outdated combine harvester. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Test cricket is not dead. There is no reason to accept this. The product is still good. It just needs some care, to be nursed along as it always has been, not to be abandoned or left to wither while T20 defines itself on another stage.For now, England need to rip out the cobwebs, to take a chance on talent, to give the Test team the same invigorating approach afforded the white-ball line-up. Get Jonny Bairstow up the order. Haseeb Hameed needs to play, and keep playing. We can handle it. Just give us a team and a top six to believe in, while the memory that all this matters still remains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ab55a2eec0455c6b522582b220a89d0f4c899d/87_41_2846_1992/master/2846.jpg?w=2750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d7d8afb73d7606b8fc3401692e1522 5500w","title":"the unseen red rum in pictures","story":"After Red Rum’s second Grand National victory in 1974, Jeremy Hoare was invited by trainer Ginger McCain to meet and photograph the legendary racehorse at his Southport Yard.

Three of the four spots have now been claimed, with South Africa playing Scotland for the last just as soon as Papua New Guinea’s game against Malaysia is completed (they’re still in the first half, with PNG 5-0 up).Just three gold medals are still to be awarded today, and the hosts could win all of them:After two rounds of the men’s 10m platform final, Australia’s Domonic Bedggood is out on his own in first place and absolutely on fire (fortunately he keeps jumping into a swimming pool, thereby putting himself out).The men’s hockey gold medal match is ongoing, and Australia have just taken a 2-0 lead over New Zealand, with a couple of minutes of the second period remaining.A few minutes ago Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford won gold in the men’s doubles table tennis, coming back from 2-1 down to beat Sharath Achanta and Sathiyan Gnanasekaran of India 3-2. India did win bronze in the same event, and earlier Manika Batra secured gold for the in the women’s singles. Pitchford, meanwhile, will go for a second gold tomorrow, in the mixed doubles.The run of badminton bronze medal matches have slipped under the radar, but in summary: Malaysia took third place in the men’s doubles, India in the women’s doubles. Kirsty Gilmour won bronze for Scotland in the women’s singles, and England’s Rajiv Ouseph got the medal in the men’s. The Mixed doubles bronze medal match, the last of the day, is ongoing, between Malaysia and India (Ashwini Ponnappa, who won bronze in the women’s doubles, is back on court). Malaysia took the first game 21-19, and lead 7-6 in the second as I type.The 201st and final boxing bout of the Games is over, and by a unanimous points decision Burton’s Frazer Clarke takes super-heavyweight gold after three fine and close rounds against India’s Satish Kumar. England had seven boxing finalists today, and have won six golds (Northern Ireland weren’t involved in this fight but had a contrasting experience over the final day, turning six finals into six silvers).Here’s Cambage reacting to her ejection, with a top-notch quizzical “you-what?” expression followed by a smiling farewell wave to the crowd. The Cambage ejection is something of a basketballing sensation. General consensus seems to be that it was somewhere between harsh and inexplicable, but here’s an attempt to explain it:New Zealand have just become the second team to qualify for the rugby semi-finals: they needed to beat Canada in their final pool game, and have done so by the emphatic score of 33-7.Drama in the basketball, where Australia lead England 49-31 at half time but are without their star player, the giant Liz Cambage, who has been ejected for abusing the referee. “She mouthed off to the ref, got ejected, then walked down the tunnel giving the crowd a big two handed wave with a big grin on her face,” writes my colleague Mike Hytner.At the Optus Aquatic Centre, the final ing event of the Games is about to get under way: the men’s 10m platform final. The preliminary event, which happened in the very early hours of this morning UK time, ended with England’s Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams in first and second, and they will thus go last in the final.Back to the boxing: Vikas Krishan of India won the men’s 75kg, and then Sammy Lee from Swansea takes the men’s 81kg. There is now but one match to go today, the men’s +91kg final, between England’s Frazer Clarke and India’s Satish Kumar.Australia lead 26-10 after the first quarter, and have been extremely impressive so far. Australia’s results in this competition to date: 113-53, 100-61, 118-55 (against England) and 109-50.Australia and England are also playing in the women’s basketball gold medal game, which has just started. Australia lead 7-6 as I type, and in the 6ft 7in Elizabeth Cambage have a player who absolutely dwarfs everyone else involved.England have finished Pool B with 26-17 victory over Australia to qualify for the rugby sevens semi-finals at the expense of the hosts. The three other semi-finalists remain to be decided, with the pool matches continuing over the next couple of hours.The day’s first ing final ends with Canada’s Jennifer Abel pipping Australia’s Maddison Keeney by a wafer-thin 0.4 points, with another Australian in Anabelle Smith 30 points behind in third. Between them Canada and Australia hoovered up the top five spots.The men’s hockey bronze medal match is over, and as in the women’s event England have beaten India. This was an altogether closer affair, though, with Sam Ward scoring twice in a 2-1 win.New Zealand have won silver in the women’s basketball, beating Canada 74-58. The gold medal game, between Australia and England, starts in 10 minutes or so.It’s a clear and unanimous victory for McCormack against a subdued Walsh, who like his sister ends up with silver.Elsewhere in the Oxenford Studios, the final squash match of the day was won by Australia’s Dnna Urquhart and Cameron Pilley, who defeated India’s Dapika Pallikal Karthik and Saurav Ghosal 2-0.Catching up on a bit of boxing, England’s Peter McGrail beat Northern Ireland’s Kurt Walter in the men’s 56kg final bout, and next up is the men’s 69kg final, featuring Aidan Walsh – whose sister Michaela was distraught to come second to Sky Nicolson in the women’s 57kg final an hour and a half ago – and England’s Pat McCormack, whose twin brother Luke won bronze yesterday in the 64kg.India have equalised in the hockey, and it’s now 1-1 with three minutes of the second period to go.The latest boxing final – the women’s 75kg – ends with success for Lauren Price, who used to play football for Wales and has just won boxing gold for them. Australia’s Caitlin Parker has to make do with silver.Earlier today England’s women thrashed India 6-0 in the women’s hockey bronze medal match. The men’s hockey bronze medal match is in progress now, and again it’s India against England. The English are winning this one too, but it’s only 1-0 with 12 minutes of the second period remaining.The women’s 3m springboard ing final is under way, and after the first round Australia’s Esther Qin is in the lead, with Canada’s Jen Abel and Pam Ware second and third, and England’s Alicia Blagg fourth.Another split decision, and Derby’s Sandy Ryan has beaten Rosie Eccles of Wales in the women’s 69kg final. Six more golds will be handed out at Oxenford Studios inside the next couple of hours, so hold on to your hats.Michaela Walsh of Northern Ireland thought she’d won it, and it couldn’t be closer – all five judges have it at 29-28, two favouring Walsh – but Skye Nicolson takes it! Nicolson is from the Gold Coast, and the decision is deliriously received, but Walsh is on the floor. It’s her second successive Commonwealth Games silver, and she doesn’t look happy to get it.The first squash bronze medal match is over, and New Zealand’s Joelle King and Paul Coll have bulldozed England’s Alison Waters and Daryl Selby, by two games to love. A few hours ago Selby and Adrian Waller won their all-English men’s doubles semi-final, so he’ll have another chance of a medal tomorrow.Australia will play England in the netball gold medal match!

Good luck.Guardian tip: Ah LittleluckJust had a quick word with the PR reps from Paddy Power and Ladbrokes Coral to get an idea of what’s being backed in today’s Grand National. The two names that both mentioned were Tiger Roll and I Just Know.Names are important, according to Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes, who reports the firm’s four worst results would be Chase The Spud, I Just Know, Tiger Roll or Seeyouatmidnight. “The rest, we’d be happy enough.”McGeady reckons those names all appeal to “recreational, once-a-year punters”, especially Chase The Spud. French names, in contrast, are offputting. “We expected Baie Des Iles to be popular, being a grey with Katie Walsh aboard, but if it’s hard for punters to say it, they’re not backing it,” she added.Everything in today’s Grand National is available at 14-1 or bigger if you shop around and we believe that would be a record price for a favourite if it lasted until the ‘off’. But it won’t, of course. Lots of prices will be cut in the last hour before the race and something will surely go off at 10-1 or maybe shorter. We just don’t know what it is yet. If you fancy one, take the price now and don’t just accept the starting price.There was a terrific interview with Richard Pitman on Racing UK this morning. Pitman was on board Crisp when he finished second to Red Rum in 1973, his horse putting up arguably the single most impressive performance ever around Aintree, carrying 12 stone and only just failing to beat Red Rum who was carrying 10st 5lb. Pitman reminded his interviewer, Steve Mellish, that the following season they met at level weights at Doncaster and Crisp beat his old rival eight lengths. Crisp was scheduled to run again in the National but came back with an injury after that victory and did not race again.There was just one faller from 27 runners in Friday’s Topham Chase and there’s no question that the Grand National fences are not the fearsome monsters they used to jump when your grandad was betting in shillings. I can’t agree with those who see that as something to regret, however.I walked round the course this morning and was reminded afresh of how big those fences are. The tops of most of them were above my eye-level as I approached. If you put me on a horse and pointed me at just one of those, all alone, it’d give me a scare and a thrill. Put me among 39 others and tell me to do two circuits faster than the rest, well … I can’t imagine there’s another job in sport more calculated to fill you with adrenaline.Yes, a horse can plough through one of these fences and then keep going, which was certainly not true until they took the timber cores out a few years ago. But those horses pay a price, in the physical toll taken by going through the fence rather than over it. If they’re strong enough to hold their place in the field despite a mistake like that, good like to them. I can’t imagine any horse can win the Grand National after more than one such blunder.The important thing is that tiring horses are not punished. Some National runners, just about to fade out of contention, reach a point where they just can’t get high enough at the next fence and in the old days, that might result in one of those hideous rotational falls that are such an obvious risk of spinal injuries in horses, and indeed jockeys. Now, such a horse can bash his way through the fence and be pulled up on the landing side, tired but able to face another day. It seems like progress to me.There will very likely be no better National horse than Red Rum. This week I went to the Osborne Studio Gallery in Motcomb St, London for the opening of an excellent exhibition of photographs taken by Jeremy Hoare of the great runner. Here’s a gallery of some of Hoare’s unseen snaps from 1974.The way newspaper tipsters have cast their votes is an indicator of what an open Grand National this is. The picks of 16 tipsters are faithfully recorded by the Racing Post and they generally gravitate towards the more obvious horses, with eight votes for the favourite in the 3pm race and seven for the favourite in the 3.40. For the Grand National itself, not one horse has been picked by more than two tipsters. Here’s the list of horses put up by various papers today:Anibale Fly 2 picksI Just Know 2Houblon Des Obeaux 2Total Recall 2Blaklion 2Seeyouatmidnight 2Raz De Maree 1Tiger Roll 1Milansbar 1Vieux Lion Rouge 1So the combined genius of Fleet Street has managed to recommend more than a quarter of the field. What are the poor readers supposed to make of it all, eh?Walking the track is one of the great traditions on the morning of the National and I’ve been down at Becher’s Brook during the race in the 1980s when there WAS a brook and it was properly fearsome. Chris Cook has been out on a once-round walk today (don’t forget the horses have to go round twice!) and you can read his comments as he made his way around Aintree on his Twitter feed. The big plunge horse of this year’s National is definitely Baie Des Iles. His rider, Katie Walsh, is the most likely of the three female jockeys to make history and he’s grey. At the start of the week Baie Des Iles was 80-1 and now he’s a best-priced 18-1. There will be plenty of women supporting Walsh by having a bet and I was intrigued by the comments made by Alexander Kostin of bonuscodebets.co.uk this week, who claims that online betting is drawing more female punters in and that this year for the National they could outnumber men. You will be bored by 5.15pm today hearing everyone waffle on about the great potential stories in the National. The first female rider Trevor Hemmings becoming the most successful Grand National-winning owner of all-time the father-and-son trainer and jockey combinations involved in Blaklion and Captain Redbeard and so on. But what about a Guardian journalist winning the race? Normally that’s only if one of our punts is successful, but Professor Caroline Tisdall, the art critic at the Grauniad in the 1970s, owns Vieux Lion Rouge and the horse is far from out of it.Regal Encore and Walk In the Mill will not take part in the Grand National after being withdrawn from the race.The former was withdrawn after a blood analysis taken from the horse was found to be abnormal. The horse’s absence leaves owner JP McManus with three runners, Anibale Fly, Carlingford Lough and Pendra.Walk In The Mill was only third reserve for the National when the declarations were made on Thursday but got into the race 11 minutes before Friday’s 1pm cut-off point after Beeves was declared a non-runner.Sam Waley-Cohen, one of the best riders around Aintree, is now without a ride after the Baroness Harding-owned eight-year-old was found to be lame on Saturday morning.Good morning from the north-west of England, where there is still a fair amount of cloud cover but the feel of the day is altogether different to Friday. It doesn’t feel as though it could rain at any moment, basically, and the Grand National course might even dry out just a little ahead of a race that is still more than six-and-a-half hours away.The damage was done on Friday, though. We have become somewhat accustomed to seeing the Grand National field rattling along on good-to-soft ground at worst in recent seasons but today’s race could be a throwback to the muddy slogs of yore. Hopefully, though, it will not be quite as attritional as the last renewal on heavy ground, when just four horses completed the course and two of those had been remounted after unseating their riders.Red Marauder’s National is now almost 20 years in the past, and took place during the extended foot-and-mouth outbreak which had already forced the abandonment of the Cheltenham Festival. With that in mind, the much-respected Timeform’s comments about the race are worth recalling.“Just when National Hunt racing needed an epic Grand National to restore an appearance of normality to the season,” Timeform wrote, “instead of Ben Hur it got Carry On Cleo, though without the laughs for this was, arguably, not only a farce – a third of the field had their race ended by interference from loose horses - but a potential public relations disaster narrowly avoided.”Is there a potential public relations disaster in store today? Well, it needs to be remembered that a good deal has changed at Aintree since then, in part at least as a result of that race. Paddy’s Return, the loose horse that caused a pile-up at the Canal Turn on the first circuit and effectively took out 15 horses, did so because there was nowhere for him to run out and so he turned and ran along the take-off side of the fence instead. Run-out areas were in place the following year – another example of the Grand National introducing sensible change where necessary – and the fences are also now a good deal more forgiving.The Topham Chase over the Grand National course on Friday was interesting in this respect, as there were 14 finishers from 27 starters and just one genuine faller among the 13 that failed to complete. Seven horses were pulled up, while five unseated their riders. Last year, on good ground, there were seven fallers and only two unseats.The evidence of just two years is, of course, fairly meaningless in the grand scheme, but I can’t help wondering whether this might have something to do with speed at which the horses are jumping the new fences. On slower ground, it is possible at least that a horse which catches the plastic core will lose enough momentum to unship its rider, but not enough to actually fall.The heavy ground aside, today’s National promises to be everything that any punter could wish for. The relentless analysis of the race among devotees from the moment the weights are published in mid-February means that we sometimes lose sight of the fact that the National’s is designed to appeal to once-a-year backers, having what amounts to a lucky dip, and this year it is difficult to find anything what is now a 38-runner field that does not go to the start with at least a glimmer of hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18b7645e69f3dd47e21e24cac5517b1676b35db/13_62_3316_1989/master/3316.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=88bd69962244abfcf459280a7f53a6e2 1240w","title":"google loses right to be forgotten case","story":"Businessman wins legal action to force removal of search results about past convictionA businessman has won his legal action to remove search results about a criminal conviction in a landmark “right to be forgotten” case that could have wide-ranging repercussions.The ruling was made by Mr Justice Warby in London on Friday. The judge rejected a similar claim brought by a second businessman who was jailed for a more serious offence. The claimant who lost, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s the claimant who won, known as NT2, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiracy to intercept communications. NT1 was jailed for four years, while NT2 was jailed for six months.Granting an appeal in the case of NT1, the judge added: “It is quite likely that there will be more claims of this kind, and the fact that NT2 has succeeded is likely to reinforce that.”Both men demanded that Google remove search results mentioning the cases for which they were convicted. These include links to web pages published by a national newspaper and other media. Google refused their request and the men took the company to the high court.The decision in NT2’s favour could have implications for other convicted criminals and those who want embarrassing stories about them erased from the web. Warby ruled out any damages payment, however.Explaining his decision, the judge said NT1 continued to mislead the public, whereas NT2 had shown remorse. He also took into account the submission that NT2’s conviction did not concern actions taken by him in relation to “consumers, customers or investors”, but rather in relation to the invasion of privacy of third parties.He said his key conclusion in relation to NT2’s claim was that “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability”. In the case of NT1, however, the judge was scathing about the claimant’s position since leaving prison. “He has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters,” he said.“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimising the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.”In 2014 the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engine firms can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy.At a high court hearing in February, Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing NT1, told the high court that the visibility of the articles on the search engine caused “distress and upset” to his client.Tomlinson, who is also chairman of the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living from commercial lending and funding a property developer.“Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson said. He added that many people engaged in misdeeds when they were young and if the misdeeds were constantly brought to the attention of others then they would permanently have a negative effect.NT1’s conviction was now spent, Tomlinson continued, and the law was designed to allow for the rehabilitation of offenders so they could go on to lead normal lives.But Antony White QC, representing Google, argued the ECJ’s “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”.White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”.NT2, in a separate hearing, also argued that his conviction was legally spent and he therefore had a right to be forgotten. Google resisted taking down search results linking to articles including reports on his financial affairs, his conviction and interviews given by him several years later containing his account of the circumstances surrounding his conviction.A Google spokesperson said: “We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information. We are pleased that the court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous was incapable of sensible thought thanks to her insatiable appetite for champagne Bernard Black in Black Books stoked his misanthropy with wine. The characters in M*A*S*H were often drunk to blunt the trauma of war. And in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia – just because they felt like it. Bit-part comedy drinkers range from exaggerated monsters such as Father Jack in Father Ted and Barney Gumble in The Simpsons to the flippantly presented misery of Fun Bobby in Friends – Monica’s boyfriend who became “Ridiculously Dull Bobby” as soon as he wasn’t sloshed.Recently, however, comedy has sobered up. On Netflix, Flaked sees Will Arnett play an alcoholic rebuilding his life. One half of the couple in Channel 4’s Catastrophe is a reformed drinker. In Love, the slacker sitcom whose third season has recently launched on Netflix, protagonist Mickey realises she’s an addict – of love and sex, but also alcohol and drugs – and starts to visit AA meetings. Meanwhile, Loudermilk, which appeared on Amazon Prime Video in January, stars Ron Livingston as Sam Loudermilk, an embittered Seattle orcee who leads an addiction group and is himself an alcoholic in recovery.“I’ve never met an alcoholic I didn’t like,” says Loudermilk co-creator Peter Farrelly, for whom the show is a move into more adult TV comedy after a career spent making wilfully crass movies such as Dumb and Dumber. “Such a big flaw humanises people, it makes them way more interesting. Right away the likability is up. Loudermilk is the ultimate asshole but because we know his flaws, we put up with it.”Comedy’s thirst for teetotalism extends as far as mainstream sitcom Mom, which features Allison Janney and Anna Faris as a mother and daughter who are both in recovery. But sobriety is particularly suited to the new wave of nuanced, funnyserious “dramedy”, where the “sit” doesn’t reset neatly to zero and the characters’ mental health is in the foreground. A drinker whose recovery could derail at any point perfectly fits that bill.“There’s been a shift towards complicating protagonists in comedies,” observes AV Club critic Kyle Fowle. “Streaming services, and tastes in general, have changed the nature of sitcom: there’s room for punchlines and traditional episodic storytelling, but more often than not viewers want something more complex. Dramedy is interested in serialised storytelling, where conflicts aren’t resolved in a single episode. Shows that have characters struggling with addiction can explore storylines, consequences and triumphs over multiple episodes, while still having that comedy bent.”The danger with comedies about something so serious is the laughs getting lost: either the show’s in poor taste or it’s simply a massive downer. Farrelly knew this was a trap to be avoided. “The thing I’m most proud of is Loudermilk’s not as depressing as most shows I’ve seen with AA-style programmes. Usually they paint a dreary picture of a bunch of sad sacks sitting around talking about their problems. It doesn’t have to be that way. People go to these meetings to be uplifted. There are a lot of laughs. Anyone in the programme will tell you.”“Shows like Loudermilk go back to the idea that there’s a kernel of comedy within every tragedy,” says Steve Greene, a writer at IndieWire. “Part of getting past horrendous things is finding the weird ironies in what comes after.”A sober protagonist also brings in-built tension to a comedy, because their determination to resist booze is a Chekhov’s gun: at some point they’ll succumb. Flaked pulls the trigger at the end of episode one, when we see that the bottle marked “Kombucha” that Will Arnett’s character keeps in the fridge is actually full of wine. Loudermilk retains that uncertainty for as long as possible.In Catastrophe’s very first scene, Rob Delaney’s character uses his drinking problem as an unconventional chat-up line: “I quit a few years ago, after I shit my pants at my sister’s wedding.” This announces the show as being about flawed adults, not sitcom caricatures. Then last year’s more downbeat third season depicted an unhappy “Rob” relapsing.“We knew it was a potential disaster in our back pocket,” says Delaney’s co-star and co-writer Sharon Horgan. “We didn’t even know initially if we’d do anything with it. We just liked the idea that Sharon was someone for whom drink, and getting pissed, was a part of life, and seeing her involved with a sober alcoholic interested us. It took a long time for us to figure out how to deal with Rob falling off the wagon. We didn’t want the show to get so dark that it stopped being funny.”Delaney himself is a sober alcoholic in real life, as is comedian Marc Maron, whose autobiographical sitcom Maron similarly saw the creator’s screen alter ego relapse. This trope of a performer acting out a scenario they hope never happens to them was bleakly flipped by Will Arnett when he made Flaked: after 15 years sober, during filming for season one he started drinking again and had to resume attending AA meetings.Comedians who are willing to put their own trauma on screen are part of a change in culture, with stars increasingly open to discuss mental health. Meanwhile, a steady drip of deaths – Amy Winehouse and Philip Seymour Hoffman being two illustrations of how the battle for sobriety can suddenly be lost – has buried the idea of substance abuse being cool. In the real world, too, millennials drink less than preceding generations, and Dry January gets bigger every year. In this context, an old-school lush might not get laughs.“The fact that recovery is the subject of popular TV, and especially comedies, reflects a change in culture,” says Dr James Nicholls, director of research and policy development at Alcohol Research UK. “We’re more ready to discuss recovery. This is to do with less stigma around mental health issues but also a wider recognition that ‘recovery’ is a positive journey that many people take, and achieve successfully.”Addiction counsellor Simon Leigh agrees, though he points out that the US, the home of these series where recovery is the central theme, is ahead of us: “In America, alcoholism and addiction are treated as an illness. There’s not enough education about addiction in this country. If you have a drinking problem in America you go to rehab. If you have a drinking problem in England you go to the pub!”For the grown-up TV comedies of the 21st century, however, the pub is no longer the place. Heavy drinking used to mean easy laughs now, that well has run dry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b94e67f2c3db9ae7927f16a127c6f120694cc8/222_130_1818_1091/master/1818.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4d7937bb4f940e0f441b214ad5da2f60 1240w","title":"is it time to put have i got news for you out of its misery","story":"Ian Hislop’s recent comments about female hosts being too ‘modest’ to present the show were indicative of the show’s tired and flabby complacency “You’re a patronising git, aren’t you?” said Steph McGovern on last week’s Have I Got News For You (6 April, BBC1, 9.30pm), serving Jeremy Paxman his arse on a plate. As guest host, Paxman isn’t the first man to talk down to a female panellist on the show – this time, delivering supercilious praise when McGovern answered a question correctly – and, as long as it lumbers on, he won’t be the last.Now into its 55th series, HIGNFY squats in the schedules like a smug toad, resolute in its if-it-ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it folly. A festival of schoolboy sniggering, watching it is much like crashing a college reunion that’s gearing up for a rose-tinted game of soggy biscuit. One wonders if Will Self, in describing the show as “the very cockpit of British satire”, wasn’t being so flattering after all. While there are odd glimpses of the old humour, the mood is frequently toxic, with captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton piling in on guests and then scratching their heads when producers struggle to find fresh ones.The most recent upset came when Hislop and Merton were quizzed in the Radio Times about the absence of female guest hosts, specifically women MPs, to which they replied, “Everyone you think should have been asked has been.” The real problem, they decided, is that women are too modest to come on their show. You what, lads? If modesty is how you interpret a woman weighing up her options and deciding she’d rather feast on fire ants in the Australian jungle than endure your special brand of humiliation then perhaps that says more about you than them?Editors could construct a sports-style montage out of the times that Hislop, Merton and male guests have talked over, patronised and bullied female panellists. For some choice lowlights, let me point you to the time Jimmy Carr jeered at Ann Widdecombe, “Ooh, take off your glasses, you’re beautiful”, or when Hislop and Merton interrogated Paula Yates about her breasts and choice of boyfriend. Their modest women theory is particularly precious when you consider the debate surrounding the gender pay gap and the claim made by an economist on a recent Today programme that men are paid more because of “choices freely made”. Apparently structural barriers are a figment of the female imagination, a consequence of all those hormones pulsing through our systems and paralysing our ability to see our own lack of ambition.But back to HIGNFY and the search for the lesser-spotted female MP, which is now, by all accounts, rivalling the hunt for the yeti. Tip-off, chaps: Anna Soubry has said she’s game. But even the presence of more women – more, at least, than one per episode – won’t save this sinking vessel. Last week, Merton, who has napped through the show for at least a decade, did little more than the odd cartoon double take, and left Hislop’s pompous proclamations unpunctured. Meanwhile, Paxman bellowed pointlessly and Josh Widdicombe barely uttered a word. Rarely has a show appeared more tired, more flabby, more blunted by its own complacency. The time has come to put it out of its misery. To go quietly would surely be the modest thing to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the US-led strikes on Syria a “military crime”. According to state news agency IRNA, Khamenei spoke at a meeting with Iranian officials and ambassadors from some Islamic countries.“The attack this morning against Syria is a crime,” Khamenei added later on his Telegram channel. “The American president, the French president and the British prime minister are criminals, they will gain nothing from it.”Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the allied strikes in Syria were a “necessary and appropriate” response to what the US and its allies say was a recent chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma.Merkel said Berlin viewed the US, UK and France had taken “responsibility in this way as permanent members of the UN security council ... to maintain the effectiveness of the international rejection of chemical weapons use and to warn the Syrian regime against further violations”.In a response to questions about the strikes, China’s foreign ministry called any military action that bypasses the UN security council a violation of international law. “We consistently oppose the use of force in international relations, and advocate respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.“China believes that a political solution is the only realistic way out for the Syrian issue,” she added. “China urges all the relevant parties to return to the framework of international law and to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.”The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said those who rely on chemical warfare must be held to account by the world.Juncker said the suspected use of poison gas last week in the Syrian city of Douma was as he puts it a “heinous chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime”. He said the world “has the responsibility to identify and hold accountable those responsible” for the attack.The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who this week ruled out his country’s participation in military action in Syria, announced his unequivocal support for the targeted bombings.“Canada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime’s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people,” he said. Trudeau added that Canada would continue to investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria and that those responsible for the recent attacks “must be brought to justice”.Israel, which was recently accused by Iran of carrying out its own airstrikes on military bases in Syria, was among the first to praise the strikes. “Last year, President Trump made clear that the use of chemical weapons crosses a red line. Tonight, under American leadership, the United States, France and the United Kingdom enforced that line.”The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the actions by the US, France and UK coalition should be supported because they would “reduce the government’s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons”.“Nato has consistently condemned Syria’s continued use of chemical weapons as a clear breach of international norms and agreements,” he said. “The use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable.”Turkey’s foreign ministry said it welcomed the strikes as an “appropriate response”.Ankara said chemical weapons attacks that indiscriminately target civilians “constitute crimes against humanity” and should not go unpunished.UN secretary- general, António Guterres, said that while use of chemical weapons was “abhorrent” and “horrendous”, he urged caution in retaliating, expressing concern that any escalation of the violence would only increase the suffering of those living in Syria.“I urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,” Guterres said in a statement. The strikes carried out by the US, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said, calling the raids “a very dangerous development”. “Such action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,” it said.

Dr Mainen, who worked on AI before moving into study of the human brain, argues that the root cause of human depression is an inability to update their beliefs about the world in the presence of new information. He thinks that this ability, in human brains, is modulated by the chemical serotonin. If you don’t have enough serotonin in your brain, you can’t change your understanding of things easily enough.The broad sweep of this is relatively familiar to people interested in how the brain works....To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your Telegraph account.

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Syria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest news\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesRussia claims its ally Syria shot down 71 of the 103 missiles launched by the US, Britain and FranceJeremy Corbyn condemns Syria strikes as \u0026#39legally questionable\u0026#39Comment: On this day in 1865: John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln at Ford\u0026#39s Theatre, WashingtonComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Earlier this week, his grandson James followed in his footsteps to win a bronze in the 1m springboard.Reid won with a personal best score, ahead of two Australians, and was in tears when the result was confirmed.Grace Reid with her gold medalShe said: “I just loved every second of that. That was unbelievable. My primary goal was to go out and actually enjoy what I do, so job done as far as I’m concerned.“Seeing as this was my third Commonwealth Games, I actually came in with quite a lot of pressure on my shoulders. “I haven’t been sleeping and eating as much as normal because I have been really nervous. But experience came into play and I went into autopilot this evening.“To walk away with the gold medal is just crazy and I would not have believed that had someone suggested it this morning.”The former George Watson’s College pupil, who won a world synchro silver with Tom Daley last year, competes again today\u0026ltSat\u0026gt in her favourite 3m springboard event.Meanwhile, Marshall took his tally of Games medals to five golds and one silver, overtaking the sprinter Allan Wells, with four golds and a silver.He picked up his latest medal in the men’s fours competition with a hard-fought win over Australia.The 51-year-old from East Lothian, who began bowling when he was eight and first represented his country in 1988, said he was now looking forward to 2022.He added: “Becoming the most successful athlete was always in the back of my mind, but today was about getting another medal for Team Scotland.“It’s been a fantastic Games for the entire team and we’re so proud to be a part of that.”There were also bronze medals for the team in bowls, boxing and shooting, taking Scotland’s medal tally - already the biggest at an overseas Games - to 41. The country’s biggest total came four years in Glasgow when, as hosts, the team won 53 medals.However, it is already well ahead of its best previous overseas medal haul of 29, in Melbourne in 2006.Syria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest news\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesRussia claims its ally Syria shot down 71 of the 103 missiles launched by the US, Britain and FranceJeremy Corbyn condemns Syria strikes as \u0026#39legally questionable\u0026#39Comment: On this day in 1865: John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln at Ford\u0026#39s Theatre, WashingtonComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Mr McCabe says that when he believed his answers to the inspector general were misunderstood, he went back and tried to correct them.His lawyer says the inspector general unfairly tried to conclude its work before Mr McCabe could retire with a full pension.The report gave additional fodder for President Donald Trump\u0027s public attacks on Mr McCabe.On Friday night, the president tweeted: \u0026quotDOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!\u0026quotJames Comey, the former FBI director whose new book paints a damning portrait of Donald TrumpThe president has made a concerted and Twitter-driven effort to impugn Mr McCabe as a partisan hack, accusing him of covering up unspecified \u0026quotlies and corruption\u0026quot at the FBI and calling his firing a \u0026quotgreat day for Democracy.\u0026quotMr McCabe has fired back, saying his dismissal was part of the Trump administration\u0027s \u0026quotongoing war\u0026quot on the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s Russia investigation.The report was sent to congressional committees and obtained by The Associated Press.The inspector general\u0027s finding led FBI disciplinary officials to recommend that the Justice Department fire Mr McCabe.Donald Trump, the US president, frequently criticised Mr McCabe before his firingAttorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed him last month two days before his scheduled retirement for what he described as a lack of candor.Mr McCabe also has said he believes he was singled out because of the \u0026quotrole I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath\u0026quot of Mr Comey\u0027s firing.To support this, Mr McCabe has noted that the inspector general\u0027s investigation into him was accelerated after he told congressional investigators that he could corroborate Mr Comey\u0027s accounts of his conversations with Trump.Mr McCabe, who is close to Comey, could be an important witness for Mueller, who is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, including his motivation for firing Mr Comey in May 2017.The Associated Press has also confirmed that Mr McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with the president and they have been provided to the special counsel\u0027s office.Please review our commenting policySyria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest news\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesRussia claims its ally Syria shot down 71 of the 103 missiles launched by the US, Britain and FranceJeremy Corbyn condemns Syria strikes as \u0026#39legally questionable\u0026#39Comment: On this day in 1865: John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln at Ford\u0026#39s Theatre, WashingtonComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

The Government should do whatever possible to push Russia and the United States to agree to an independent UN-led investigation of last weekend\u0027s horrific chemical weapons attack so that those responsible can be held to account.\u0026quotThe leader of the opposition was visiting to Huddersfield on Saturday and spoke to his Conservative counterpart late on Friday. He said: \u0026quotI had a late night conversation with the Prime Minister and my whole point is that Parliament should be consulted, parliament should be allowed to take a view on this but, instead, the strikes were launched last night.\u0026quotParliament is in session on Monday.

This civil war is ghastly.

Pictured is an RAF Tornado GR4 landing at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could be deployed against the Syrian governmentThey \u0026quotare responsible for the regional consequences of this adventurist action,\u0026quot it added.An official in Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday that the fallout from US-led attacks on Syria will be at Washington\u0027s expense.\u0026quotWith this attack...the situation will become more complex, and this will surely be at the expense of the United States, which will be responsible for the aftermath of upcoming regional events that will certainly not be in their interest,\u0026quot Yadollah Javani, the Guards\u0027 deputy head for political affairs, told Fars news agency.Iran is the key backer alongside Russia of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, providing military advisors and \u0026quotvolunteer\u0026quot ground forces.Tehran officials have said Western powers are using last week\u0027s alleged chemical attack on a rebel-held stronghold as an excuse to undermine the Syrian government\u0027s recent successes on the battlefield.Israel said in response to the American-led strike in Syria that the Middle Eastern country\u0027s \u0026quotmurderous actions\u0026quot had put it in danger.An official said in a statement that Mr Trump made clear last year that the use of chemical weapons was a red line not to be crossed.Damascus sky lights up with service to air missile fire as the U.S. launches an attack on Syria targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, Syria, early Saturday, April 14, 2018He said the overnight operation carried out by the United States, France and Britain followed that example. The official said that \u0026quotSyria continues to carry out murderous actions and be a base for these actions and others, including Iran\u0027s, that put its territory, forces and leadership in peril.\u0026quotThe official spoke anonymously according to protocol. There has been no other official Israeli response yet.Israel has issued several stern warnings of late about Iran\u0027s increased involvement along its border in Syria in Lebanon.Air strikes carried out by the United States, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said on Saturday.The air strikes marked a \u0026quota very dangerous development\u0026quot, the ministry said in statement.\u0026quotSuch action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,\u0026quot it said.The ministry called on Arab leaders to discuss the situation at a summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.Saudi Arabia has expressed its full support for US-led strikes on Syrian government military installations, saying they were a response to \u0026quotregime crimes\u0026quot against civilians.\u0026quotSaudi Arabia fully supports the strikes launched by the United States, France and Britain against Syria because they represent a response to the regime\u0027s crimes,\u0026quot a foreign ministry statement said.Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud meets with U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump during a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 20, 2017The statement, carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, said the strikes were prompted by the \u0026quotSyrian regime\u0027s use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians, including women and children\u0026quot.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have been key backers of Syrian opposition groups fighting Assad.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday the air strikes against the Syrian regime were \u0026quotnecessary and appropriate\u0026quot after the suspected chemical weapons attacks that killed dozens in Douma.\u0026quotWe support the fact that our US, British and French allies ... assumed their responsibilities. The military intervention was necessary and appropriate,\u0026quot Merkel said in a statement.\u0026quotEverything leads us to believe that (Assad) bears responsibility\u0026quot for the Douma attack, Merkel said.The chancellor on Thursday had ruled out Germany joining any military action against Syria.On Saturday she said it appeared likely that the Syrian regime \u0026quothad used chemical weapons against its own people on several occasions in the past\u0026quot.Merkel added: \u0026quotA century after the end of World War I... we must fight against the erosion of the (international) convention on chemical weapons\u0026quot.\u0026quotGermany will undertake, in a determined way, diplomatic efforts to support this,\u0026quot Merkel said.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has ruled out Canadian participation in the strikes but said that Canada supports the decision by its allies in the US, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotCanada condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in last week\u0027s attack in eastern Ghouta, Syria,\u0026quot said Mr Trudeau, in a statement issued from Lima, Peru, where he is attending the Summit of the Americas.\u0026quotCanada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u0027s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people.\u0026quotWe will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u0026quotEarlier on Friday, Canada became the latest country to lay the blame for a deadly chemical-weapons attack in Syria last week at Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s doorstep, despite Russian suggestions to the contrary.\u0026quotWhen it comes to this use of chemical weapons, it is clear to Canada that chemical weapons were used and that they were used by the Assad regime,\u0026quot said Chrystia Freeland, Canadian foreign minister.Australia, a staunch ally of the US and a member of the Five Eyes security alliance, was not a part of the attacks on Damascus and Homs, but issued a statement lending its support to the coalition’s actions.Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, said in a statement jointly issued with the foreign and defence ministers: “The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances is illegal and utterly reprehensible.“The Assad regime must not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity.”Mr Turnbull said the strikes were “a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response”.“They send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.”The head of Nato expressed his support for Western strikes in Syria.Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: \u0026quotI support the actions taken by the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotThis will reduce the regime\u0027s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons.\u0026quotUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday called for restraint and for countries to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation in Syria after the United States, France and Britain carried out strikes.Guterres delayed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to deal with the aftermath of the military action.\u0026quotI urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,\u0026quot Guterres said in a statement.\u0026quotAny use of chemical weapons is abhorrent. The suffering it causes is horrendous,\u0026quot Guterres said.The UN chief said it was important to act in line with the UN charter and international law.He urged the UN Security Council to agree on establishing an inquiry that would identify the perpetrators of chemical attacks.European Council president Donald Tusk said the European Union would stand with its allies \u0026quoton the side of justice\u0026quot.\u0026quotStrikes by US, France and UK make it clear that Syrian regime together with Russia \u0026amp Iran cannot continue this human tragedy, at least not without cost,\u0026quot he wrote on Twitter.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU commission, said the use of chemical weapons was \u0026quotunacceptable in any circumstances\u0026quot:Boris Johnson will meet with European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday at a meeting to dominated by the strikes on Syria, James Crisp reports from Brussels. Through the weekend, British diplomats and ministers will be in touch with their EU counterparts to lay the groundwork for discussion over Friday night\u0027s air strikes. EU Ministers are expected to back language condemning the use of chemical weapons in the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council. Before the joint US-UK and French attack, London and Paris was pushing to toughen up the language of the draft joint statement, which will decry the use of chemical weapons and the greying of the international line against their use. Those efforts are continuing. The debate among ministers will include discussion over the strike but also how to prevent the use of chemical weapons in the future and secure a ceasefire in Syria. Mr Johnson can expect support from other EU member states such as Belgium and the Netherlands. The meeting was always going to be important for Britain as it is the first Foreign Affairs Council after Theresa May secured EU support for condemning Russia for the Salisbury attack.The Telegraph understands the conclusions will take a tougher line on Russia and Iran than the statement agreed by EU leaders on March 21. This will not include sanctions at this stage but there is likely to be language stating that option remains on the table. Indonesia expressed concern over the airstrikes while strongly condemning the use of chemical weapons that caused the loss of many innocent lives, Nicola Smith reports.“Indonesia is concerned about unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in response to the chemical weapons attack tragedy in Syria,” foreign ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir said.Jakarta argued that taking military actions without prior authorisation from the UN Security Council was not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes.The country further requests the UN Security Council take immediate steps to resolve the crisis in Syria, reported the Jakarta Post.“For Indonesia, peace and stability in Syria can only be achieved through dialogue and an inclusive political process,” said Mr Arrmanatha.Meanwhile, the Philippine foreign ministry advised all its citizens in Syria to remain in their homes until further notice, said spokesman Elmer Cato.Cato said the Philippine charge d’affaires in Syria, Crescente Relacion, had “described the more or less one hour missile barrage” as “like New Year in Manila.”Please review our commenting policySyria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest newsRussia claims its ally Syria shot down 71 of the 103 missiles launched by the US, Britain and FranceJeremy Corbyn condemns Syria strikes as \u0026#39legally questionable\u0026#39Comment: On this day in 1865: John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln at Ford\u0026#39s Theatre, WashingtonComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival.

Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This line was repeated several times on state television broadcasts.  But, Mr Kosachyov added, now was “not a time for emotions.” Russia’s reaction should instead be guided “by the professional evaluation of military specialists”Russia warns of \u0027consequences\u0027 for US-led strikesThose military specialists seemed to put clear blue water between Russia and the coalition operation. In statements that will reassure Washington — which emphasised targets had been chosen away from Russian infrastructure — the Russian Ministry of Defence said it had consciously not engaged its own defence systems. “None of the missiles landed in any of the areas under the responsibility of Russian air defence systems in Tartus and Khmeimime, it said in a statement. Syrian sources also emphasised that Russia had warned them in advance of the likelihood of air attacks, and had evacuated all military installations. According to Reuters, their air defences managed to shoot down a third of the coalition missiles — a much better success rate than 2017 Shayrat missile strike, when almost all of 59 US Tomahawk missiles landed.  Maria Zakharova, the excitable spokesperson of Russia’s Foreign Ministry said that the West “claimed “moral leadership” but “had struck a blow to the capital of a sovereign state.” The coalition had, she said, had attacked “just at a time when Syria held the chance of a peaceful future.” Syria air strikes: US, UK and France joint military actionSyria air strikes: US, UK and France joint military actionDamascus skies erupt with missile fire as the US launches an attack on Syria targeting different parts of the capital.
