But so is every novelist. Both pursue dreams of another world, inside books or across borders – an affinity that has become central to the novel in our globalised era. If, in the 19th century with its nascent metropolises, the novelist’s preferred proxy was the flâneur loitering in arcades and observing urban fleshpots, today’s novelists, from Zadie Smith to Teju Cole, cannot resist identifying with the migrant, who sees the world through similarly fresh eyes.The Indian writer Aravind Adiga’s new novel is firmly in this tradition. Set in Australia, where Adiga himself spent a few years finishing up high school (he remains a citizen), Amnesty tells the story of Danny, a Sri Lankan who has become an “illegal alien” after dropping out of his “ripoff” college. He is surprisingly content cleaning apartments in suburban Sydney when one of his clients is murdered by another. Over the next 24 hours, Danny contends with the dilemma of whether to risk deportation by informing the police.His ambiguous status is of the moment, when so-called migrants are often really refugees and those we think of as refugees may simply be in search of a livelihood. Illegals might have arrived legally, while legitimate asylum seekers must enter illegally. Leaving behind his war-scarred, tsunami-ravaged Tamil homeland, Danny might himself be a refugee. But his asylum application was rejected, absurdly, because he had not been smuggled in. He came, instead, on a student visa, and overstays, for work and for love. Such are the complex motives and bureaucratic caprices that now characterise migration.Amnesty lays bare Australia’s hypocrisies and contradictions. Immigration props up the economy yet is subject to the most draconian restrictions in the west – a region the country claims membership of against all geographic evidence. Society is so leerily insular that crowds cheer on sea patrols as they arrest incoming refugees. But in spite or maybe because of laws hellbent on preserving homogeneity, people are “famished” for the “belligerently weird … like a Tamil man with gold highlights in his hair”. Despite all efforts to the contrary, Australia is a melting pot, its allure felt in the ostentatiously multicultural epithets (“Japanese-Brazilian”, “vegan Vietnamese”) that Danny relishes.Ever since his Booker-winning debut The White Tiger dovetailed the story of a homicidal businessman in India with a state visit by the Chinese premier, Adiga has often returned to his favourite motifs: enterprising desis (people from the Indian subcontinent), murder, the distorting effects of Chinese capital – all of which appear in Amnesty. The strength of his novels lies in their spirit of political inquiry, born of his years as Time’s Asia correspondent, uncovering hierarchies lost on the more typical literary novelist.For example, Adiga understands the neoimperial ide-and-conquer relied on by Australian immigration enforcement. “Easiest thing in the world, becoming invisible to white people,” he writes, “but the hardest thing is becoming invisible to brown people.” He knows that nationality has no more zealous s than naturalised immigrants, eager to set themselves apart from their paperless peers. The plot turns on the threat of being “dobbed in” by an Indian with a coveted Australian passport.Amnesty is a migrant’s-eye view of Australia, and Adiga conveys how migrants learn to read the signs of their strange new world and devise meaningful taxonomies for it. Suburban Sydney, for Danny, comprises two social classes: “thick bum” and “thin bum”, the obese poor who don’t hire cleaners and the salad-eating joggers who do. (This schema may sound familiar: in The White Tiger, the caste system was similarly bifurcated into “Men with Big Bellies, and Men with Small Bellies”.)Adiga unwisely burdens himself with a 24-hour structure, which is stymied by life’s inevitable mundanity. In Joyce’s Ulysses – progenitor of this form – or in recent works by others who have risen to the challenge, such as Amit Chaudhuri, the banal is burnished with an aesthetic charge. Amnesty strains for significance in its hourly accounting of Danny’s day, edging into the perfunctory or worse, the inane.Novelists like to court praise for their naked powers of invention, but Adiga cites his sources in the acknowledgments, perhaps mindful of previous criticisms that he, an elite, Oxford-educated south Indian, had misrepresented north India’s rustbelt poor. The life of an illegal migrant is even more perilous terrain, as we saw with Jeanine Cummins’s widely condemned novel American Dirt. Some critics now insist writers should “stay in their lane”. But I’d prefer an amnesty – something Danny dreams of – for any artist who crosses the borders of expectation. Even Adiga’s flawed creation reminds us of the pleasure and understanding that can ensue when writers migrate out of their own experience.• Amnesty by Aravind Adiga is published by Picador (RRP £16.99).

Thanks to the prime minister the dark clouds of uncertainty are now scudding away and a grateful nation feels free to start spending again.The “Boris bounce” theory rests on the highly questionable assumption that consumer behaviour is affected by political events rather than by other factors, such as whether they are better off than they were before and whether prices are going up or down.January is the time consumers traditionally seek out bargains in the sales and – after two dismal months for retailers – there were plenty of them on offer this year. People had more money in their pockets because earnings are rising faster than prices. Put the two together and there’s a plausible reason for the rebound in spending, albeit without such a grabby headline.Of course, there might be one or two iniduals who said to themselves: “I am glad the Conservatives won the election by such a thumping majority and I am now going out and celebrate by buying a new sofa.” Equally, though, there were plenty of voters who wanted to hide under the duvet when they heard the result.A more likely place for a Boris bounce to show up would be industry, since companies tend to be more sensitive to the political climate. There is ample evidence from the official figures of a mothballing of capital spending as a result of Brexit.But the latest snapshot of manufacturing from the CBI paints a relatively downbeat picture. Output fell in the three months to February at an only slightly slower pace than in the quarter ending in January, and while the employers’ organisation detected signs of a pick-up it made clear that the rebound was tentative and fragile.What’s true of manufacturing is true of the economy as a whole.

The stage where you can grab the “horse-faced lesbian” weapon and hurl it at an “arrogant” billionaire within the first minutes of the show starting.It’s the stage where a young midwestern mayor can trash the experience of a midwestern senator, who turns right back at him and says, “Are you trying to say I’m dumb or are you mocking me here?” So much for all that midwestern niceness.There’s a reason why the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday turned into such an epic Donnybrook. It’s called the primary calendar, which is inexorably counting down to the Super Tuesday contests in less than two weeks.At that point, one of the candidates on stage will emerge with a delegate lead that puts an end to all the quadrennial talk of a brokered convention. At this point, that candidate looks like Bernie Sanders.In the meantime, his five rivals on the debate stage have engaged in an entirely delusional sideshow of mutual annihilation.The odds will never be in their favor. They don’t have the time for all the cannon fire before they lose the Nevada caucus and then watch Sanders sweep the majority of California delegates.Instead they engaged in an entirely futile effort to knock each other out of the contest so they could confront the frontrunner alone. This is something that Mike Bloomberg’s advisers acknowledged is the only realistic prospect of stopping Sanders.Which prompted Amy Klobuchar to accuse Bloomberg of telling women like her to wait her turn and step aside. If Elizabeth Warren hadn’t already thrown the horse-faced line at Bloomberg, Klobuchar might have earned a few of the many gasps of shock and awe that rumbled through the audience.Until now, each new frontrunner in this long primary contest has faded under the fire of everyone else. At various points over the last year, Kamala Harris hemmed, Elizabeth Warren wilted and Pete Buttigieg bumbled.By the time it was Bernie Sanders’ turn in the barrel, it was his great good fortune that most of the fire was turned on everyone else.“Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist?” asked NBC’s Chuck Todd, crystallizing in one short question how ludicrous this primary contest has become. Faced with a metaphysical question about his own existence, the Democrats’ favorite billionaire admitted the obvious. “I’ve made a lot of money, and I’m giving it away,” he said, justifying his existence with his munificence.On stage alongside a hostile gang of millionaires, our beleaguered billionaire found his stride by defending the otherwise defenseless figure of the American economy. “We’re not going to throw out capitalism,” he said, sounding unscripted and unplugged for the first time. “We tried that. Other countries tried that. It was called communism and it doesn’t work.”For the first time during the debate, there were more gasps from the people on stage than from those in the audience.This topical argument about capitalism v communism led to an awesome series of counterpunches. Bernie said Mike was wealthier than the bottom 125 million Americans. Mike said Bernie was a socialist millionaire with three homes. Elizabeth talked about a wealth tax. Mike said he wanted to roll back the tax cuts of the Obama, um, Trump administration.One of the many pitfalls of political analysis is the temptation to treat the next election like the last one. But hindsight is not foresight, even when the names and faces look familiar.This Democratic primary is not the same as it was four years ago nor is it like the Republican contest of the same cycle. After three years of Trumpian dysfunction and disinformation, nothing is the same.Take Bernie Sanders. Four years ago he was the bitter insurgent, railing against the establishment and capitalism, while trashing the delegate count. Today he is the clear frontrunner, railing against the establishment and capitalism, while loving the delegate count.Wednesday’s debate was meant to be the biggest test for the former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose lavish spending has launched him late into the primary spotlight.But the expectations of Bloomberg were somewhere between subway and sewer levels. He was supposedly so ill-prepared for public gaze, and such a clunky gazillionaire, that his ability to communicate with the great unwashed was limited to him buying the services of professional meme-bots.Somehow Bloomberg was underwhelming at the same time as overperforming. He crossed the bar in the most boring way possible.In substance and style, this is Sanders’ contest. He has skewed the entire field towards his socialized healthcare proposal known as Medicare for All, so that the supposedly centrist candidates are calling for a Sanders-lite plan that Barack Obama never proposed – because he couldn’t pass it through a Senate where Democrats held a filibuster-proof 60 votes.But it is the tone of the debate that Bernie owns, not just the policy frame. Nobody can turn his fire on other candidates like the Vermont senator. When pushed hard on how he would pay for his new public healthcare system, Sanders accused his critics of being owned by healthcare CEOs. When pushed for his long-promised medical records, Sanders challenged his questioners to join him for pushups on the campaign trail.Sanders doesn’t just dodge questions he destroys the questioner. On those terms, the other angry candidates sounded like pale imitations of the angry old socialist.Joe Biden said he was best equipped to beat Donald Trump. Mike Bloomberg said he would spend his money to beat Donald Trump. Amy Klobuchar said she won in Minnesota so she would obviously beat Donald Trump. Only Bernie Sanders sounded like he would dismember Donald Trump.This would be fine if there weren’t a billion dollars of disinformation headed towards Sanders for his socialism and his medical records. If there weren’t endless examples of successful scare tactics against socialists, Sanders could sail on regardless.Instead we face an election between a Democratic nominee who was pro-Soviet Russia versus a Republican president who is pro-Putin Russia. What a time to be alive.“We shouldn’t have to choose between a candidate who wants to burn this party down and another who wants to buy this party out,” said Mayor Pete in one of the lines his developers hardcoded into his haircut.They shouldn’t. But they will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8188974657b487d7244764ee0148850586aa765/0_252_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad7a013a5425e10b223a874d51b7c3e4","title":"conservatives immigration plan ideology economics low wages","story":"The cause of low wages isn’t EU freedom of movement, but the erosion of employment rights and collective bargainingThe government’s new immigration plan, which aims to move away from relying on influxes of cheap labour by closing Britain’s borders to “non-skilled” workers, is based on a flawed understanding of how the economy works. It reveals the risks of privileging ideology over economics, the hallmark of Conservative governments since the 1970s.The government argues that by deliberately creating shortages of workers, wages will rise as firms compete for scarce labour. In turn, this will provide an incentive for firms to upskill their workers and to substitute more labour for capital, thus raising productivity.As was argued by the IPPR commission on economic justice – based on the experience of Scandinavian economies – if wages rise, productivity will follow. This is in stark contrast to traditional economic orthodoxy that productivity has to rise so that wages will follow. Higher wages would be good for workers and their families and for the economy as a whole. But the Tories plan is wrongheaded. Here’s why.The idea underpinning the government’s plan is that wages have been held down – they have only just barely returned to their pre-crisis March 2008 peak – because there are too many workers chasing too few jobs as a result of EU freedom of movement. But this completely ignores the realities of the modern labour market. The problem is not the intensity of competition between workers for jobs, but the excessive power of employers and the weak position of workers in Britain.In many places today, a few large firms dominate the local labour market. Large employers such as supermarkets, distribution centres and hospitality businesses are able to get away with paying the minimum wage, since there are few alternatives for workers. Changing the immigration rules will not shift this power imbalance as workers will still have little choice but to accept the pay offered by excessively powerful businesses.Moreover, after constant attacks on trade unions by successive Conservative governments, collective bargaining no longer has the power to effectively confront employers. This is further exacerbated by the deliberate erosion of employment rights, with greater numbers of workers on precarious zero-hours contracts and poor enforcement of what little rights exist. Again, immigration rules do nothing to solve these problems.The government also argues that firms will reach out to “economically inactive” Britons and pull them into new jobs, thereby increasing overall economic output. This ignores that Britain is at near-full employment. After 10 years of austerity and a cruel and callous benefits system, Priti Patel’s claim that there are around eight million workers that could enter the labour market is at best wishful thinking and at worst downright mendacious.But perhaps most strange of all is the absence of any discussion about demographic change: Britain is a rapidly ageing society, with ever-increasing demands for health and social care and greater pension liabilities. The dependency ratio – the number of workers to economically inactive people, mainly the elderly and children – is deteriorating. Britain needs immigrants not only to work in vital sectors such as social care, but to make the government’s finances sustainable.The Tories are responding to cultural anxiety about immigration with a promise of better pay for Britain’s workers. It’s a policy doomed to fail, based on ideology not insight. Britain is still suffering the consequences of the destructive economic decisions of the 1980s. How long will this mistake reverberate through the British economy? Only time will tell.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64baf8751f6d1a912ed40bded28879bc1d840c5e/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19de5f60762b84837b1169bcb04d27ab","title":"health centre coronavirus information help","story":"Everyone in my walk-in centre is getting a bit twitchy.

No one has died or even been admitted to intensive care, and those who have died elsewhere have often had multiple existing conditions.After the national guidelines are updated to include a range of new countries, I realise we had sent home a patient who fitted the criteria. I struggle with whether to ignore it or not, but decide I do not want to be responsible for an outbreak.The patient was only in our entrance lobby and one clinical room, but we decide to clean the waiting area and public toilet as well, and the health centre closes for part of the morning for decontamination. Public Health England wants to test the patient but it is too busy to organise it. It tells me to call a particular hospital which does not want to do it because the person does not live in its area, and after a couple of hours of trying to arrange a test, my incident team tells me I must get on with running my health centre, which has opened for business as usual.Although we are used to dealing with terrorist incidents, rogue viruses or bad weather – and are always periodically preparing for something – the health service is now functioning at or beyond maximum capacity all the time. Public health funding has suffered dramatic real-terms cuts and historically low investment. We do not have enough staff, budgets are tightly controlled, and capacity issues create bottlenecks throughout the massively stretched system.The patient’s test result is negative, but the relief is short-lived. On Sunday 9 February we have another patient in our isolation room who also needs to be tested. Then 111 decides to transfer the patient to hospital by ambulance, the safest way to mitigate the risk of spreading anything. We wait all night for the ambulance to show up. I have no blankets or food to offer as we are a day unit and have never had to do this before.My patient is not a priority for the ambulance service as theirs is not an immediately life-threatening problem, and the dispatcher must consider it will take 90 minutes to deep-clean the ambulance after transporting my patient.I don’t get home until a colleague comes in at 7am on Monday. I had been at work for 19 hours, for the first time in my 20-year career. Nobody should be working for that amount of time, but it wasn’t anticipated that my patient – who subsequently tested negative – would have to wait 15 hours for an ambulance.At the end of last week our personal protective equipment training was cancelled due to a shortage of kits to carry out the testing. Other preparations continue and we are buying new supplies, yet most of the world’s face masks are produced in China and Taiwan and they are being reserved for their own residents.Staff are soon being sent home if they have inadvertent unprotected contact with a patient who needs testing – three people so far. They are ordered to remain at home until the patient’s test result is confirmed. This is an extreme precaution as it is highly unlikely anyone could pass the virus on in the 48 hours or so it takes until we get a result. In a worst-case scenario this policy could lead to the closure of services due to staff shortages. We contact Public Health England for advice, but it is utterly swamped and can’t give us an immediate response. We haven’t tested any staff, and would do so only if we have a positive test in a patient.People need to know that the best way to access help is from home if they are not seriously unwell. Not enough is being done to get this message across.There are systemic issues which mean the system could collapse if the national guidelines do not keep up with the evolving situation. If three or four patients who need testing come into my walk-in centre, which is in an urban area, I do not have the space to isolate them. I’ll have to wait for ambulances and half my consultation rooms will be taken out. This is before you even start taking into account the impact on hospitals.Also, we do not have the authority to send samples off to a lab, they must go through the local hospital – that’s why people are being referred to hospital from primary care even though it is easy to take samples. By Tuesday 18 February however, I am told of sensible plans to train community swabbing teams to visit people at home and in walk-in centres.This is so important because although people should stay on the sofa with a blanket watching TV if they are not acutely unwell, they will always rush to the nearest point of care during an outbreak like coronavirus unless there is home testing and a public health information campaign.• An anonymous lead clinician at an urban walk-in health centre in the south of England was talking to Mattha Busby"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08cfad4b9fec68d23eae4184bf4a13ad5ed25a4d/0_137_4917_2950/master/4917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50ea05618c30dc137ab81c21e122b42f","title":"labour electability principles power elected austerity","story":"It may feel as if the Labour leadership contest is never-ending, but with three candidates now on the ballot, buckle your seatbelts for the final stretch. Judging how “electable” each candidate is will surely be high on every Labour party member’s list, as the movement contemplates five more years of Tory rule.Back in 2015, there was a lack of curiosity from much of the media about Jeremy Corbyn’s success it was easier to cry “cult” than investigate why an objectively average candidate could inspire such passion and devotion. Corbyn’s election as leader largely came from two points: his willingness to stand up for the party’s principles, and the intellectual deficit shown by his opponents as they failed to offer any solutions to the problems of the post-financial crash era. In a party that had triangulated itself beyond recognition by voting for a welfare bill that would push disabled and working-class people into destitution, a leader willing to stand up for Labour’s traditional values of compassion and solidarity was a lightning bolt for the members.And yet we now face a fresh task. While Corbyn’s victory came after just five years in opposition, by the next general election, Labour will have been out of office for 14 years. The path to power is also steeper: the party now needs to recover from its worst result since the 1930s. There’s no avoiding that, nor is it inspiring to attempt to. Genuine hope does not emerge from empty words or denial, but comes from acknowledging reality and collectively building a plan to fight back.Rebecca Long-Bailey – who alarmed many with her perfect score of Corbyn after his landslide defeat – has notably honed her message, giving a keynote speech last week on how to win power, while urging members not to give up on an ambitious policy agenda. Lisa Nandy has been particularly vocal on the scale of the party’s task. Keir Starmer, pitched by his team as the “unity” candidate, has been focused on proving his leftwing credentials. It’s the difficult position candidates in a leadership contest following a mass defeat find themselves in: they must simultaneously show loyalty to their predecessor in order to court members, while displaying an awareness of inescapable truths about Labour’s failings.Electability is said to be a dirty word for parts of the left. This is largely nonsense: in an era of Conservative-driven poverty, broken public services and threats to workers rights, few groups are more desperate to gain power. But electability has become a somewhat loaded term. On the one hand, it has become a description for candidates who are willing to conform to the status quo, while those pushing for societal change are dubbed “unelectable”. To see this in practice, look to the US. where Joe Biden has been cast as the “safe option” while an altogether stronger candidate, Bernie Sanders, is said to be the risk. On the other hand, candidates who profess concern for electability are accused of “selling out”: they’re painted as the suit-wearing yes-man who will pivot from their ethics if it seems electorally pragmatic.This fear is understandable. Labour has the chipped immigration mugs to remind us. But neither interpretation is quite fair. Indeed, the framing of the YouGov question betrays part of the problem: when we talk of electability, we are working from the assumption that taking office inevitably means a choice between principles and power.In reality, electability is considerably more complex. Research suggests our interpretation of electability is typically a mix of media influence, self-fulfilling polls and psychological biases based on gender and race. That’s not to say certain politicians aren’t more likely to be popular with voters, or that we can’t make personal judgments when picking the leader of the Labour party. We can look at a candidate’s baggage or personality and calculate if it will be advantageous or insurmountable. We can learn from the voting trends in recent years and infer what characteristics will appeal to former Labour voters We can look at what’s happening in other democracies across the world. But it’s not a science, and it’s ever-fluctuating. As one researcher in the US put it: “We don’t know who is electable until someone is elected.”Only in questioning the notion of electability can the Labour party come close to being elected. This will not mean watering down policies but offering effective leadership and a coherent message that resonates with lost voters. Above all, it means putting aside assumptions and being open about what to do next.The tightrope is not an easy one to tread. To simultaneously listen and to lead. To doggedly defend principles while showing humility and taking constructive criticism about what hasn’t worked. To inspire the committed while prioritising the unconverted. But it’s a tightrope any Labour leader hoping to win over both the membership and the electorate will have to master. To be electable twice-over is the real challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d20dc7a5582fedf088db5f384a9110b469d4f9c/0_0_7072_4720/master/7072.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e50596cc799ff34a13159fd2b68c88f","title":"why owning fewer clothes makes you a better dresser","story":"There is a sartorial magic to the kind of streamlined wardrobe made famous by Audrey Hepburn and Sade. Here’s how to master itThe capsule wardrobe has always been cool. The capsule wardrobe is Françoise Hardy and Sade. It is Audrey Hepburn and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. It is all the heady intoxication of fashion with no hangover of buyer’s remorse. It is a magic pill to streamline your wardrobe, so no more tying yourself in knots figuring out what to wear.OK, so here’s the thing: as we all agree a capsule wardrobe is such a great idea, why don’t we actually dress like this? I’ve never nailed it and I know a lot of very fabulous, cool, clever women and most of them haven’t either. But 2020 might just be the year that is going to change. Because capsule dressing is no longer the sensible option, the one you know you should commit to, if only you didn’t keep getting your head turned by newer, more daring, more exciting, more instantly desirable clothes. In 2020, capsule dressing is where the newest, most daring, most exciting, most instantly desirable fashion is happening.Sustainability is aspirational. Zoolanderish, yes, but also true. If sustainability means that we as a species get to continue living on this planet, then that seems to me to pretty much sum up our wishlist right now. A fabulous capsule wardrobe is the sustainable way – which is to say the modern way – to raise your fashion game. You can tell that sustainability has become glamorous because outfit repeating – which used to be something that normal people did all the time but fancy people wouldn’t be seen dead doing, sort of like getting the bus – has now become a badge of honour. Meghan Markle rewears dresses, Joaquin Phoenix sticks with one Stella McCartney tux through red carpet season.The tagline of Wardrobe NYC, the front row’s current favourite label, is “luxury without excess”. Founded by designer Josh Goot and fashion director Christine Centenera, Wardrobe NYC is “the ultimate wardrobe for those with shared values and aesthetic”, which translates as pared-down urban minimalism designed in New York and made in Italy. The aesthetic is radically minimalist, but the price tag is seriously upscale, with £1,500 buying you a four-piece wardrobe, delivered as a set of blazer, shirt, T-shirt and leggings – just choose from black or white, and click your size. (It’s like a HelloFresh box, but with everything you need to look cool rather than to make dinner.) A four-piece, pared-back, day-to-night wardrobe commanding a price point usually ruled by the fancy party dress speaks volumes about the status of the capsule wardrobe right now.With sustainability non-negotiable, we who love fashion are finding ways to tease our passion apart from overconsumption. As the world heats, capsule dressing looks cooler than ever. A streamlined wardrobe frees a little more of your time, your sanity – and the world’s resources. “A capsule wardrobe isn’t just quicker,” Hornby says. “It’s better.”  This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The first is the cynical tabloid editor’s perspective, picked up from decades of watching famous faces prostitute themselves in the name of publicity: the idea here is that those who place themselves in the public eye, who want the attention that comes with fame, are not really entitled to compassion.The second view, with which it is hard not to sympathise when reading about Ben Affleck’s struggles with alcoholism and his time as Batman in the New York Times, is that no matter how rich and privileged a well-known figure might be, they are flawed human beings like the rest of us who are worthy of our empathy when they find themselves in dark places. Affleck was a terrible Batman, entirely the wrong choice to play Bruce Wayne in Warner Bros’ ill-conceived extended universe of DC comic book movies, but it remains sad to witness how the actor’s struggles with the role fed into his private life.We should not forget that this was always something of a poisoned chalice. Affleck’s Batman was hard to like from the beginning: a knuckle-headed bruiser who tried to kill Superman – basically the Jesus of the DC universe – because he blamed him for the destruction of polis caused by General Zod in DC’s first entry, 2013’s Man of Steel. Warner Brothers needed this setup, because it allowed them to title the next episode Batman vs Superman, and Affleck ended up being the patsy. That 2016 movie’s subtitle, Dawn of Justice, was always something of a shonky afterthought that essentially gave away the movie’s ending before we had seen the film’s opening frame. Like Zack Snyder’s movie itself, the whole thing smacked of a film-making machine where the marketing men held sway over everything. In the wake of the film’s subsequent derisive reviews, it soon became clear that the movie’s star was deeply unhappy with life behind the cowl and we saw all those “Sad Affleck” memes.It got even worse by the time of 2016’s Justice League, by which time Batman had been hamfistedly reconfigured as a heroic figure, with Affleck forced into an apologetic performance that seemed to mirror his real-life struggles. It seems that he has been apologising ever since, reasonably so in some cases.Affleck isn’t the first denizen of Gotham City to suffer for his art. Heath Ledger won a posthumous best supporting actor Oscar in February 2009 for his startling, spiky turn as The Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, having died from an overdose of prescription drugs just over a year earlier. At the time the newspapers were filled with reports that the Australian actor had been taking prescription drugs to help himself sleep when he accidentally overdosed in his Manhattan apartment – Ledger had admitted in a New York Times interview that he had been struggling to switch off after taking on the role of Gotham’s clown prince of crime, as well as a part in another film, the Bob Dylan biopic I’m Not There. “Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night,” he told the newspaper. “I couldn’t stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going.”Is there something particularly dark and intense about the world of Batman that feeds into a kind of existential malaise for actors who find themselves trying to embody its main players on screen? This is a reasonable argument to pursue in the case of Ledger, whose Joker was a poisonous whirlwind of vicious, sadistic nihilism – a venus flytrap for the dedicated method actor. But Affleck’s caped crusader, certainly by the time of his final turn in Justice League, seemed to have morphed into more of a cynical, wisecracking type than the tortured soul of Christian Bale-era Batman. It ought to have been something of a fun role to play, with stand-in director and screenwriter Joss Whedon throwing in trademark japes from the sidelines, yet it never seems to have been enjoyable.Affleck never really got the chance to pursue his own vision for the character, having ultimately opted out of directing and starring in the forthcoming The Batman in the interests of his own mental health. This week we got to see how the new man behind the mask, Robert Pattinson, is likely to look in Matt Reeves’ film. This is a fledgling, punky Batman, one who might be just starting out on his battles to save Gotham City and who looks all the more intriguing for it. It’s hard not to think that Affleck might be best off away from the role, and the film series better off in a place where it can make a fresh start.The peculiar thing about Batman is that Bruce Wayne has every gift given to him by life, yet prefers to suffer behind a mask than live out a life of luxury and indolence. Perhaps Affleck, and others who have struggled for their art in the name of Gotham City, would understand that essential paradox."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a320ee0fc8497d54222554bd7a85f69dc25f6cc/781_161_3332_1999/master/3332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=625887474ec11147cfc3e0c7d8509f50","title":"end of the century review lucio castro barcelona","story":"Two men who meet in Barcelona have an unsettling feeling of deja vu in this elegant romantic dramaEnd of the Century, from first-time director Lucio Castro, is a post-coital reverie of a movie, a musingly light meditation on sex, love, monogamy and freedom, pondering the empty fridge of singledom and the full fridge of marriage. It balances what is with what might have been and what could still be, and, although the result is maybe a bit less substantial than Castro intended, there is a certain literary elegance in the way he sketches it out.Juan Barberini plays Ocho, an Argentinian man in Barcelona on holiday on his own. After checking into his Airbnb, he wanders around town, goes down to the beach and notices an attractive man, Javi (Ramon Pujol). Later, while looking out from his balcony in the evening, he notices this same man strolling on the pavement below and impulsively calls out to him to come and have a drink. They hook up, and Ocho finds he has a real connection with Javi. They talk about past and current relationships (Javi is in an open marriage) and Ocho has an eerie feeling … wait … have they in fact met before, 20 years ago, at the end of the century?The resulting flashbacks are a little disconcerting, because the two men do not look any different (though Irishman-style youthification wouldn’t work) and do not behave all that differently. Another film-maker might have tried changing the hairstylesand and beards to denote the pastness of the past – although it is arguable that what we are seeing is Javi and Ocho doing the remembering, and we all tend to believe that we have always looked (and been) the same. Yet is it really plausible that Ocho could forget something like this? Maybe.Memory is treacherous.

The problem, I think, comes from a fear of upsetting its target audience of older kids (the film has a 12A rating). So the tough bits are fuzzily done – at arm’s length and hurried over – making for an oddly flat unemotional watch. The accents don’t help: the actors all speaking English dialogue with ’Allo-’Allo accents (with Jean Reno thrown in for a bit of Gallic authenticity).The setting is occupied France. In the Pyrenees, teenager Jo (Stranger Things’ Noah Schnapp) discovers that mean old lady Widow Horcada (Anjelica Huston) is in fact heroically hiding Jewish children on her pig farm. Huston does her best with a thin character, but even she struggles with the starchy dialogue: “Some people collect coins or stamps. We collect enemies of the Reich.” Widow Horcada is also harbouring a Jewish man, Benjamin (Frederick Schmidt), who has become separated from his young daughter, Anya. Reno plays Jo’s grandfather, a salty first world war veteran who marches around the village wearing his army medals in proud defiance of the occupying force.The film is gorgeous to look at, all alpine meadow flowers and glorious green mountains. But the drama loses momentum pretty early on. When the Nazis grow suspicious of Widow Horcada, her resistance gang must decide: should they risk one last journey over the mountains? Schnapp, with his lovely innocent open face, carries it all so far. But the film pulls its punches, awkwardly rushing through difficult scenes, such as the one involving a sneering sadistic German officer performing a mock execution on a teenage boy with learning difficulties. Kids may feel they’re owed more honesty.

Personally, I always have food in my pockets – fine when it’s rice cakes, less so when it’s cheeseThat is what I have always done – what I like. There is some method behind it: I suspect rigid three-meal-a-day people of secretly enjoying the thrill of being hungry. There is something performative in their self-denial. I don’t know why this annoys me as much as it does, but it has resulted in me eating a lot of pork scratchings. Fasting, which is popular at the moment, suggests leaving a gap of some kind between one food adventure and the next, but I am not sure that eschewing food for as few as four or six hours counts as a fast.Nibbling worked fine for me as a sole trader, but then I produced young, who also did what I liked, which meant: “Eat whenever you are hungry, whatever time it is.” This has been going on for 12 years. Its upsides are straightforward: whenever you are hungry, you eat. But are there any downsides?There is a critical problem with variety. Cooking dinner is an undertaking, if only a 20-minute one. Even if we make the same things repeatedly, everyone does some basic cabin checks (in this analogy, the cabin is your stomach): did I have sausages last night? When did I last have a green vegetable? Is there more to life than pasta? It would defeat the object of a snack if you thought about it for even 20 seconds, so you always end up having the same thing. It is almost never an apple. It tends to be made of carbs, as they are the most portable. Let’s just admit it: it is always crisps. The furthest concession to health I will make is a sour cream and chive lentil twist – and that is a vanishingly rare event. It is so often a Pringle that I think I am Martha Stewart when I remember to buy Popchips. I have created such a strong crisp norm that anything not-crisps is considered a health food, even when it is a hash brown.Sweets fit uncomfortably into the snack arc, since they are obviously a treat, yet at the same time they are the size of a snack. So I have moulded what should be a big-ticket sugar item into yet another miniature in the minibar of snack life.People who snack never finish a full meal, which is annoying when you have cooked that meal, but not as bad as the ascent into adulthood, when you still snack constantly, but discover you can also manage a full meal. The only food you can eat constantly without ill effect is hay – and even then only if you are a rabbit.My pockets are always full of random food, which is fine when it is a rice cake, but not when it is cheese. A huge amount of plastic goes into the process of separating foods into snack sizes, which then ends up in my pocket as well. I walk around making a crinkling noise, as if I am wearing a cheap clown costume.Just as you would never put your whole mind to choosing a snack, so no one ever concentrates on eating one. This lowers the ceiling of eating pleasure – although I wonder how high that ceiling is in the first place when you are talking about a Pringle – and means that you eat too fast. There was a huge movement in the early 00s around chewing every mouthful 32 times (when I say “huge movement”, I mean “two articles”) this has ancient digestive benefits, its proponents said, breaking down the food so thoroughly at the start of its journey that the rest of your tract didn’t have to work so hard. It didn’t catch on, because it was boring and a bit bovine, but the space between 32 times and “inhaling your food while doing something else” is probably the one we should inhabit.There are times when we go paleo, but without the raw meat – technically, this makes it a pre-paleo diet – and live on nuts and berries, with the odd edamame bean. This feels great for the 15 minutes that it lasts. Overall, snacking is the most disruptive domestic issue I have encountered – and I am orced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8c02d3b52b7567dc80d87f01e94cf60793cf6f3/0_66_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a8298a3712bfae9da59828b2d174a2","title":"messi barcelona not in shape to win champions league but i want to stay eric abidal","story":"Lionel Messi says he has no intention of leaving Barcelona but has warned that they need to act after a month in which there has been “one problem after another”, and admitted that right now they are not good enough to win the Champions League.The Argentinian also said that he felt “attacked” by the technical director, Eric Abidal, and described allegations that the club had employed an agency to create online accounts to defend the president Josep Maria Bartomeu and criticise players as “strange”. Messi said he would “wait to see if they were true”. Bartomeu has described the accusations as “completely false”.There are significant doubts about their capacity to do that – as Messi expressed in a wide-ranging interview with El Mundo Deportivo. On Thursday Barcelona completed the signing of the striker Martin Braithwaite from Leganés for €18m (£15.1m), after receiving permission from La Liga to register a player outside the transfer window.“People are nervous,” Messi said, “but that’s normal because of everything we have experienced recently and because the team isn’t playing well either. The league is very up and down, we’re inconsistent and Madrid are too a lot of points are being dropped, and I think we will be there. Then, it’s true that in the Champions League we have to keep growing, and a lot too, because the way we are right now I don’t think it’s enough to win the Champions League.Messi also explained his decision to publicly call out Abidal on social media at the start of February, accusing him of tarnishing the players’ reputation when he laid the blame for the sacking of Ernesto Valverde at the dressing room door and suggested that they do not work hard.In the latest damaging episode, on Monday Cadena Ser Radio reported that Barcelona had paid €1m to hire a company called I3 Ventures which set up online media accounts to write stories defending the president and damage the image of some players and former players. Barcelona denied the accusation, saying that they had hired I3 to “monitor” social media, but not to attack anyone.

Those who work with Bellingham highlight his bite, work ethic and notably the physical strides he has made over the past months – his manager, Pep Clotet, revealed Bellingham had grown 2.4cm since the start of the season – and there is a sense he will end up as a No 8, though he has thrived on both flanks. From a very young age his intelligence and competitive streak stood out to academy staff and, towards the end of last season, Bellingham was slowly exposed to the first-team environment before being named in Clotet’s squad for a pre-season camp in Portugal.“We put a plan in place where we were integrating him into first-team training on an ad-hoc basis, then a regular basis, then we had him part of the matchday squad as an observer, and then part of the matchday squad taking part in the warmup,” says Kristjaan Speakman, Birmingham’s academy manager, who also oversaw the progress of alumni Demarai Gray, Nathan Redmond and Jack Butland. “We were well aware that at some point in the first half of this season, the player would make his debut in the first team. Whenever that happens there are inevitably a lot of eyes and a lot of pressure but we wanted to make that as seamless and as comfortable as possible.”Birmingham continue to carefully manage the midfielder’s ascent, having tried to strike a balance between challenging the player and allowing him to flourish at youth level, but the Stourbridge-born Bellingham has kept his boyhood club on their toes since joining their pre-academy aged seven, after being identified by Simon Jones, the academy’s head of recruitment. At 14, Bellingham played for the under-18s and, as a 15-year-old in October 2018, he got the winner on his under-23s debut at Nottingham Forest. In September he scored on his first league start at Charlton, a fortnight after scoring the winner off the bench at St Andrew’s.“It’s OK having a plan, but high-level, elite players do not always stick to the plan because they gain momentum and need support at different points,” says Speakman. “If you had said to me before: ‘Will he score on his debut?’ I’d have said: ‘Yes, probably,’ because that’s the sort of thing he does. When you have the unique opportunity to follow a player like Jude’s journey through, it is an incredible thing for all of our staff that they have been able to see this boy grow and develop from a cheeky nine-year-old through to being a first-team player. There is nothing that beats that excitement, optimism and nervousness around a player making his debut for the first team.”The Birmingham goalkeeper David Stockdale, on loan at Wycombe, has witnessed Bellingham’s progress first hand after being relegated to train with the under-18s last season, while the midfielder was sitting his GCSEs at Priory School in Edgbaston. Stockdale occasionally gave Bellingham a lift to training from the family home near Bromsgrove. “He sent me a picture of his results, so that was a nice moment for me,” says Stockdale. “He did really well – he’s a smart kid. At that time he was coming into training and then going back to school in his uniform, so you can imagine the kind of pressure.“There are not a lot of people who could handle that. It just shows you what his mindset is like. He takes things on board he tries to take in all the information anyone can give him. His mind works like a 25-year-old he is very mature for his age, very approachable, polite, just a lovely fella who has all the makeup to go to the top. When we used to sit next to each other on the coach, I’d say: ‘I couldn’t hardly kick the ball over the halfway line at 16!’”The midfielder’s tenacity has fuelled comparisons to Dele Alli, who cut his teeth in the Football League with MK Dons, and Bellingham is on the radar of Europe’s powerhouses, including Ajax, Barcelona and Manchester United. “People are giving him the handle of ‘superstar’ but to him, it’s water off a duck’s back,” says Stockdale. “He plays with the freedom of a kid and long may it continue.”Bellingham’s father, Mark, a sergeant for West Midlands police, was a prolific non-league striker, and his younger brother, Jobe, is an under-14 in Birmingham’s academy who plays slightly further forward and also up an age group for England. “They are wonderful kids, because of the home that they come from and that is all credit to his mum and dad, who are great people,” Stockdale says. “They are just a happy-go-lucky family and nothing fazes them. Hopefully one day we’ll see another brother partnership in England.”Bellingham’s development is testament to the work of academy staff past and present – from Speakman to Mike Dodds, the influential lead youth development coach, the under-18s manager, Steve Spooner, and Paul Robinson, the former Birmingham defender who worked with Bellingham in the under-23s last season – but, above all, to the player and his family. On Tuesday Bellingham, one of six academy players to make their first-team debuts this season, stayed behind after training to watch Birmingham’s under-18s beat Bolton. “We, ultimately, want to produce footballers, but we definitely want to produce good people,” says Speakman."},{"url":null,"title":"dreams review creative learning as delightful play","story":"PS4 Media MoleculeSony Computer EntertainmentThis compulsive genre-crossing title combines animation studio with design toolkit and social network as it teaches game creationEveryone who plays Media Molecule’s Dreams will come away with their own story of when, exactly, it clicked for them. Part game design toolkit, part digital audio workstation, part animation studio and part social network, there’s something here for every niche, every creative ambition. For me, it was “animating” a balloon in the background of a 3D platformer stage. I popped down a camera gadget from an attractive, simple menu, grabbed the balloon with the cursor, and recorded a less-than-elegant motion loop by wagging the Dualshock’s gyro about.This realisation that I could direct traps and traversal, cutscenes and contraptions, by acting out what I wanted to happen on screen was my first inkling that Dreams might live up to its promise: to erode the intimidating, seemingly insurmountable barriers between creator and audience to provide tools intuitive enough to facilitate, rather than complicate, creativity in its most earnest and experimental forms. We’re only talking about a balloon, but it felt like the finishing brush strokes on The Starry Night. Give me a pencil, and I’ll have trouble drawing you a balloon you could recognise. Within an hour of play, Dreams was letting me animate one.As delightful as Dreams is as a toolkit, what is perhaps just as important is how it teaches, and Dreams is everything a good teacher should be: generous, forgiving, thorough. Most of all, Dreams is encouraging. Hours of practical and video tutorials, along with achievements for progress, compulsively frame learning as structured play.Encouraging, too, are the social aspects. You don’t just share levels or art pieces, but the inidual elements that make up those creations. If you’re great at music but find animation difficult, for example, you can upload your own music packs for others to benefit from, and search the “dreamiverse” for another’s animations to complement your own work. Alongside this, there are templates for genres such as first-person shooters and platformers that provide a basic framework for addition and repetition.As well as creation and play mode – dream shaping and dream surfing respectively – Dreams comes packaged with a two- to three-hour story mode called Art’s Dream that tells of a forlorn double bass player in the days after a split from his band. It’s a melancholy, occasionally goofy and ultimately hopeful tribute to art and creation for its own sake. It’s also somewhat of a mission statement for Dreams, urging players to ignore self-doubt and let their creativity bloom.Gameplay wise, it’s a mashup of genre and visual styles, acting as a showcase for the platform. It does seem a bizarre choice on Media Molecule’s part, then, not to allow players to remix this flagship story mode. When you create your own “dreams” and upload them for others to use, you can toggle the option to allow remixes, which gives players access to the framework and guts of your creation. This allows them to tweak your work and re-upload it, but it also provides an invaluable learning tool for those looking to discover how the more complicated elements are achieved. It seems like a missed opportunity, and perhaps a direct contradiction to Dreams’ core philosophy, to not allow players to dissect and learn from the creation marketed as a high point of the possibilities the platform offers. Towards the end of Art’s Dream, the titutar Art encounters an old friend working the booth at a cinema. As happens a few times over the course of the story, the pair get into a thinly veiled but still lovely and inspiring conversation about the philosophy of creativity, culminating in the cinema worker telling Art: “Nothing is a waste of time if you love doing it.”It’s a great attitude. It’s also a convenient one if you happen to be selling a locked platform. If you make something in Dreams, it stays in Dreams. Media Molecule has spoken about implementing ways for players to monetise their creations, but currently only Sony and the developers can profit. Every creation, for now, increases the value of a commercial product from which creators have no way to benefit. How you feel about this will be the deciding factor on whether the game is for you. Elsewhere, PlayStation VR and online multiplayer support are also promised but have not yet been implemented.Dreams nonetheless still offers a set of powerful, enjoyable tools at a low price and hours of fantastic tutorials. Adults may find the presentation a little too charmed by its own whimsy, especially in light of the tension between an art for art’s sake message and a commercial walled garden. Yet it’s likely to encourage many younger players to bring their own dreams to life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5d821efce9bd7868bfc4f3d01a97b305cb20bcc/137_148_4063_2438/master/4063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e32e72c880bbd8c7629f149489719956","title":"love and free food mel brooks and carl reiner share the secrets of their 70 year friendship","story":"The giants of American comedy tell Hadley Freeman about the hits they have had, the wives they miss – and why they still spend every evening togetherEvery evening, Mel Brooks leaves his home in Santa Monica, gets in his car and stares down Los Angeles’ notorious rush-hour traffic to go to Carl Reiner’s house in Beverly Hills. There, the two comedy icons do what they like to do most these days: chat, eat dinner together and watch the long-running quiz show Jeopardy!“This is a great place because I got friendship, love and free food. Free eats are very important, you know,” says Brooks, as we wait for Reiner in his den. His voice is a little raspier than it once was, but that signature puckishness is fully intact.Brooks knows this home well because Reiner, 97, has lived in it for 60 years. Gene Kelly used to be his neighbour Kirk Douglas, 103, until last month, lived close by. Brooks – a mere whippersnapper of 93 – remembers when Reiner moved in because their friendship predates the house: they have been best friends for 70 years.“Robbie used to sit on the stairs, looking through the banisters, watching us do the 2000 Year Old Man. I’d say, ‘You should be sleeping!’ but he’d just sit there,” says Brooks. (Robbie is better known to those outside the inner Reiner circle as the film director Rob Reiner, Carl’s oldest child and still a baby at 72.)The 2000 Year Old Man is the revered comedy sketch Reiner and Brooks coined in the 1950s, in which Reiner – always playing the straight man – would interview Brooks, the titular old man, about his life. Despite coming from the same time and place as Jesus Christ, the 2000 Year Old Man talked an awful lot like a Jewish guy from 1950s Brooklyn: “I have over 42,000 children and not one of them ever visit me!” was a typical kvetch from Brooks. When Reiner asked what the plague was like, Brooks improvised back, “Too many rats, not enough cats.” Reiner and Brooks made five 2000 Year Old Man albums, winning a Grammy in 1998, and Brooks used to joke, when his films occasionally tanked, that he was living off his and Reiner’s comedy records.But the two friends started the routine as a private joke, something to amuse one another while they were sitting in this living room, and they still do it there today, to make one another laugh.Given that Brooks made Blazing Saddles, The Producers and Young Frankenstein, and Reiner directed The Jerk, Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid and The Man With Two Brains, while little Robbie Reiner on the staircase grew up to make This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally, it’s pretty easy to argue that much of the best mid to late 20th-century American comedy emerged from the people currently and formerly in this house.Reiner now appears, notably frailer than Brooks, and walks in slowly with some assistance. “What’s happening here?” he asks uncertainly.“It’s the ! Rupert doesn’t own it, so they can write what they like,” says Brooks.“Oh good, I’m happy. But come close because I sometimes have problems hearing,” says Reiner as he settles into an armchair. Brooks and I huddle in on either side of him.“Now tell her how you met me,” says Brooks, making the kind of loving prompt a wife would give her ailing husband, urging him to tell the anecdotes he has told a thousand times, and hoping he’ll tell them a thousand more.“I remember it very well. It was 1950 …” begins Reiner. Some of his faculties may be fading, but his love of storytelling is undimmed.Brooks and Reiner were both born in New York, second-generation Jewish immigrants. America was made by immigrants, but it was these children of immigrants who helped to define Jewish-American comedy, with its mix of joyful silliness and whaddya-gonna-do shrugs.“My dad invented clocks that run on batteries and he thought: ‘I’m gonna make a fortune!’” says Reiner, pointing to a battery-operated clock on a side table, barely visible among the dozens of century-ning family photos. “But then the war started, the Germans took the patent and they flooded the market.”“So really, we lost the war,” says Brooks with (of course) perfect comic timing.Why do they think so many comedians were – and are –Jewish? “Well, back when we started there weren’t that many jobs for Jews. It was either the garment centre, sports or comedy,” says Brooks.“I think Jews were naturally funny because they were low on the totem pole, so they made fun of the people higher on the pole,” says Reiner.“Oh yeah, that’s good. Carl’s very quick. He’s going to be 98 in March and he’s quicker than anybody,” says Brooks.They met working on Sid Caesar’s TV variety show, Your Show of Shows. (Other writers who worked for Caesar included Neil Simon and, later, Woody Allen, both of whom also played no small part in the coining of Jewish-American comedy.)“I’ll never forget it. I came in one day and I heard this guy say: ‘I’m a Jewish pirate. You know what they’re charging for sails these days? $33.72 a yard! I can’t afford to rape and pillage any more!’ I thought, who is this guy?” says Reiner, eyes widening at the memory. “This guy is the funniest single human being on the planet.”“Oh, come on,” scoffs Brooks. “Maybe the third.”“Just look at the raft of movies he’s made, from Blazing Saddles onward!” continues Reiner.“Well, The Jerk ain’t so bad,” says Brooks, with a fond pat of his friend’s wrist.The two “got a kick out of one another right away”, Brooks says. “Also, our wives liked each other, which was lucky because we love one another.”“The best thing Mel ever did was marry a girl named Anne Bancroft,” says Reiner.“Yeah, I did,” says Brooks, with a happy smile but sad eyes.“From the first time he saw her, every place she went, he made sure he was there,” chuckles Reiner.“Yeah, I did,” Brooks repeats a little more quietly.Brooks’ first marriage had just ended when he happened to stop by a studio to watch the taping of a Perry Como TV special. It was 5 February 1961. Bancroft was rehearsing and it was love at first sight for Brooks. Unable to control himself, he shouted out, “Anne Bancroft, I love you!”“Who are you?” she replied, peering out into the dark.“I’m Mel Brooks!” he shouted back.“I got your record!” she replied.So it was the 2000 Year Old man that got him a date with Anne Bancroft? “Yeah, pretty much. We started hanging out every day and every night – we couldn’t be without each other. We were made for each other,” Brooks says.Bancroft died from cancer in 2005. It has been hard for Brooks, learning to live without her. There was a period, after a hernia operation, when he stopped going out. “I was stuck at home – emotionally, I mean. I was afraid to go out. But then I pushed forward because that’s what you have to do, and I went out,” he says. Naturally, one of the first places he went was Reiner’s house: “Eating with this guy? You can’t beat it.”Reiner’s home is smart but in no way showy, the way some Beverly Hills homes are. Instead of gilt and marble, the main decorating accents are family photos: every surface is covered with pictures of the Reiners, and the most prominently featured is Reiner’s late wife, Estelle.“That painting there? She did that. My wife was a very fine artist,” says Reiner, pointing to a strikingly beautiful painting on the wall.“And she was a terrific jazz singer. She taught Anne how to play the ukulele,” says Brooks.“Then Anne put her in her movie Fatso. It started a career for her,” says Reiner. She later made appearances in The Man With Two Brains (directed by her husband) and To Be Or Not to Be (directed by Brooks.) But Estelle Reiner’s film career peaked in 1989, thanks not to her friends or husband, but to her son. Rob Reiner cast her in When Harry Met Sally to say the immortal line, “I’ll have what she’s having.”“Yes, she was special,” agrees Reiner. Estelle died in 2008. The two had been married for 64 years.Despite eating in most nights, Brooks and Reiner maintain a social life busier than most people a third of their age: my date with them had to be changed once when they realised they had double booked me with Nathan Lane, and tonight I am being squeezed in just after a visit from Alan Alda. But when you’re in your 90s, your friendship group depletes suddenly. Just weeks before our meeting, the screenwriter Buck Henry died at the age of 89. As well as creating with Brooks the 1960s satirical detective TV show, Get Smart, he wrote The Graduate, which, of course, starred Bancroft.This sets Brooks to thinking about other friends who have passed away: Gene Wilder, of course, Zero Mostel long ago. But also the lesser-known Ronny Graham, who died almost 20 years ago and appeared in many of Brooks’ films.“We wanted to write a musical about Napoleon, but we only ever wrote one song,” says Brooks.“It’s a great song. Give her the lyrics!” says Reiner, but Brooks needs no prompting to perform.“Retreat, retreat! Drop your sword and run  The foe is near, we’re outta here – run!  Run away!  You run away, you live to fight another day! Retreat!” he sings, hitting some properly impressive high notes.“But I think there’s no question the people we miss most are our wives,” says Brooks, solemn again.In one of the running jokes in 2000 Year Old Man, Brooks explains his longevity, for which he credits, variously, avoiding fried foods and airplanes. Brooks and Reiner haven’t made it to 2000, but combined their ages almost add up to 200, so what is their secret?“Eating the food here,” Brooks replies immediately.“Being blessed with wonderful children and grandchildren. Have you ever met his son, Max?” asks Reiner, referring to Brooks and Bancroft’s only child, now an acclaimed writer.I say I have not.“You must! The word genius is thrown around, but this boy is a true genius. And he learned how to do so much himself!” says Reiner, marvelling at 47-year-old Max Brooks’ precocity.I tell Reiner I interviewed his son, Rob, two years ago.“Who?” he asks, having drifted off a little.“Rob Reiner, your son,” Brooks mock shouts into Reiner’s ear.But really, Reiner thinks the secret to a long life is “having something to do in the morning”, and these two men are proof of this maxim. Brooks has been busy recently with the recent screening of an HBO special about his life.“Do you have the DVDs?” he asks, and I assume he is referring to the special. But it turns out he means a box set he has just put out of Bancroft’s movies, determined her legacy is not forgotten. “I’ll make sure you get them,” he promises.Reiner, meanwhile, has just published his 19th and 20th books. Known as his “scrunch” books, they feature pictures of, in one, celebrities and, in the other, famous works of art, but scrunched up, and you have to guess who or what they are. Reiner himself is in it, and his name is given as “Estelle’s husband, Carl.” I thought the books were a bit mad when I saw them, but back at my hotel, I can’t stop playing Reiner’s scrunch game. Never doubt the entertainment nous of a man with nine Emmys (for Caesar’s Hour, The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mad About You) and a Grammy (for The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000) for comedy.Reiner and Brooks’ evening routine never changes: they sit and talk “about everything”, then have dinner in front of Reiner’s massive TV while they watch Jeopardy!. It seems like a pretty great life, and it is.“I don’t think I’ve ever had a better friend than Carl,” says Brooks.“My God, the thought of being without him – the world would be too bleak!” says Reiner, and Brooks’ face falls a little, as if he is envisaging all too clearly a world without Reiner.“Now, come on, Carl, let her ask some questions,” he says.I tell them I just like listening to them talk to one another.“But you might want to ask about something specific, and Carl will be ready, willing and able to answer anything,” says Brooks, buoying them both along.Reiner puts his hand on top of Brooks’. “Always,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2d9aae4fef4272e4b44aac7d99f73f349bfdf/0_173_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a603598092306d6181ed640887ca36","title":"boats burgers and whale bones cambridge for kids","story":"From playgrounds to punts, mazes to museums, animals to afternoon tea, Cambridge is packed with kid-happy things to see, do and eat. Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge. Up to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

So if you want the inside scoop on family fun? Talk to an under-10, of course. Six-year-old Londoner Indy Williams – with help from mum Kate Faithfull-Williams – shares her favourite city spotsI love London because it’s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right near a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. Mummy was happy cause my little sister got in for free! They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon, but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van. They do spicy pizzas for grownups too. The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It’s a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs. Once I saw a beautiful brown horse.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

I think it is the Dreyfus of our age, the way in which a person is being persecuted for political reasons for simply exposing the truth of what went on in relation to recent wars.”The extraordinary claim about the supposed offer of a pardon from Trump was made at a hearing at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday before the opening next week of Assange’s legal battle to block attempts to extradite him. Assange faces charges in the US for publishing hacked documents.A former Republican congressman named by the Assange legal team as a key witness denied the pardon claim.Rohrabacher denied the claim, saying he had made the proposal on his own initiative, and that the White House had not endorsed it.McDonnell said he and Assange had discussed the issue of the reported pardon but had not gone into great detail. “We are hoping that in court he is able to defeat the extradition bid. We don’t believe that extradition should be used for political purposes, and all the evidence – even the recent revelations with regard to Trump engagement – demonstrates that this is a political trial and we are hoping that the courts will see it that way,” he said.“If this extradition takes place it will damage the democratic standing of our own country as well as America. We have a longstanding tradition in this country of standing up for whistleblowers, journalists … if this extradition takes place I think it will damage our reputation.”A protest in support of Assange is due to take place on Saturday in Trafalgar Square and will be addressed by political figures and others such as the music producer Brian Eno. McDonnell said he and others were calling on people to demonstrate peacefully.He alluded to attempts to build a cross-party alliance to fight any extradition, adding that there were Tory MPs who he believed could come onboard. He also believed there were “deep doubts” in government, based on comments by Boris Johnson to Jeremy Corbyn about the unbalanced nature of the extradition treaty between the US and the UK“I am hoping that combination of cross-party support, what has happened in the media, the exposes that have taken place in recent weeks, will ensure that we have a climate of opinion in this country that prevents this extradition taking place.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b86efe6c56bbe1203d756acc1ec18a27ca98325c/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b301a0b08bf1635bc3a30bff75cdd0d","title":"new 20 notes featuring jmw turner enter circulation","story":"At least 2bn polymer notes are to be rolled out across the country from ThursdayThe new polymer £20 note featuring the artist JMW Turner is to go into circulation, as the Bank of England begins a mammoth operation to replace the most popular banknote in the country.At least 2bn have been printed, and the Bank expects half of the country’s cash machines to have switched over within the next fortnight.In Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale will launch their polymer £20 notes on 27 February, with Royal Bank of Scotland following on 5 March. Banks in Northern Ireland will also change over in 2020, but there is no specific date.Judging by the huge popularity of earlier polymer note issues, the Bank of England said it expected to see queues outside its Threadneedle Street head office when it opened its doors at 9am.Not all bank branches will be stocking the new £20 immediately. For example, Santander said only 12 of its branches would have the new note from Thursday. They include branches in Birmingham, Cardiff and Leeds.The note will feature Turner’s portrait in front of The Fighting Temeraire, his tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson’s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It will also be the first note to include the signature of Sarah John, the Bank of England’s chief cashier since 2018.The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, chose Tate Britain, which is home to the most important Turner collection, to launch the new note. The Fighting Temeraire, which is currently in the National Gallery, will be on view at Tate Britain in the autumn for a major Turner exhibition.He said: “I am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another 2bn works of art – the new £20 notes that people can start using today.”The Bank said the banknote will be the single biggest switchover to polymer attempted anywhere in the world. While first adopted by Australia in 1988, US dollars and euros have so far resisted the switch to plastic.According to the Bank of England, if the new £20 notes were laid end to end, they would stretch around the world almost seven times and weigh a total of 1,780 tonnes. The notes are manufactured in England by De La Rue.Unlike the launch of the polymer £5 and £10 notes, Britain’s central bank has not set a date for when the older paper-cotton notes will stop being legal tender, so they can continue to be used in circulation. It said it will give at least six months’ notice of any withdrawal date.The Bank is opting for polymer over traditional paper because it is cleaner, longer-lasting and harder to forge.Old notes removed from circulation are either turned into compost, or burned to generate electricity.Despite the fact that non-polymer £5 and £10 notes are no longer legal tender, £1.5bn worth are still in existence. The Bank of England said as of July 2019, there were 118m old £5 notes and 93.8m £10 notes that had not been returned.But iniduals have the right in perpetuity to bring old notes to the Bank of England and swap them for a new note of the same value.Unlike in the eurozone, where the €50 is the most common note in circulation, the British have traditionally preferred lower denominations.There are about 2bn paper £20 notes in circulation, compared with 1.1bn £10 notes, 400m £5 notes and 350m £50 notes.Despite the decline in the use of cash, the total value of notes in circulation has remained broadly static in recent years. The Bank said it had found that while people were carrying the same amount of cash as before, it stayed longer in purses and wallets than before before being spent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df80e195db40b2a51e5735dfe0021e662623f84/0_145_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=230271af2d177fe43f473d9a38c695ec","title":"eminem his 30 greatest tracks ranked","story":"From horrorcore fantasies to soul-searching nightmares, here are the greatest moments from the Detroit rapper’s tumultuous careerEminem illustrates all the cadences he has mastered over the years, channelling flows from influences such as Tech N9ne and Big Pun like an exorcist summoning spirits, and moving through an impressive 1,560 words in just six minutes. Some critics have dismissed this as empty “rappity rap”, but the fact a 41-year-old still cared this much about his craft deserves our respect.Although Marshall Mathers has repeatedly trashed 2009’s Relapse in interviews, the record, which is a nightmarish ode to horrorcore rap, has aged well – particularly this dread-inducing tale of a stalker who lynches Lindsay Lohan. Critics hated the creepy accent, which sounds like the bastard child of Borat and the Simpsons’ Groundskeeper Willie, but by embodying such a ludicrous pastiche of a serial killer, Em enjoyed a much-needed dose of escapism at a time where his private life was starting to unravel.Just like Jay-Z’s similarly misguided DOA (Death of Autotune), The Ringer is a track from a veteran unhappy with the direction rap is headed. Mocking the supposed cliches of mumble rap, Em is essentially an angry old man shouting at a (Sound)cloud. But after years of disappointing albums plagued with turgid stadium pop, it was just exciting to hear Eminem sound so fired up again – he makes for a very convincing Victor Meldrew.On this overlooked B-side, Eminem tears through the thunderous boom-bap of Black Moon’s classic street-corner drama, I Got Cha Opin. This is that rare museum exhibit that doesn’t bore you to tears, with Em giving his fans a nostalgic serotonin boost after a duo of truly awful albums: Recovery, and The Marshall Mathers LP 2.Much of Eminem’s forgotten 1996 debut, Infinite, is spent trying to imitate the multi-syllabic flow of Kool G Rap over beats that sound like cheap rip-offs from Nas’s Illmatic. But the playful nocturnal funk of It’s OK, which is littered with enthusiastic ad-libs from best friend Proof, results in the record’s most inspired rapping, as an introspective Em uncharacteristically discusses finding God.This shot of cathartic rage is still wildly inspiring, even if its appearance on every video game trailer sponsored by Mountain Dew might have diluted its impact a little. It was also fun to hear Nate Dogg sounding so emo and getting a chance to croon about something other than being a horny stoner.With synths that appear to scream out in pain, this is one of Dr Dre’s weirdest concoctions. The songwriting may be the byproduct of a recluse spending his days writing raps amid Jeffrey Dahmer YouTube documentary binges, but Eminem mostly succeeds in trying to replicate the unhinged tone of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and that’s impressive. Tyler, the Creator said this had “the best flow ever”.On Drug Ballad, Eminem is high as a kite, resiliently throwing jabs from beyond the clouds and refusing to come back down. The funky thrusts of bass replicate the energy of a horny, if incredibly tacky, spring-break party in the nu-metal era. It’s a window into a simpler, trashier time, where sniffing glue while playing with a Rubik’s Cube was somehow considered an attractive personality trait.Turning his childhood traumas into whimsical entertainment, Eminem transitions from being bullied into being the bully, and his nutty turn of phrase and dark recollections of a Detroit high school where even the principal joins in with the beatings are frequently hilarious. Few artists can find light in such a dark setting and this song, released just a few months before the Columbine massacre, presciently hints at American schools dangerously abandoning their outcasts.With jokes about the alleged OJ murders and Lauryn Hill’s mythical hatred of white men, this is Eminem starting to realise his power as a cultural provocateur. The fact he bluntly erases his predecessor (“I saw Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads”) also feels significant, with the Detroit native reshaping the idea of the ascendant white rapper.With a mischievous beat that sounds as if it was crafted by Dr Dre rhythmically squeezing a bunch of clowns’ noses, this is a continuation of the silly pop theatrics of The Real Slim Shady and My Name Is. When Eminem claimed rap would be empty without him around, it was hard to disagree.A bit like watching a white trash family drama unravel on the Jerry Springer show, this intensely autobiographical song works because Eminem isn’t afraid to operate from a place of weakness. Em also shares his mission statement as an artist, rapping: “Give ’em hell for as long as I’m breathing”.Eminem has always made an artform out of killing people and his absurdist pledge to “Throw you down a flight of stairs  Then I’ll throw you back up them” is undeniably hilarious. Scary Movies is a reminder of a time when Em wasn’t just a great rapper, but a great comedian, too.As good as The Slim Shady LP was, it was a bit too heavy on dick jokes, and this highlight from its follow-up showcases clearer artistic growth. A haunting meditation on fame, it’s a paranoid, inward-looking tale of being so famous that you get followed to the bathroom.Rapping over regal music from beat-’em-up game Soulcalibur, Em’s promise to “fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis” projects a larger-than-life confidence. Eminem slashes through the beat like a katana sword, writing the hyper-animated blueprint that Kendrick Lamar and Nicki Minaj would later follow.Originally an Eminem collaboration with frenemy Royce Da 5’9”, Em’s potent critique of middle America proves he was one step ahead of his broadsheet critics. He is operating at the height of his powers, with verses so vivid that Nas even taunted Jay-Z with the barb: “And Eminem murdered you on your own shit.”Em has rarely sounded this dejected, with the artist wondering what he must sacrifice in order to make a million dollars. When he would rap about his personal life later on in his career there was too much syrupy sentimentality and self-pity, but here (where he recalls earning $5.55 an hour) Eminem has never sounded so relatable.The kind of song that might get an artist cancelled today, Superman is a twisted take on the love bops Nelly and Ja Rule were routinely pumping out. Endlessly catchy, it’s the closest Em has come to a club banger, and his problematic Lothario dazzles rather than disgusts because he dares you to take him seriously.Not all of Dre’s beats on the Marshall Mathers LP have aged that well, but I’m Back remains truly compelling theme music for a comic-book villain. Eminem fans the flames by threatening to murder Columbine bullies at this point, he genuinely felt like pop culture’s most provocative son.Playing into media claims that rap music was leading young people astray, rarely has a mainstream rap single been so conceptual, as Em and Dre play the two conflicting sides of the male conscience. Em tells Dre – who assaulted TV host Dee Barnes in 1991 – he’s in no position to lecture someone else on how to treat a woman. It’s still bold.This is a three-dimensional account of what it’s like to be a person with the kind of privilege that might fuel a drug addiction. Em recounts being in an ambulance after an overdose, but the fact he does so while joking about his fears of suffering a cliched death like Elvis makes for an endearing listen.Aware that he was every parent’s worst nightmare, Eminem dissects his cultural influence with real precision. Screaming his vocals from the very back of his throat, he also grapples with his white privilege, acknowledging: “If I was black, I would’ve sold half.” White America showed rappers they could be rock stars, too – punk rappers such as Slowthai and Denzel Curry will have learned a lot from this.Designed to be blasted out of a car in a dingy alleyway at 1am, this abrasive shot of horrorcore is as raw as an exposed nerve ending. Each verse is more unhinged than the last, with Eminem fully embracing his growing mythology as rap’s “angry blonde”.You couldn’t make these kind of jokes today, but back in 1999, this subversive doozy really felt like Slim Shady was breaking through MTV’s glass ceiling. Em played the role of pop culture’s Dennis the Menace ever so well, mocking the misguided idea that rappers should be considered role models over a catchy Labi Siffre sample.Eminem is too self-aware to create truly transcendent moments, but this experimental banger is the closest he ever got to crafting one. Tapping into post-911 paranoia, Em plays the role of the demented ringmaster, bringing you into his garish circus with aplomb. It is basically the rap version of Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite!This is the Rocky theme song reimagined for millennials, with Eminem at his most inspirational while forcing you to empathise with the plight of the working class. It’s rare that a whole generation knows the lyrics to a rap song, but Lose Yourself is more than worthy of that honour (even if Marty disagrees).Arguably the darkest song to ever appear on a diamond-selling album, the murderous chaos of Kim powerfully reflects a misguided lovesick rage. Em switches between male and female voices with an unsettling schizophrenic power, with the bittersweet chorus also strangely enchanting. This broke new ground for storytelling rap, and made your mum lock away your copy of The Marshall Mathers LP in a safe, for ever.This track perfected the juxtaposition between Dr Dre as the world-weary OG and Eminem as his deranged apprentice. Rapping like a cartoon rottweiler, Em chomps his way through the beat in a way that is linguistically dizzying. As far as perfect producer and rapper dynamics go, this remains the one to beat.If MTV had become a little safe and too draped in shiny suits by 2000, this was Eminem attempting to liberate it from its excesses and give pop culture’s trashier icons (Will Smith, Fred Durst) a much-needed king. This was a single so big that it opened up hip-hop to the suburbs and made millions of white teenagers dye their hair blond.Six-minute epics about crazy fans who drown their pregnant girlfriends don’t usually top the pop charts, but Stan’s storytelling was so vivid and claustrophobic that it grabbed you by the neck and forced you to get into the back of that car. This shifted the pop paradigm completely and gave a face (and name) to the kind of toxic fan culture that would later multiply with the explosion of social media. As far as rap storytelling goes, it is unlikely Stan will ever be bettered. This is Eminem’s Stairway to Heaven, and the fact he could even make Dido sound bearable is testament to just how good he used to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfea5b95193d01da63f26323fce23a0207321cb7/0_1012_2730_1638/master/2730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b76b09b2fbab8a3f15d8520c0b55fa","title":"grimes miss anthropocene review 4ad","story":"(4AD)Notionally a concept album about the goddess of climate crisis, the Canadian’s fifth album is actually a compellingly chaotic statement about her own private lifeMiss Anthropocene has had a lengthy, difficult birth. As perhaps befits an album that was announced in 2017, then derailed by ferocious-sounding spats between artist and record company, rerecording, and rejigging of the track listing, it comes with a weighty concept attached. Miss Anthropocene is, Grimes says, a work based around the idea of anthropomorphising climate change into the figure of a villainous goddess (“she’s naked all the time and she’s made out of ivory and oil”) whose name is a conflation of “misanthrope” and the proposed scientific term for the current geological epoch, and who celebrates the imminent destruction of the world.This seems like a more original approach to the topic of global heating than the standard songwriter practice of finger-wagging. But the actual album, now that it’s here, gives the distinct impression of being a conceptual work in the same way that Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is a conceptual work: ie, that its maker came up with a big, overarching idea that they then more or less abandoned after a couple of songs.There are points on Miss Anthropocene when the whole naked-evil-climate-crisis-goddess-made-from-ivory-and-oil thing is in evidence. “This is the sound of the end of the world,” Grimes sings over a haze of noisy, shoegazey guitar on Before the Fever. “I got everything you want, I can make it feel so wet”. My Name Is Dark, meanwhile, is punctuated by screams, and Grimes snarls “imminent annihilation sounds so dope” in a 21st-century equivalent of the horrified relish with which some post-punk artists conjured scenarios of nuclear apocalypse.But for the most part, Miss Anthropocene seems inspired less by climate change than by recent events in the musician’s life. Already the kind of artist whose vast media footprint dwarfs the sales of her critically acclaimed albums – her biggest seller, 2012’s Visions, reached No 98 in the US – Grimes’s profile soared even further when she appeared in public on the arm of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In America, a country that may be even more given to pearl-clutching about what you might call indie ethics than the UK, news of their romance was greeted as if the lead singer of Idles had announced his engagement to Katie Hopkins.Perhaps understandably, Grimes took being held up as the living embodiment of contemporary nihilism owing to her romantic choices quite badly. “Love is the thing that’s fucking up my career,” she protested to one interviewer. “My reputation is at an all-time low,” she told another. It’s the response to her private life that seems to be at the root of Miss Anthropocene, which opens with a song in which Grimes imagines being dragged to some kind of netherworld on account of who she’s sleeping with. Industrial noise rages over pummelling bass, a leaden drum pattern thuds, her breathy vocals keep threatening to sound euphoric – beginning to spiral upwards as the song reaches its chorus before pulling back to somewhere darker and more discomfiting. If it’s a concept album at all, it’s about the toxicity of modern celebrity, not CO2 emissions.And on those terms, Miss Anthropocene works remarkably well: for all the sci-fi theorising, the emotions at its centre feel prosaic, realistic and affecting. By turns it is disorienting (the frantic Japanese vocals on Darkseid create the same mood of panicky confusion as Michi Hirota’s contributions to David Bowie’s It’s No Game) and defiant (“You want to make me bad and I like it like that,” she insists on Violence). But the defiance, the whole how-do-you-like-me-now? idea, isn’t terribly convincing, and is undercut by the overwhelming mood of melancholy in varying shades, from Delete Forever’s resigned acoustic strum to You’ll Miss Me When I’m Not Around, which sets some bleak lyrics about self-harm and suicide to a weird blend of grunge guitar rock and wilfully plasticky vocal samples.Not all the musical experiments work. The Bollywood samples, bursts of lock-stepped drum’n’bass and one-note chorus of 4AM are more annoying than intriguing. But most do. Idoru, a title that borrows a Japanese word for a pampered star, is ostensibly a profession of love but there is something chaotic and shaky about its sound, decorated with lo-fi recordings of birdsong and melodica it often feels like the only thing preventing it from collapsing entirely is the rhythm track.On New Gods, meanwhile, the pretty vocal melody is drowned out by its own vast echo – one of a handful of points on the album where it feels as if Grimes is retreating. Her vocals are so regularly smeared or buried you feel as if you’re straining to eavesdrop. That makes sense: Miss Anthropocene seems a more personal project than its advance billing suggested. It doesn’t add much to the climate change debate, but as a representation of what it’s like when fame turns dark, it is powerful and compelling.Daniel Avery and Alessandro Cortini: Illusion of TimeThe first track from a collaborative album due next month, Illusion of Time is beautiful: a lulling melody doing battle with a slowly rising tide of electronic noise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de59ce3ce85880754de01de579900e72b9aa3891/0_59_5109_3066/master/5109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f6109a90ef6de1b15ec3c184d34fe2d","title":"brits 2020 the best of the red carpet and ceremony in pictures","story":"The highlights from the 40th Brit Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97531905b8d0fb26c40ad8e403eabbde159b07c5/0_74_2873_1723/master/2873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6a08cf110bdea0eb0bf3efffe699e55","title":"can the fashion industry ever be sustainable","story":"Environmental journalist Lucy Siegle has been writing about the fashion industry for 15 years.

Ministers are due to produce a long-awaited white paper on shaking up the planning system in the next few months.Last week the government announced that eight local councils in London, the south-east or east of England would lose some planning powers after failing to meet targets for completed new homes.The LGA found that the number of granted planning permissions for new homes in England almost doubled between 2012-13 and 2018-19, from 198,800 to 361,800.While the organisation acknowledges there is an inevitable time lag between permissions being granted and the homes being built, it notes that over the same period the number of newbuild completions has risen more slowly, from 118,540 to 213,860.The LGA argues the figures show that rather than taking planning powers from councils, the white paper should consider other measures, notably allowing local authorities to build on land that has planning permission, for example by assisting compulsory purchase on such land, and allowing councils to charge full council tax on unbuilt developments.It is also calling on the government to change the right to buy system, under which tenants can purchase local authority homes, by letting councils keep all the money from such sales to help them to replace them.David Renard, the leader of Swindon council and the LGA’s housing spokesman, said: “The planning system is not a barrier to housebuilding. The number of homes granted planning permission has far outpaced the number of homes being built.“No one can live in a planning permission, or a half-built house where work on a site has begun but not been completed. Councils need powers to tackle our housing backlog and step in where a site with planning permission lies dormant and housebuilding has stalled. If we are to solve our housing shortage, councils need to be able to get building again and resume their role as major builders of affordable homes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56017c28981447b79d93958471fcab18748ff68e/0_162_1718_1031/master/1718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5339e3142a492d20aaa81d9ca56c1a0","title":"roger federer withdraws from french open after knee surgery tennis","story":"Roger Federer’s announcement that minor surgery on his right knee will sideline him until Wimbledon at the end of June ripped through the tennis community like a hurricane on Thursday.After reluctantly having an operation to repair freak damage to his left knee when running a bath for one of his children in Melbourne in 2016, he is left with two knees that have gone under the knife.He returned from his first ordeal – and seven months out - to win the Australian Open in 2017, one of the great sporting comebacks. There are no such assurances he can do anything like that again.From the time Federer posted the news on Twitter that he would miss four lead-up tournaments and the French Open (with no guarantee of appearing at Wimbledon), his worldwide audience went into paroxysms of grief, registering more than 10,000 “likes” in half an hour, although there was not much to like.Their concern – and that of the entire industry – is that, at 38, Federer is hurrying towards the last chapter of his remarkable story. While he has had injuries in the past – although few until he passed 35, certainly not as many as his most of his contemporaries – the accumulation of trouble in key areas of his body does not encourage confidence in his medium- to long-term future.“My right knee has been bothering me for a little while,” he said. “I hoped it would go away but, after an examination, and discussion with my team, I decided to have arthroscopic surgery in Switzerland yesterday. After the procedure, the doctors confirmed that it was the right thing to have done and are very confident of a full recovery. As a result, I will unfortunately have to miss Dubai, Indian Wells, Bogota, Miami and the French Open.”He added: “I am grateful for everyone’s support. I can’t wait to be back playing again soon, see you on the grass!”The latter sentiment, at least, held out hope that he would soldier on. The more sober reality is that, having also endured back pain and several struggles at the highest level over the past year, Federer surely knows that adding to his record 20 majors is a dwindling prospect. He might make it to Wimbledon he might also get to the Tokyo Olympics. But it will not be the Federer we have known for most of his 22 years on the Tour.At the Australian Open last month, he opened his campaign with some scintillating tennis against moderate opposition in Steve Johnson and Filip Krajinovic, then suffered through four hours and five sets against the stubborn John Millman (who stopped him in the fourth round of the 2018 US Open), survived a gruelling five-setter in the quarter-finals against the world No 100 Tennys Sandgren and had little left to offer Novak Djokovic, who took just two hours and 18 minutes to advance to the final, where he won an eighth title.It was Djokovic – the toughest rival of his career – who saved two match points against him to win Wimbledon in another extraordinary battle last summer. That might have been the last gasp of a genius. It took Federer days to recover from the experience, and he set off around Switzerland with his family to refresh his spirit.There is only so long he will be able or willing to endure that sort of defeat. What sustains him is love: his own for the game and that of millions of fans for him. A sample of the Twitter responses to the news of his absence shows the depth of that warmth.“Get well soon champ. There are more years to come!” “Get well soon \u0026amp come back stronger, Roger!” “Six months break and miracle happened at AO 2017. Miracle at RG 2020 please, champ.” When reminded Federer had opted out of Roland Garros, that poster would not have it. “Yes, hoping for a miracle.” Because that is what Federer has supplied for his congregation for more than two decades, during which time he has won 103 titles, 1,242 matches (losing a mere 271) and earned $115,969,871.His fans care less for those numbers, though, than the vision they embrace in their rapture. Nobody plays tennis like Federer, because nobody can.When the 16-year-old Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz beat his 32-year-old compatriot, Albert Ramos-Vinolas (41 in the world), in the first round in Rio this week, he told Tennis TV: I like to play very aggressively with a lot of winners. My style is more or less like Federer’s.”He no doubt meant no disrespect to the Swiss, but it was a ludicrous assertion for a player ranked 406 in the world, whatever his potential and self-belief.He descended to earth in the second round on Thursday, losing in three sets to world No 116 Federico Coria, of Argentina. But Alcaraz has left his mark and joins a lengthening queue of young contenders eager to move into the void that Federer, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal will leave in years to come.For now, tennis trains its eyes on Federer, as it has done since he arrived as a similarly precocious talent in 1998, giving another Argentinian, Lucas Arnold Ker, a decent argument over two sets in Gstaad. For now, Federer is world No3. To nearly everyone who loves the game, he will always be No 1. They want another miracle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e121b816abbe6e9fe61f6b93c0e1bca9c7dc241/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16f9c1efe3daf85a0a6113b1d30a17ca","title":"huawei shut out from scheme to see how 5g can link communities","story":"Chinese supplier won’t be able to take part in pilot exploring potential of the new technologyHuawei has been banned from participating in a £65m government scheme to explore how next-generation 5G technology can drive businesses and connect communities across the UK.The government set up the scheme last year, calling on businesses and communities to apply for funding to trial the vast potential of 5G technology.The first trials to receive funds include: exploring the use of the new technology to monitor the environment in North Yorkshire in an effort to develop an early warning system for flooding experimenting with how 5G can help coastal search and rescue in Dorset and testing how it can help the production of electric vehicles in a project led by Ford and Vodafone.However, the government, which announced on Thursday that its funding for the scheme would increase from £35m to £65m, said it would not award any funds to projects that aimed to involve the Chinese telecoms equipment group Huawei.“None of the winning projects, or future projects, will use equipment from high risk vendors,” the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said.Last month, the government, which has deemed Huawei to be a high-risk supplier because of its Chinese ownership, announced limits on the use of the firm’s equipment in the 5G networks being rolled out across the UK.BT, which owns the mobile operator EE, said complying with the new regulations would cost it £500m as it stripped out and replaced Huawei equipment in its network over the next five years. Vodafone has said it will cost €200m (£169m) to comply across Europe, although in the UK it is already almost compliant.The government has committed to a total £200m investment in testbeds and trials across the UK to explore new ways 5G can be used, such as in farming, connectivity on trains, connecting rural communities, tourism and healthcare.“We’re determined to make the UK a world-leader in 5G and deliver on our promise to improve connections for people and businesses across the country,” said Oliver Dowden, the DCMS secretary. “This includes seeing how it could create new jobs in the countryside, make businesses more productive and unleash even more ideas in our cutting-edge creative industries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e04a5591a15a9b4158bc446f86edab61d6b43dc/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85515a160d259960427ab8b51089ad11","title":"how do i get my name to the top of googles search results","story":"An academic shares his name with a notorious drug dealer. Here’s how he can raise his profile so his name appears firstI’m a researcher at a major university. Unfortunately, I happen to share my name and middle initial with an unrelated drug dealer who has been in and out of prison. My name is sufficiently rare that I’m worried that confusion might arise, because a cursory Google search tends to give prominence to negative news stories that feature him.The standard advice online seems to be to open as many social media accounts as possible. I also have my own domain, but none of these has displaced the negative news stories in the search rankings. What should I do? Name withheldHow to get the top spot in Google’s search engine results has been a hot topic for years. It’s still vitally important to all types of business, to consultants and other professionals, bands and musicians, authors and journalists, politicians and many others. For those who can justify the fees, personal branding and “reputation management” companies do it for a living.At this point, all the information you need is online somewhere. The problem is that it takes a significant amount of work, which may or may not be worth it.In your case, I imagine that anybody likely to search for the name of a bright, young academic is not going to confuse you with a drug dealer almost twice your age. They already know that two or, usually, many more people have the same name. The people who could have real problems are the ones who share names and professions. Two journalists spring to mind: Duncan Campbell, a novelist and former  crime reporter, and Duncan Campbell, an investigative reporter and television producer formerly on the staff of the New Statesman. Neither is likely to be confused with Duncan Campbell, the artist who won the Turner prize in 2014, or the Duncan Campbell from the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow, or numerous others.However, the general advice is correct. You need to displace your namesake by producing content that Google’s search algorithms find more compelling than old newspaper crime reports. You could do this by becoming famous, which would generate vast numbers of links to your name. Failing that, you will have to generate as many links as you can through social media, and by writing popular articles, or blogging.It helps to have a distinctive name, so you are off to a good start. People with common names can use various techniques to distinguish themselves. These include varying their first name (Edward, Ed, Eddy, Eddie, Ted, Teddy, Ned, Neddy etc), adding or dropping a middle initial, or expanding and hyphenating their surnames. Some people have become known by their initials, including the American poet EE Cummings and the English author JRR Tolkien. Entertainers can invent stage names, which can be mononymous. Examples include Cher and Sting.Under English law, you can change your surname to whatever you like, and for convenience, affirm it in a deed poll. This can make sense if your surname is problematic or you are anglicising a name. It would be extreme for your purposes.However, the key point is to decide on a fixed nomenclature, adopt it, and stick to it. This could include using the Dr to which your PhD entitles you, and abbreviating your first name. You already get the top hit on Google for this search, so tell people to use it.You should also write yourself an identifying statement. The younger Duncan Campbell, for example, uses “investigative journalist \u0026amp computer forensics expert”, and this appears in his Twitter bio. Google search can use statements like this to disambiguate people who have the same name.At the moment, your naming and labelling is inconsistent.Once you have decided on a name and a catchy (if possible) description, you should update your website and Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media accounts so that they all send Google the same unique and distinctive message. The more you can incorporate your chosen nomenclature into your academic life, the better.After that, it is mainly a question of repetition, repetition, repetition.Google’s results are influenced by domain names so buying appropriate names is a good branding investment. Obviously,  is the most powerful TLD (top-level domain), but most common names were snapped up ages ago. Alternatives include , .org, .net, and .info.Some country domains are popular, and .ac (Ascension Island) could appeal to academics. Radio and TV stations can buy .am (Armenia), .fm (Federated States of Micronesia), and .tv (Tuvalu) addresses. Technology companies have used .ai (Anguilla), .io (British Indian Ocean Territory), .ly (Libya), and .ws (Western Samoa). The .co (Colombia) and .me (Montenegro) domains have broad appeal. Some countries require a local presence, trademark or registered business address, but many people should be able to find a usable domain name somewhere.Once you have a domain, you need to use it, and you have. But one page of static content is not going to hold Google’s interest for long. Ideally, you should have several pages. You could have a landing page that says what you do and why you care about it. You should have an “about yourname” page that links to your university page and social media accounts, and ideally, these should link back to your website. You could have a publications page that links to your academic papers, with précis, and so on.Google’s founding idea was that you could decide a web page’s importance from the number of links to it, and from the quality of the websites doing the linking. A link from the  or the BBC has a lot more “google juice” than a link from, say, Flickr or YouTube, but they all count.Google Search tries to detect and punish techniques such as “keyword stuffing” and “link farming”, so you have to avoid anything that looks deceptive while also trying to reinforce your name and declaration. Links should be natural.Ideally, you should update your website regularly, at least once a month. Google has a strong bias towards “freshness”. The more often you update your website, the more often Google’s spiders will index it, and the better you will score.Prof Brian Cox did not become a household name by publishing academic papers. You do not have to aim for that level of name recognition, but there are lots of things you can do to make your name more widely known. You are, after all, a recognised expert, and your field is more important to more people than particle physics.Blogging became a simple and socially acceptable way to build a reputation online after Blogger was launched in 1999, and it became even more important after Google bought the company in 2003. If you cannot blog on your own website, you can blog at yourname.blogspot, while linking to your main site and social media accounts.You can also post short stories about your research topics at Medium and LinkedIn, and possibly on a Facebook “fan page”, and promote them on Twitter. Aim at an audience that will never read your academic papers. If you are successful, your thoughts will be picked up by other publications. If you are not, it’s still worth doing. Your real target audience is Google.It will take a few months, but you should be able to build up a coherent online presence that establishes your identity, your authority and your continuing activity. Those are the three things that will increase your reputation with Google’s search algorithms, and improve your visibility. You can’t make your namesake disappear, but you may yet be able to outrank him.Have you got a question?

To me, they looked like pagans from a Grimm’s fairytale: shaggy woolly gilets, those bells hanging round their waists, and heads adorned with towering flower-covered hats. Exaggerating their gait to make the bells jangle, they shimmied and bumped their hips against each other as they waved carved wooden figures with a somewhat menacing air. Over the course of a 25km procession, they were here to banish evil spirts and herald the coming of spring. Carnival had come to town.Villagers around Rijeka, Croatia’s largest port, feel pride towards their zvončari, who have been carrying on this tradition for several hundred years. They are also quick to point out that their bellringers, not the ones at Rijeka carnival, are the originals. However, most people still associate zvončari with the country’s biggest carnival, which this year has been bubbling along since late January and will end with a parade on 23 February. This will be when thousands of masked participants in elaborate costumes, pass along Rijeka’s main pedestrianised street, Korzo, joined by floats poking fun at political and celebrity targets. In 2020, though, the carnival has a rival for attention, because Rijeka (along with Galway) is European Capital of Culture. The main programme kicked off on 1 February with a lavish waterfront ceremony focusing on the city’s past as an industrial powerhouse – that at times sounded like the love child of German heavy metallers Rammstein and Einstürzende Neubauten having a tantrum. “Shocking and provocative, that’s what Rijeka does best,” a friend, who loved the show, told me afterwards. “Horrible – too industrial and noisy,” said another. While the ceremony ided opinion, the appearance of 400 zvončari united all in the crowd, as did the spectacular fireworks.What also hit the right note, despite the rain, was the party atmosphere throughout the city centre. I walked past dozens of live performances: rock, jazz, classical. Stages had been set up in squares, on quaysides, in a tunnel, even in the temple-like indoor fish market. It gave me a taste of what’s to come this year, with literary festivals (including one celebrating the short story, in collaboration with Hay Festival), indoor and outdoor art installations and exhibitions, rock and classical music concerts, and an opera and theatre programme at the city’s Italian-style Croatian National Theatre.Many visitors overlook Rijeka in their rush to reach islands in the Kvarner Gulf – Krk, Cres, Rab, Lošinj – or neighbouring Istria. But multicultural Rijeka has a way of beguiling with its Habsburg architecture and legacy of being part of the Austrian empire. Italy once ruled here too, leaving behind traces in cuisine, architecture and dialect. The Maritime and History Museum of the Croatian Littoral is a former governor’s palace designed by the same architect who created Budapest’s ornate parliament building. It was a good place to try to get a handle on Rijeka’s centuries of complex history. Also, it’s not often you’ll get to look at a lifejacket worn by a Titanic survivor – especially for an entrance fee of just 30 kuna (£3.35).A few minutes from here, Peek\u0026ampPoke is a geek’s heaven of I vintage technology and gadgets in an endearingly quirky and overstuffed museum. Next, I crossed the Rječina River towards a stone staircase leading up to one of the city’s most picturesque viewpoints. Trsat Castle, which dates from the 13th century, offers grand views over Rijeka and the Kvarner Gulf. It’s free to wander round the castle’s tower and grounds, and it’s only a few minutes’ walk on to the vast gardens surrounding Trsat’s Franciscan monastery.Korzo is the city’s hub, with cafes that spread along the marble street while graceful Habsburg palaces (and the odd Tito-era addition) tower above. Narrow side streets lead to squares with more cafes and shops, the rotunda-shaped St Vitus Cathedral and even some Roman ruins. The large glass-covered terrace of Konoba Primorska offers a taste of the region’s gastronomic mishmash: squid-ink risotto, sauerkraut and sausages, grilled sardines with chard and potatoes, and at prices lower than elsewhere on the Adriatic coast (dishes from £3.35).The Riva waterfront promenade attracts strolling crowds, as does the Molo Longo concrete pier, but while there are pebbly and concrete beaches near Rijeka’s port, many prefer to take a 30-minute bus ride west to the Opatija Riviera. I took one look at Opatija’s wedding cake-like 19th-century villas and hotels and saw why this was the best place for a seaside fix. The Habsburgs turned this elegant, laid-back place into their own riviera during the mild winter months, a process chronicled at the Croatian Museum of Tourism in the town’s landscaped gardens.I finished by following the 12km Lungomare (the Capital of Culture celebrations include an art trail along it) that hugs the coast from pretty Lovran past Opatija and to the fishing village of Volosko. It’s easily one of the most pleasurable walks along the Adriatic coast. Both Lovran and Opatija are sharing Rijeka’s reign as culture capital, along with 25 other neighbourhoods. It’s going to be one hell of a party.• The trip was provided by the Croatian National Tourist Board, with accommodation at Rijeka’s Hotel Continental (doubles from £76 B\u0026ampB) and Hotel Ambasador in Opatija (doubles from £75 B\u0026ampB).

It was the first debate for Mike Bloomberg, and the former New York mayor’s rivals in the Democratic race for president immediately took aim – attacking him for his legacy on racist policing and reports of sexist comments and discrimination at his companies.In the first minutes of the debate, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders argued that Bloomberg’s legacy of stop-and-frisk made it impossible for him to broaden the Democratic party’s coalition and defeat Donald Trump.The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren compared Bloomberg to Trump in her opening remarks: “Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.”From there, the attacks didn’t let up. Bloomberg gave ineffective responses to a series of stop-and-frisk questions, saying he was “embarrassed” by the tactic deployed in New York while he was mayor: “I’ve apologized. I’ve asked for forgiveness. We stopped too many people.”He also claimed he “discovered” the city was conducting too many stops and that he reduced use of the policy. In reality, a court ordered the city to stop the practice, deeming it unconstitutional.Warren also targeted Bloomberg over non-disclosure agreements several women at his company have signed while settling lawsuits. She repeatedly urged him to disclose how many NDAs women had signed and to let the women speak freely about their experiences. Bloomberg demurred and ultimately refused to answer her direct questions, leading to boos from the crowd.“In my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities,” Bloomberg responded.“I hope you heard what his defense was: ‘I’ve been nice to some women,” Warren shot back.Wednesday’s debate at the Paris Theater in Vegas came one week after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, setting the stage for a primary battle between the Vermont senator and the more moderate candidates. On the heels of a strong performance in the chaotic Iowa caucuses, former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg came in a close second in New Hampshire, where Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar’s unexpected surge won her third place, and Warren and Joe Biden both experienced disappointing results. Bloomberg is not competing in Nevada, but he had been climbing in polls after spending more on ads than any candidate in US political history. He also sat out the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries and had mostly been making his case to voters through TV ads and scripted public events up until Wednesday’s debate.  Buttigieg and Klobuchar, the more centrist candidates from the midwest, were looking on Wednesday to broaden their coalitions in states like Nevada that are significantly more erse than Iowa and New Hampshire.Buttigieg went after Sanders and Bloomberg, claiming that they were “the two most polarizing figures on this stage” and that he had broader appeal.But he clashed most fiercely with Klobuchar. Both midwestern candidates are competing in a crowded central lane, and tore each other down near the end of the debate. “You memorized a bunch of talking points,” Klobuchar said, telling the former mayor he has not been “in the arena”.Buttigieg responded: “I’m used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important. You don’t have to be in Washington to matter.”Earlier in the evening, Buttigieg had criticized Klobuchar, for forgetting the name of the president of Mexico, she responded: “Are you trying to say that I’m dumb? Are you mocking me here, Pete?”Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, also faced difficult questions over her criminal justice record and her recent inability to name the president of Mexico. Even though he’s the frontrunner, Sanders avoided the brunt of attacks and benefited from the other candidates’ jabs at one another. Buttigieg was at one point asked to comment on an essay he wrote in 2000 praising the senator.Following the debate, Warren’s surrogates brushed off questions as to why she had held her fire on Sanders. “It’s about showing who can bring together that coalition,” said Allison Stevens, a Democratic National Committee member from Nevada. Warren can bring “people who look like me and people who look like Nevada together”, she said, adding: “And I happen to be a millennial of color.”Biden’s campaign had deployed additional staff to Nevada, hoping the caucus will deliver some sort of comeback after his poor performance in the first two states led to a significant drop in his national poll numbers. In the debate, the former vice-president went after Bloomberg with some energetic remarks but faced renewed questions about his record from Warren and other candidates and generally failed to break through.With the long-shot candidate Andrew Yang out of the race, the debate once again featured an all white lineup.Before the start of Wednesday evening’s event, groups of Nevada voters had gathered inside the busy lobby of the Paris Theater. “This is the biggest election of our lifetime,” said Linda Gannon, a 49-year-old Vegas resident who showed up to the debate hoping to get a seat to see Buttigieg, her top choice. “I’m a bit worried about him in Nevada, but I think he’s got a shot. I feel confident any of the Democrats can beat Trump. We have to feel that way, and I will support any of them.”Lorraine Oliver, a 68-year-old public health nurse in line to get into the debate, said she recently got a chance to meet Warren in person and was sold.“She has such in-depth knowledge. But she’s not polling as well as I’d like. I need her to shoot up in the polls,” she said, adding: “I’m excited for an opportunity to get rid of Trump. He’s done enough to make people angry. We’re gonna fight back.”Also on line were several Andrew Yang fans who said they were continuing to advocate for their favorite candidate, even though he has already suspended his campaign.“It’s larger than him. It’s about his movement,” said Hannah Won, a 37-year-old arts advocate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c79f608d5941b3d767d6f52430792bb4cc8baf/0_304_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b3c39b327297ba6f79bfcd46c713460","title":"california japanese internment camps apology","story":"Vote comes 78 years after US forced more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent from their homes during the second world warCalifornia lawmakers on Thursday will vote to formally apologize for the role the state legislature played in the incarceration of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent in internment camps during the second world war.This week’s vote comes 78 years after US president Franklin D Roosevelt signed an executive order that gave the US army authority to remove Japanese civilians in the US from their homes following the Japanese military attack on Pearl Harbor. Albert Muratsuchi, the California state assemblymember who introduced the resolution, said he wanted to lead by example and commemorate the anniversary in a bipartisan measure at a time when “our nation’s capital is hopelessly ided along party lines and President Trump is putting immigrant families and children in cages”.Muratsuchi told KPCC that the bill was partly inspired by the current events, including a Muslim travel ban and separation of families at the border.“We’re seeing striking parallels between what happened to Japanese Americans before and during World War II and what we see happening today,” Muratsuchi said.In 1983, a congressional commission acknowledged the incarceration and injustices were a result of “racial prejudice, war hysteria and failure of political leadership”.Five years later, as part of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the federal government formally apologized for past injustices and paid $20,000 to survivors to redress past injustices.This week’s resolution doesn’t call for additional compensation but instead focuses on, and condemns, the California state legislature’s support for the internment camps seven decades ago. California was home to two camps, one in Central California and another near the Oregon state line.David Inoue, the executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, said in an interview that the measure is long overdue.“It’s very welcome, particularly to those who are survivors, that the state of California is recognizing its role in supporting the racism and demagoguery that led to the incarceration of innocent civilians,” Inoue said.He added that the vitriol and rhetoric being directed at the immigrant community is part of a long history in America of “going from hating one immigrant group to another hating another immigrant group”.“All the vitriol that’s been directed at other immigrant groups is felt by the Japanese American community, too. The reason that what happened to us happened to us is almost identical to the xenophobia and racism we’re seeing now,” Inoue said.“This resolution means that people are standing up and saying this is wrong. Hopefully this won’t be seen as another time when people rolled over and let oppression and destruction of families continue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96cb964e74104543865f0c72ec48a1751aafe7e/0_360_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a26aed1669478dd7e03b6dcfa27a013","title":"coronavirus westerdam cruise ship stranded cambodia","story":"Travel options have been narrowed by a growing list of countries denying entry to passengers from the shipThe cheers of celebration have faded. The waving of roses has ceased. Having finally reached a friendly port willing to accept them after nearly two weeks of uncertainty at sea, hundreds of cruise ship passengers stranded in Cambodia by the new coronavirus outbreak are now simply trying to find a way home.“It’s a weird feeling to travel and go on a trip and you don’t know when you can come home,” said US citizen Lydia Miller, 55, who is camped out at a hotel in Phnom Penh, waiting to hear how she and her husband might be able to return home.The MS Westerdam arrived in Cambodia on 13 February, after repeatedly being denied entry to other ports. But the thrill of the moment, has now evaporated for those still facing a logistical nightmare.Travel options – already limited by the number of airlines serving Cambodia – have been narrowed by a growing list of countries denying entry to passengers from the ship.“We showed up in a city unexpected and there’s only so many flights a night and we have a lot of people we’re trying to funnel through that system and we’re putting a lot of stress on that system,” said Orlando Ashford, president of the Holland America Line, which operates the Westerdam.“It’s a math problem: wow many people do you have? How many seats do you have?”Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan are among those refusing to allow passengers in, making flying to Europe and the Americas difficult. Some airlines, such as Emirates, make a stop in Bangkok before proceeding to hubs such as Dubai, further limiting available flights.Still, Ashford expressed hope that remaining passengers would be on their way home “in a couple of days”.The Westerdam, with 2,257 passengers and crew aboard, began letting passengers off on Friday as they found flights home. But that was stopped once news broke that an 83-year-old American woman who had been on the ship and subsequently traveled to Malaysia was found to be carrying the virus. Some 255 passengers and 747 crew members were held on the ship while further testing was conducted.Cambodia’s ministry of health said on Wednesday that all the tests came back negative and that all passengers were reported to be healthy and fever-free. After that, remaining passengers were allowed off the ship.Tony Martin-Vegue, whose wife, Christina Kerby, remains in Phnom Penh, began immediately preparing for her return home to California’s Bay Area once she got off the ship. Now he’s not sure when that might happen.“It’s kind of limbo right now,” he said. “I’m worried about how she’s going to get home.”Kerby said “jubilation and relief” of reaching land has given way to the realization she doesn’t know when she’ll return home.“As the days go on I just feel like the probability of getting her home soon seems to be shrinking as the disease spreads and governments are continuing to react to it,” Martin-Vegue said.

We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years, since Sars,” said Daszak. “We collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world. That is all under threat right now.”The Chinese scientists and their families have been abused on social media and threatened with violence. They are saying, said Daszak, “we are not going to talk, because every time we speak we get criticised and threatened”.Conspiracy theories circulating on social media claim the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are “crackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible,” said Daszak.As with the conspiracy theories around MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination, those promulgating the rumours are in their own social media echo chambers. And as with anti-vaxx theories, the unfounded rumours have then been amplified by mainstream politicians such as the US senator Tom Cotton, and international news platforms such as the Daily Mail.The signatories to the statement, says Daszak, have put their reputations on the line in support of their Chinese counterparts who are being targeted. “There are scientists out there trying to save our lives,” he said. “They have been doing this for 15 years since the Sars outbreak.”The Lancet letter is a “statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting Covid-19”.“The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens,” it says, linking to all the scientific evidence published so far.The director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom, has also warned against rumours and misinformation, speaking of the “infodemic” that needs to be fought alongside the epidemic.The statement continues: “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus. We support the call from the director-general of WHO to promote scientific evidence and unity over misinformation and conjecture. We want you, the science and health professionals of China, to know that we stand with you in your fight against this virus.”It calls on other scientists to sign up to the statement. The signatories have also launched a change.org petition for public support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2db4b6adbd9a2a1891c884ca454cfce5843f73/0_243_6444_3866/master/6444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99a83f994afadce788a68c16661a5600","title":"the highway that determines the future for syria and its citizens","story":"900,000 have fled up the M5 in search of safety as Assad tries to regain last rebel strongholdIt was dawn when the Hussein family packed up to leave their home in Saraqeb. The whine of Russian and Syrian government warplanes had got too close for comfort in the last few days, and the thuds of bombs and artillery fire were scaring Odai al-Hussein’s 7-month-old son, Yahya.Odai and his wife Banan spent two weeks agonising over whether to leave home and take Syria’s M5 highway north, into the unknown. But in the end, the looming violence of Bashar al-Assad’s new campaign against Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in the country, led them to pack up the car. Hussein’s father cried as he bid farewell to his house.The family joined 900,000 others who have made their way up the highway in the largest displacement of people to date in Syria’s long war. For civilians who now have nowhere else to flee, the northbound M5 was the route to relative safety. Now totally under the control of Assad’s forces, the highway is instead the regime’s road to victory.The M5, or Syria’s “international road”, threads all of Syria’s major cities and six provinces together. The 450km (280 miles) artery joins the political capital Damascus to the economic centre of Aleppo. Stretching as far as Turkey in the north and the southern Jordanian border, which then linked Syria to the Gulf states, the M5 was essential for the movement of wheat and cotton, carrying an estimated $25m in goods and commodities every day before the war broke out in 2011.Recapturing the M5 has always been a high priority for Assad. Sections of the vital highway have been in the hands of opposition and jihadist fighters for the last eight years, but with Russia’s help, the Syrian government has slowly clawed back control since 2014, emptying towns and cities along the route via a series of blistering air campaigns and sieges.By the summer of 2018, Idlib, a rural farming province in the country’s northeast, was the only part of Syria out of Assad’s control. The population of the city of Idlib and the surrounding countryside has swollen from 1 million to approximately 3 million as people afraid to wait for regime troops to arrive in their neighbourhoods have fled north in wave after wave of displacement.Even though the area was protected by a de-escalation deal brokered by Turkey – which backs some opposition groups – and Assad’s allies in Moscow, part of the M5 cuts through the Idlib countryside. And in December, Damascus launched a ferocious new campaign to recapture the last slivers of the road, finally taking the last rebel-controlled section around the village of Khan al-Assal last week.The regime victory has come at a high price for civilians. Bumper-to-bumper traffic has clogged the M5 and other roads leading north towards the closed Turkish border, those who can afford the fuel fleeing in cars, motorbikes and flatbed trucks, often taking no more than what they can carry.Even these escape routes have become hazardous options: sniper and artillery fire targeting civilian convoys has killed at least 15 people. So far, the regime campaign has killed more than 300 in bombings that have hit medical facilities, bakeries and other civilian infrastructure in the last three months. Footage has emerged on social media of regime troops allegedly desecrating graves in newly-retaken rebel towns.Regaining full control of the M5 is a major victory for Assad, according to Danny Makki, a Syrian analyst. “The highway’s recapture will inevitably galvanise the Assad government both economically and strategically, despite the losses they have suffered in men and equipment in their numerous attempts to secure it,” he said.“It also alleviates the logistical nightmare of supplying Aleppo and Syria’s embattled north, which has relied on reinforcements and supplies through dangerous and poorly-maintained alternatives.”The Syrian president himself made a rare televised address on Tuesday following the capture of the road, congratulating his troops and vowing to press ahead with the campaign.“This liberation does not mean the end of war and it does not mean… our enemies will surrender,” he said.“But it means that we rubbed their noses in the dirt as a prelude for complete victory and ahead of their defeat sooner or later. We should not rest, but continue to prepare for coming battles.”For the 3 million civilians cowering in Idlib, his words carry a terrifying weight. The situation is already desperate, with the UN and aid agencies warning the area could face “the worst humanitarian disaster of the century”. Turkish attempts to repel the regime advance with an influx of 12,000 troops have so far led to nothing.Aid response efforts are at breaking point. On Wednesday footage emerged on social media of displaced people tired of waiting ransacking an aid warehouse and grabbing what they can. Hundreds of thousands more are camped out in tents and other substandard accommodation on the Turkish border in freezing winter conditions, begging Turkish soldiers to open the border.Hussein counts himself and his family as lucky: they have managed to find an unfurnished apartment in Azaz, which is under Turkish control, although they are already longing to go home.“I heard that regime soldiers set fire to the houses of those who oppose the regime in Saraqeb and I saw pictures of soldiers looting. Our future is unclear,” Hussein said.“I don’t think I am afraid to die in the war, in bombing. But I know for certain I can never live alongside the men who fight for Assad – the animals who have done this to us.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178856.1582143494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"airbnb style short term rentals to be refused applications in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFull-time use of houses and apartments in Dublin city for Airbnb-style rentals is set to be eliminated.

Of these eight were refused planning permission, two applications were declared invalid, three were withdrawn by the applicant and three are still awaiting decision by the council.In a report to be presented to councillors next week, the council said its policy is “to refuse planning permission for any development which would result in the loss of permanent residential units within designated rent pressure zones”.The policy effectively means no houses or apartments, that could be used as full-time rental homes, will be granted planning permission for short-term letting."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Stoppages in other health bodies to go ahead over strike centred on restoration of pay cutStudents protesting campus accommodation rent increases of 12 per cent over three yearsMale calf and his mother Ashanti are on view in the African plains sectionPSNI investigating security alert at house of brother of murdered solicitor Pat FinucaneSupporters of two men sentenced on Monday shouted obscenities in courtroomJack Downey suffered total organ failure after taking ecstasy and morphineAdvertisement refers to internet banking and offers small reward for clicking linkGarda\u0026iacute believe 17-year-old was killed in Drogheda on January 12thCar driven by 16-year-old boy hit wall in Knocknaheeney on city\u0026rsquos northsideData Protection Commissioner says while some breaches mitigated there is a \u0026lsquolot to be done\u0026rsquoAs 33rd D\u0026aacuteil set to meet, Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader tells party negotiations could take monthsPsychologist Claudia Hammond examines the best ways to feel restedCity houses previously approved for holiday rental banned from short-term useCity council refused permission for five houses valued at over \u0026euro1m eachParties and business united in opposition to points-based system and salary thresholdChief executive of hospitality sector says there had been a failure to take into account North\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquounique set of circumstances\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4179564.1582201046!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explosive device found outside martin finucane s home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPSNI said it was currently at the scene of a security alert in the Glenties Drive areaA crude explosive device has been found outside the west Belfast home of the brother of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane. The police said the remnants of the device, which did not ignite, were found in the front garden of the property on Thursday. The Sinn Féin MP, Paul Maskey, said it had been left outside the home of human rights campaigner Martin Finucane. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it received a report shortly after 6.30am that an object had been thrown at the front window of a house in the Glenties Drive area, smashing an outer pane of glass. A vehicle was heard making off from the scene, and on further examination a suspicious object was discovered in the front garden,the PSNI said. British Army bomb experts attended the scene and “declared the object to be the remnants of a crude explosive device that did not ignite.” Two adults who were in the house at the time were not injured as a result of the incident.Detective Sergeant Keith Wilson said a motive for this attack has not yet been established, but it was “extremely fortunate no one was injured in what was a reckless act in a built up area.” Mr Finucane is the brother of Pat Finucane, who was shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries in 1989. He is also the uncle of the Sinn Féin politician and MP for North Belfast, John Finucane. Mr Maskey said the attack was “ reckless and shows a callous disregard for the Finucane family and the local community.“Those behind this device have nothing to offer society. I would call on anyone with any information on those responsible for this attack on a home to bring it forward to the police,” he said. The campaign group Relatives for Justice said it was “absolutely sickened” that a bomb had been thrown at the home of one of its founding members. “Martin has travelled the world to shine a light on state collusion in his brother’s case and hundreds of others. Our solidarity is with him this morning,” the group said. Paul Doherty of the SDLP said the attack was “wrong and shows a reckless disregard for both the Finucane family and the wider community.”“Those responsible have nothing to offer this community. We are trying to build a better West Belfast and acts like this only make that harder. They have to be faced down,” he said.The PSNI appealed for anyone who was in the area of Glenties Drive around the time of the incident, or anynone who witnessed any unusual activity or vehicles to contact detectives in Musgrave Police Station in Belfast on 101 quoting reference 212 200220.

Photograph: Nick BradshawA planned strike by home helps in Dublin scheduled to take place on Friday has been called off.However, stoppages in a number of other State-funded organisations providing health and social services -- known technically as Section 39 bodies – are to go ahead in a dispute over pay restoration.Agreement was reached on Thursday between the HSE and the trade union Siptu regarding the restoration of pay which was reduced during the economic downturn for staff at three organisations in Dublin which provide home help services.As a result the planned stoppage by the union’s members at Dublin West Home Care Services, Terenure Home Care Services and Crumlin Home Care Services has been indefinitely suspended, according to Siptu.The union also said a planned strike at St Mary’s Telford centre in Dublin will not now go ahead.However 24-hour strikes by members of Siptu and the trade union Fórsa at Delta Care National Council of the Blind In Ireland Western Alzheimer’s Co-Action Bantry South West Doctors  Camphill (Wexford), Galway Rape Crisis St Joseph’s Killorglin, Co Kerry and Valentia Hospital are all set to go ahead on Friday as part of the dispute over pay restoration.Siptu has warned there could be similar stoppages in other Section 39 organisations in the weeks ahead.The unions contend that while Section 39 organisations were urged to cut staff pay in line with reductions in remuneration to public servants during the austerity years, the personnel involved have not seen pay restoration unlike direct State employees.Siptu health ision organiser Paul Bell, said: “The treatment of these vital community health workers, who work in areas such as home care, dementia and Alzheimer’s services, is totally unacceptable.“Strike action is the only option left open to our members to policy makers and those who fund the services to sit up and take notice. Siptu representatives have fought long and hard to win a pay restoration formula that could be applied across Section 39 organisations and the continued refusal of these organisations, aided and abetted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to vindicate their rights will not be tolerated by our members.”“Our members in these organisations, all low paid workers, are falling further behind, having endured cuts in pay of approximately six per cent and a reduction in their hours which has had a knock on effect on service users and their families. They now have been left with no option other than to take action on Friday.”“The number of members involved in this dispute nationally is roughly 6,000 and strikes will be rolled out on a phased basis, in every part of the country, over the coming weeks. The amount of money the Department requires to fairly resolve this dispute is no more than €7 million which is small change for the incoming Government but it would give our members a big break.”Siptu sector organiser, Eddie Mullins said: “During this entire dispute our members demonstrated great compassion and responsibility by doing everything in their power to achieve a legitimate objective without affecting services to vulnerable clients and will continue to do so.“Unfortunately, within the sector there is often a blatant disregard by employers who take advantage of the good nature of staff and ignore accepted industrial relations procedures. Many workers in the sector were subject to pay cuts during the austerity years similar to those imposed on their colleagues in the public sector.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4179644.1582205140!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il begins voting for election of ceann comhairle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMarking their arrival at the Dáil with a sing-a-long (from left): Michael Healy-Rae, Johnny Healy-Rae, Elaine Healy-Rae, Danny Healy-Rae and Maura Healy-Rae on Kildare Street. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Voting has commenced in the 33rd Dáil for the election of Ceann Comhairle in a secret ballot that takes place at the back of the chamber.Independent TD and former minister Denis Naughten and outgoing Ceann Comhairle Sean O Fearghaíl, the two candidates, have set out their stall to be elected to the office of speaker of the Dáil.As proceedings got underway on the first day of the new Dáil Mr Naughten said he had been in government and opposition and “I understand every perspective of the House because I’ve lived it”.He put his name forward because of the public frustration with political accountability, which he said was an issue on the doorsteps during the campaign.Mr Naughten targeted the HSE for lack of accountability.The Roscommon-Galway TD said the health service used to hold quarterly meetings but now the sole means of accountability was in the Oireachtas health committee and often parliamentary question took up to 10 weeks to be answered.He also said that data protection measures were being used to avoid answering TDs legitimate questions.“Protections for citizens cannot be used as barricades again elected representative.”He said to applause that it would be an honour to hold the role to protect and re-affirm the rights of TDs.Mr O Fearghaíl who sat on the Fianna Fail benches paid tribute to Mr Naughten and said competition was an essential part of the democratic process.“I seek a renewal of the mandate hoping that they my work of last four years has assisted to make the Dáil more responsive” and effective.He said he worked on the principle of respect for the mandate of each TD and he believed the last Dáil had worked in a more collegial fashion.Mr O Fearghaíl highlighted some of the achievements of the last Dáil including the establishment of a budget office to cost proposals, to emulate the congressional office on Capital Hill in the US.He said they had augmented the parliamentary legal office to support TDs in writing and amending legislation.A number of events included the hosting by the Women’s Caucus of the first international caucus of female parliamentarians and the youth assembly on climate change, “a world first”.Mr O Fearghaíl said he wanted to make the Dáil one that Irish people, “our masters”, would be proud of and to “ challenge, to interpret, to respect and to act” for the people.He added that he would “continue work in promoting and respecting all voices in the House without fear or favour”.If Mr Ó Fearghaíl is elected, it will reduce Fianna Fáil’s number of TDs from 38 to 37. This would put Mr Martin’s party level with Sinn Féin in Dáil numbers. Fine Gael has 35 seats.The opening ceremony of the new Dáil is one of ritual and pageantry as TDs took their place.Proceedings began at 12.04 as Clerk of the Dáil Peter Finnegan recited the traditional prayer in Irish and English.He noted the dissolution by President Michael D Higgins of the Dáil when the election was called On January 14th and the requirement to “meet in the city of Dublin on the 20th of February”.He then read out the names of the returning officers for each constituency before reading the names of each of the TDs elected to the new Dáil.It took 10 minutes to read out the names in the order in which they were elected in each constituency, in alphabetical order.The first constituency listed was Carlow - Kilkenny and first elected TD named in the House was Sinn Féin TD Kathleen Funchion followed by Fianna Fáil’s John Mc Guinness and Jennifer Murnane O’Connor, Fine Gael’s John Paul Phelan and Malcolm Noonan of the Green Party.Earlier TDs and their family members arrived at Leinster House to be greeted by a phalanx of media.One of the most dramatic entrances to Leinster House was by Richard O’Donoghue the first Independent TD elected to Limerick County who arrived in a 1959 Plymouth car.Mr O’Donoghue, who has joined the Rural Independents group said the local vintage car society asked if they could drive him to Leinster House in the car which was used in the motorcade when US President John F Kennedy visited Ireland in 1963 and was also part of the funeral procession for writer Brendan Behan.Vote for taoiseachMeanwhile it emerged the Social Democrats will abstain on all votes during nominations for a new taoiseach .The party held discussions on Thursday morning on the issue ahead of the first meeting of the 33rd Dáil. New and returning TDs are arriving at Leinster House with their families since early this morning.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been trying to shore up support from smaller parties on the left over the last few days ahead of nominations for Taoiseach today.While no one nomination will have the requisite numbers, many will be watching carefully to see how much support Ms McDonald can demand from smaller parties.The Labour Party are holding meetings to decide how they will vote with a source indicating that they may vote against some candidates and abstain on others.Solidarity People Before Profit are expected to hold a press conference on the issue this afternoon.They indicated on Wednesday that they wanted Mary Lou McDonald to rule out working with Fianna Fáil before they would give her their vote.Sinn Féin has also held talks with smaller parties.Mr Martin, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan are all expected to put their names forward.None will come close to the required 80 Dáil votes to succeed, with tentative negotiations on forming a new government ongoing.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has told his TDs and Senators a deal that would lead to a new government being formed may not be finalised until April,Mr Martin told a meeting of his parliamentary party on Thursday, that it could be two months before a new government is formed.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said that time spent negotiating the formation of the next government would be “time well spent”.He told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that while it had taken over 70 days for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to complete negotiations for the Confidence and Supply agreement that underpinned the last government, it had lasted over three years.“Not putting in the time now, could shorten the life of the next Dáil,” he warned.In the meantime there is a government in place to represent Ireland at EU meetings, he said. He had represented the country in Brussels earlier this week and the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar would do so on Thursday.On the same programme Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty said that his party would “explore all options”, but that the “worst option” for the public would be for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to remain in government.Fianna Fáil’s deputy leader Dara Calleary said they were “a long way from agreement” with any party, but that Fianna Fáil was being “far more proactive” in its discussions.“We want to lay down a policy agreement. There is no question of being ‘devoured’ by any one. We are not going into government for the sake of going into government.”Mr Doherty said that Fianna Fáil was prepared to hold discussions with the Social Democrats who had supported Sinn Féin’s financial plans, “they think they will be easier to turn over.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

File photograph: Alan BetsonMr Martin told a meeting of his parliamentary party, on the eve of the first sitting of the 33rd Dáil on Thursday, that it could be two months before a new government is formed.His comments come ahead of what is highly likely to be an unsuccessful vote by the Dáil for a new taoiseach at the first sitting of the House since the general election.Mr Martin, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan are all expected to put their names forward.None will come close to the required 80 Dáil votes to succeed, with tentative negotiations on forming a new government ongoing.Ms McDonald may attract the support of some left-wing TDs and left-leaning Independents as she continues with her efforts to form a Sinn Féin-led minority government. Her party’s negotiating team is continuing its meetings with Independents and others.The brief meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party in Leinster House on Wednesday evening also heard Mr Martin tell his TDs that substantive talks will get under way with the Green Party next week. The Greens will also meet Sinn Féin and others.He cautioned, however, that the process of forming a government would be lengthy and noted that numerous parties would need to hold special conferences to ratify any deal or programme for government that is agreed.“He said it could be April,” one TD present at the meeting said. Mr Martin did not, however, reference any talks with Fine Gael or any prospect of entering government with Mr Varadkar’s party.AllianceMr Varadkar this week said he wanted Fine Gael to go into opposition but did not rule out an alliance with Fianna Fáil. Senior Fine Gael figures claim the party will not engage seriously in such government formation talks unless another election must be avoided.Senior members of the party have privately speculated that the coming weeks could also see President Michael D Higgins refuse a request to dissolve the Dáil. Fine Gael sources say that sharing the office of taoiseach will be a minimum requirement of any so-called “grand coalition”, which would also need the co-operation of the Greens and others.Green Party figures, however, cautioned against being taken for granted and said the party rank and file could reject a coalition that sees it as the only political party with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Debate on the path ahead is also continuing in Fianna Fáil, with some TDs quietly questioning the wisdom of an alliance with Fine Gael, claiming it could significantly damage Fianna Fáil among working and lower middle-class voters.Some TDs also privately believe Mr Martin was too hasty in ruling out Sinn Féin, although most are strongly against working with Ms McDonald. Mr Martin has repeatedly ruled out working with Sinn Féin.The Dáil will also elect a ceann comhairle on Thursday by secret ballot. There are two candidates for the post: Kildare South Fianna Fáil TD Seán Ó Fearghaíl, who held the position in the last Dáil, and Independent Roscommon-Galway TD Denis Naughten.If Mr Ó Fearghaíl is elected, it will reduce Fianna Fáil’s number of TDs from 38 to 37.

At that point, Mr Varadkar will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin and tender his resignation to the President, having lost the confidence of the House. Mr Varadkar would then continue as caretaker Taoiseach, and his Ministers – including those who have lost their Dáil seats – would continue as caretaker Ministers until a new government takes office.Ms McDonald may attract the support of some left-wing TDs and left-leaning Independents as she continues with her efforts to form a Sinn Féin-led minority government.Mr Varadkar this week said he wanted Fine Gael to go into opposition but did not rule out an alliance with Fianna Fáil.Green Party figures, however, cautioned against being taken for granted and said the party rank and file could reject a coalition that sees it as the only political party with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.The Dáil will earlier elect a ceann comhairle by secret ballot. There are two candidates for the post: Kildare South Fianna Fáil TD Seán Ó Fearghaíl, who held the position in the last Dáil, and Independent Roscommon-Galway TD Denis Naughten.The pay and conditions for the position are on a par with a Cabinet minister. The total salary is €175,699 and the holder of the office also has the service of a full-time driver funded by the State. The ceann comhairle is also automatically returned to the next Dáil.If Mr Ó Fearghaíl is elected, it will reduce Fianna Fáil’s number of TDs from 38 to 37. This would put Mr Martin’s party level with Sinn Féin in Dáil numbers. Fine Gael has 35 seats.Gender and ageThe number of TDs in the remaining smaller parties are as follows: Greens (12), Labour (6) Social Democrats(6), Solidarity People Before Profit (5), Aontu (1) Independents 4 Change (1), Independents (19).The ceann comhairle will make some remarks after being elected, followed by the taoiseach and party leaders. After that, the Dáil will hear nominations for the position of taoiseach and this is expected to begin at about 5pm.Votes on the four expected nominees – Micheál Martin, Fianna Fáil Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Féin Leo Varadkar, Fine Gael and Eamon Ryan, Green Party – will then take place.The Dáil’s gender balance is still well below an even split. Little has changed in gender representation since the 2016 election after which 35 or 22.3 per cent of TDs were women. There had been a 40 per cent increase in women being elected between the 2011 and 2016 elections.While every constituency nominated a female candidate – a first in Irish electoral history – 10 of the 39 constituencies sent only men to the Dáil.The Social Democrats have the most women as a share of their TDs. Four of the party’s six TDs – or 66.6 per cent – are women including co-leaders Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall.Labour have the worst representation in terms of gender balance: all six of the party’s TDs are men. The party lost high-profile female politicians Joan Burton and Jan O’Sullivan in the election.After the Social Democrats, Sinn Féin are second best in terms of gender balance. Some 35 per cent, or 13, of the party’s new deputies are women out of its 37-strong TD count.Just 2 per cent of TDs in the 33rd Dail are in their 20s (3TDs) , they are Claire Kerrane (SF) Roscommon-Galway, FF’s Jack Chambers, (Dublin WesT) who is 29, and Cork East’s James O’Connor, who, at 22, is the baby of the Dáil.Some 38 per cent of the Dáil’s new deputies – 61 in total – are in the 40s, the age decade with the largest representation in the Dáil. Fifty-something deputies are second with 29 per cent, or 47 TDs, followed by the 25 thirty-somethings who make up 16 per cent of the new parliament.There are 22 TDs, or 14 per cent, in their 60s.The average ages across almost all of the parties are in their 40s – Fianna Fáil (48), Sinn Féin (47), Fine Gael (48), Green Party (45), Labour (46) and the Social Democrats (46.5) Only Solidarity-People Before Profit and the Independents have average ages for their TDs in their 50s.The oldest TDs are both Fine Gael deputies: Kildare North’s Bernard Durkan (74) and Louth’s Fergus O’Dowd (71), the only septuagenarians in the 33rd Dáil.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Having honed and maintained my “posh” pronunciation for decades, I’m afraid I have to turn a deaf ear to poet Ian McMillan’s plea this week for more Northern newsreaders on TV.It is true that the BBC has been turning down the volume on plummy accents of late. Presenter Chris Mason, who claimed last year that his Yorkshire voice had helped him get the job presenting Radio 4’s Any Questions, has lamented the prospect of others having to change their accents. Yet I found that the decision to alter mine was totally liberating. Life is unquestionably smoother if you are well spoken. Just because you happen to have been born on the banks of the Humber or within the sound of Bow Bells doesn’t mean you have to be lumbered with the accompanying dialect for the rest of your life.Had I not learnt to enunciate my aitches and dropped the long, flat vowels of my early years, I’m certain I would not today score the “Yes, we can possibly squeeze you in” medical appointments, the no-questions-asked shop refunds, and the “Let’s talk at my club” work conversations.This is not fair. But neither, for my working-class parents, are the narrowed eyes and hunched shoulders they are greeted with upon every encounter with authority or any request for service. Upstairs, Downstairs may have been fiction, but the on-screen world in which Miss Hazel could command “tea in the drawing room” while colloquially voiced characters scrubbed copper pots down below reflected my early childhood with uncanny accuracy. Even to a seven‑year-old, opting for an upstairs accent seemed like a no-brainer. Margaret Thatcher downplayed her Lincolnshire accentBarrister and social mobility campaigner Hashi Mohamed, author of People Like Us: What It Takes to Make It in Modern Britain, advises young people wishing to transcend their background to adopt a professional accent for work, even if they want to retain a more down-to-earth register for family and friends. He is right. Tying people to their dialect of origin is not a social mobility springboard but a trap.Of course, adopting a new accent is a bit like owning a really good fake painting: the clues are always there if an expert gets close enough. The west London place names I learnt as a small child are my Achilles’ heel: it is still an effort to prevent the likes of ’Arlesden, ’Ammersmith and Notting ’Ill from slipping out. And, as the late Margaret Thatcher’s slightly strangled tones testified, it is the strong emotions that are harder to express in a voice that is not 100 per cent your own. Still, the only people who generally rumble me are foreigners who attended English drama schools. They recognise the subtle difference between effortless RP and a carefully constructed replica because they had to learn to do exactly the same for costume drama auditions.Even if the ownership of a Peggy Mitchell-twang were to swing into fashion, when you’ve faked it for as long as I have, there is no turning back. This polished accent of mine is the nearest thing I have to a true voice. Just do please refrain from asking for directions if you spot me in west London, just in case.

If we don’t create standards that people feel are legitimate, they won’t trust institutions or technology.“To be clear, this isn’t about passing off responsibility. Facebook is not waiting for regulation we’re continuing to make progress on these issues ourselves.“But I believe clearer rules would be better for everyone. The internet is a powerful force for social and economic empowerment. Regulation that protects people and supports innovation can ensure it stays that way.”The social network said it wanted its recommendations to spark further debate about the issue of online regulation, and confirmed it planned to publish more papers on the subject of elections and privacy later this year.“If designed well, new frameworks for regulating harmful content can contribute to the internet’s continued success by articulating clear ways for government, companies\u0026nbspand civil society to share responsibilities and work together,” Facebook’s vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said.“Designed poorly, these efforts risk unintended consequences that might make people less safe online, stifle expression and slow innovation.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That algorithm has remained largely mysterious and for many frustrating, since there is no way of knowing how it decides which to show at the top.Now the company appears to be testing out a new feature that would allow people to decide only to see the posts that have been sent most recently.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe feature – which has not rolled out to the main app – allows people to click for Most Recent as well as an Already Seen feed that would allow them to see things from the past.The feature was found by researcher Jane Manchung Wong, who has found a variety of unreleased features inside of Facebook apps.If it arrives, the feature will presumably make the Facebook feed a tabbed experience rather than being presented only with one feed of various posts. The company has in the past tested other tabs, including one limited to particular kinds of posts.In 2013, the company announced that it was planning a variety of different tabs that would allow people to see a feed of posts only from close friends or those with music, for instance. It was dropped soon after and there is no trace of it in the app today.Facebook proposes ‘rules for the internet’ as it calls for regulationA Facebook spokesperson said the new update was only available inside of Facebook for now, but that it was considering testing it externally.You can already view your Facebook News Feed chronologically, a Facebook spokesperson said on Twitter.\u0026nbspThe screenshot below is how we’re testing ways to make it easier to find, as well as sort by, posts you’ve already seen.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the problems with coronavirus and the related issues, the company is said to be still on track with the phone.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the new report suggests that the spread of the virus could hit supply, leading to constrained availability for those trying to buy the phone.Though the company is on schedule for the launch it is likely to miss the schedule for mass producing the cheaper phone, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.The company had asked suppliers to make 15 million of the phones ready for the first half of the year, the outlet previous reported. Mass production was meant to start at the end of February but is now likely not to begin until March, it said.Apple’s new cheaper phone \u0027to arrive soon\u0027 despite coronavirusThe claim came soon after Apple warned that it was likely to miss its sales forecasts because of the disease outbreak.The spread of the disease in China – which is a major market for both buying and making Apple products – has led to a variety of issues for the company, including closed stores and slower than usual manufacturing.When the original iPhone SE was released, in March 2016, it was also difficult to buy amid constrained supply. Apple was said then to have been surprised by the interest in the smaller phone, which packed newer parts into an older and smaller design.The new iPhone is rumoured to take largely the same approach, using the basic design found in the iPhone 8 but filling it with faster and newer internal parts.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Capital spending was down 3.7 per cent and exports dipped 0.1 per cent.“Consumer spending, which slumped following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019, will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of Covid-19 weighs on consumer sentiment, weighing in particular on the consumer services sector,” said Dutch bank ING in a report.“Some further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in GDP beyond the first quarter of 2020.\u0026nbsp“But that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full-blown recession.”A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourRidley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic. Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourKerick Howlett on Twitter highlights the fact that both John Wick’s fighting skills could be due to Neo having them uploaded into his brain in the first ever Matrix film, which was released in 1999.He also points out that Morpheus actor Laurence Fishburne’s presence in John Wick could have a larger meaning.The theory also states that John Wick begins with the hitman “grieving over the death of his one true love”, which could actually be Trinity (Moss), who dies in The Matrix Revolutions.It’s unknown how the character returns in the fourth Matrix film, which will also star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Neil Patrick Harris, Jonathan Groff and Jada Pinkett Smith, who will reprise the role of Niobe.Brad Pitt reveals he turned down lead role in The MatrixOriginal Matrix trilogy star returning for fourth filmHow Keanu Reeves could return as Neo in The Matrix 4Last year, it was revealed that the fourth instalments of both The Matrix and John Wick will be released on the very same day in May 2021.Could the two actually be a crossover? It would certainly be a high-concept gamble that action movie fans would lap up, especially if the two serve as two parts of one story.“What if we find out that John Wick is a simulation that’s happening inside The Matrix and the reason why The Matrix 4 and John Wick 4 are releasing on the same day is because they’re about to drop this bomb on us?” another tweeter asked, adding: “That’d be wild, huh?”While that would be exciting, it remains unlikely – although one look at Reeves as Neo on set does suddenly make us think it could be a possibility.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We must differentiate between the two.”Ms Patel later told BBC Radio 5 Live that her parents had faced persecution in Uganda, pointing out that the changes she is introducing do not affect the way in which the UK will deal with people fleeing persecution overseas.“This is not about changing rules on asylum and refugees\u0026nbspand people that are being persecuted around the world – the two are fundamentally different so I think it is wrong to conflate the two,” said the home secretary. “My family were persecuted in East Africa so there is a complete difference between the two.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Fewer than 1.9 million of the total were recorded as wanting a job.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe IPPR\u0026nbspthink tank calculated that Ms Patel’s immigration plans – which replace free movement with a requirement for most migrants to have a job offer worth £25,600 or more – would rule out around 70 per cent of EU workers currently in the country, delivering a “shock” to key sectors of the economy.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet reshuffle: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out  Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage hailed them as “a very big step in the right direction”.Immigration is good for the economy – put that on the side of a busGovernment’s new immigration plan denounced as ‘absolute disaster’What is in the government’s controversial new immigration plan?I’m expecting a big U-turn on Boris Johnson’s new immigration planBut Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea said they spelt “absolute disaster” for the care sector, which has not been granted an exemption from the minimum pay threshold.And the Federation of Master Builders said closing the door on “low-skill” workers would stand in the way of Mr Johnson achieving his promises of massive infrastructure investment and 1 million new homes. Brian Berry, the trade association’s chief executive,\u0026nbspsaid: “It’s simply unrealistic to assume the domestic workforce will fill this gap in the next nine months.”Dame Sara Thornton, the anti-slavery commissioner,\u0026nbspwarned that the protection of vulnerable people needs to be “front and centre” of the debate on the changes, as people-traffickers “will seek every opportunity to abuse new immigration policies” during a period of significant upheaval in the system.Meanwhile, Ms Patel conceded that her own parents – who set up a chain of newsagents after arriving in the UK in the 1960s – would not have been allowed into the UK under her new rules, though she suggested that they might instead have qualified under arrangements for refugees, having faced persecution in Uganda.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not only has she unveiled an immigration policy that potentially devastates our social care sector – detrimentally impacting on some of the most vulnerable in society – she’s also justifying it by saying that those who are carers, sick or retired should take up these jobs.“Yet again, the Tories are putting dogma ahead of the needs of the economy and it’s the vulnerable paying the price.”Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson\u0026nbspChristine Jardine said that Ms Patel’s comment was evidence that the Conservative government “does not care a jot about people’s lives”.\u0026nbsp“Rather than allowing people to travel to the UK and contribute to our economy by working, Priti Patel would rather drag people out of education, out of retirement and out of hospital beds and set them to work,” said Ms Jardine.Social care providers were loudest in their warnings about the blow the new immigration rules would deal to their sector.Migrants make up around 17 per cent of staff in adult social care – 40 per cent in London – and there are currently more than 120,000 unfilled vacancies across the country.The Nuffield Trust health think tank warned Ms Patel’s proposals risked pushing the sector “over the edge”, while Nadra Ahmed from the National Care Association said the government were\u0026nbsp“either not listening or closing their eyes to the fact that social care needs to be on the shortage occupation list”.Farmers welcomed changes to increase the number of seasonal workers they can recruit from outside the EU from 2,500 to 10,000 for the coming harvest.But the National Farmers’ Union urged the government to commit to a full scheme for 2021, so growers can recruit the 70,000 seasonal workers needed on fruit, vegetable and flower farms.NFU president Minette Batters said that failure to provide an entry route not only for fruit-pickers, but also packers, meat processors and vets, would “severely impact” on their ability to deliver high-quality, affordable food for the public.And Martin Emmett of the Horticultural Trades Association said that a “significant increase” in numbers of seasonal agricultural worker places would be needed if the industry was to help Mr Johnson deliver his manifesto pledge to plant 75,000 acres of trees a year as part of the UK’s fight against climate change.“The ornamental horticulture sector, along with other sectors, relies on a seasonal workforce for its essential operations,” he said.“We stand ready to support government targets on tree planting, import substitution, biosecurity and UK production, but the government needs to support the industry in how the shortfalls in labour are to be fulfilled in 2021 and beyond.”Federation of Master Builders\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I think there are all sorts of difficult issues that need to be resolved.”He added: “If you are going out there and saying you are going to advocate things in a finger-jabbing sectarian way, saying ‘If you don’t sign up to what I am saying, I’m going to come and disrupt your meetings and shout at you’, you are not going to win that battle. You are just going to put a lot of people off.”Asked which of the three leadership candidates he would back, Mr Blair replied: “I don’t want to damage anyone by supporting them, so I have made up my mind not to give an opinion on which candidate.“Whatever happens is going to be a significant improvement… If we had got rid of Jeremy Corbyn and put in someone more moderate, I think we would have done a lot better at this last election.”He warned that the next election would be more difficult because Conservatives would have had five years to embed themselves in power and former Labour voters who switched to Tories would find it easier to stick with the party second time round.Describing Labour as being in a “moment of crisis”, he said: “Fundamental reconstruction is what we need now. I don’t think you can tell whether any of the leadership (candidates) are going to do that or not right now.”In comments which will infuriate many Labour members, Mr Blair suggested the party needs to\u0026nbspbuild a new progressive coalition with Liberal Democrats if it wants to regain power.He stopped short of advocating a merger with the smaller party or the creation of a new centrist force, but said the progressive side of politics needed to overcome the birth defect which had ided Liberals from Labour and given Conservatives an easy ride in elections throughout the last 120 years.We must build a new progressive coalition to put Labour values into practice, said Mr Blair.We must correct the defect from birth\u0026nbspwhich separated the Liberal reforming traditions of Lloyd George, Beveridge and Keynes from the Labour ones of Keir Hardie, Attlee, Bevin and Bevan.\u0026nbspThese traditions became separated by ideas around class, industrial organisation, the role of the state and inidual liberty, all of which are time-bound. But they had in common social reform, advancement of opportunity and passionate commitment to fighting poverty and injustice, all of which are timeless.\u0026nbspHow this is done institutionally is for debate. But intellectually and philosophically this is essential. With one qualification. Those Liberal politicians aspired to govern. Today’s Lib Dems would have to show the same clarity of purpose.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

More than 620 people onboard the ship – which was carrying 3,700 passengers – have tested positive for the condition.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollow the latest updates below:South Korean city in lockdown after \u0027super-spreading event\u0027Two infected passengers from stricken cruise ship dieBA announces further cancellations for flights to ChinaNo\u0026nbspcases in Scotland, says NHSReports in Scotland have claimed that a woman from\u0026nbspLevenmouth in Fife has tested positive for coronavirus, in what would be the country\u0027s first positive case.\u0026nbspHowever, NHS Fife has told The Independent that this is not the case. A total of 306 Scottish tests have been conducted, all of which have returned negative results, according to officials.\u0026nbspAs of 2pm on Wednesday, a total of 5,216 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, of whom nine have tested positive.\u0026nbspThe latest set of figures are set to be released at 2pm today.Japanese data on cruise ship coronavirus infections backs quarantine strategyNewly released data from a Japanese research institute appears to back the government\u0027s case that its quarantine strategy for the Diamond Princess cruise ship was successful in stemming contagion of the coronavirus among passengers.Japan has been criticised for its handling of the quarantine, as more than 620 people on board have been infected with the virus and two elderly passengers have died.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the quarantine may not have been sufficient.But a report released on Wednesday by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) showed that the onset of symptoms from confirmed cases of COVID-19 peaked on 7 February before tailing off to zero by 15 February.The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers, according to the report. Later transmission appears to have occurred mostly among crew or within passenger cabins.The NIID is Japan\u0027s top research institute of infectious diseases.The NIID report was very reassuring, said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist from Kobe University Hospital who had been one of the harshest critics of the quarantine.KLM airlines extends ban on China flightsKLM, the Dutch arm of Air France KLM, said on Thursday it would extend a ban on flights to China due to the coronavirus outbreak.All KLM flights to Beijing and Shanghai have been suspended until 28 March 2020, the airline said on its website. Flights are expected to resume on 29 March 2020.KLM had extended its ban on flights to Beijing and Shanghai up to and including 15 March last week. All KLM flights to Chengdu, Hangzhou and Xiamen have already been suspended until at least 29 March.Iranian health officials call for suspension of religious gatherings\u0026nbspIranian health officials have urged all religious gatherings to be suspended in Qom after two more people tested positive for the coronavirus in the holy city following the death of two people.In all, three more people have\u0026nbsptested positive for the virus, an Iranian health ministry spokesman said.Two people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Qom and one person in Arak, bringing the total of confirmed cases to five in Iran, spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a tweet.Mr Jahanpur said all patients were Iranian and the person in the central city of Arak was a doctor from Qom, the semi-official state news agency ISNA reported.He said health officials had called for the suspension of all religious gatherings in Qom, a Shi\u0027ite Muslim holy city about 75 miles\u0026nbspsouth of the capital Tehran, according to\u0026nbspISNA.Qantas cuts flights to Asia\u0026nbspAustralia\u0027s Qantas has said it will slash flights to Asia as the coronavirus crisis cuts into the airline and travel industries.\u0026nbspThe decision to reduce the carrier\u0027s overall capacity to Asia by 16 per cent until at least the end of May is expected to cut between 100 million and 150 million Australian dollars (£51 million-£77 million) from Qantas\u0027s earnings this year, the airline said in a statement.The move will affect Qantas services to China, Hong Kong and Singapore.\u0026nbspQantas\u0027s secondary carrier Jetstar will cut back services by 14 per cent.\u0026nbspThe airline said, however, that the impact of the cuts would be offset by a reduction in fuel prices worldwide, also caused by the virus outbreak as other airlines reduce Asian services.\u0026nbspSouth Korean city in lockdown after \u0027super-spreading event\u0027The South Korean city of Daegu is facing an unprecedented crisis following an outbreak in coronavirus cases centred around a controversial cult church.Mayor Kwon Young-jin urged Daegu\u0027s 2.5 million-strong population to stay at home and wear masks indoors if possible after the southeastern city and its nearby towns reported 35 cases of infection.\u0026nbspThe Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said 28 of these were linked to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus where an infected woman had attended a number of services and come into contact with other worshippers.The \u0027super-spreader\u0027 patient is a South Korean woman in her early 60s who has no recent record of overseas travel, according to officials.

It looks like a zombie apocalypse, Kim Geun-woo, a 28-year-old resident told Reuters.The World Health Organization (WHO) is in close touch with South Korea regarding the cluster of coronavirus cases, after authorities there described it as a super-spreading event.The Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which claims it has about 200,000 followers in the country, said it has closed all of its 74 churches around the nation and told followers to instead watch its online worship services on YouTube.China\u0027s Xi still due to visit South KoreaThere have been no changes in plans for Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit South Korea in the first half of this year, despite the coronavirus outbreak that has hit both countries, Yonhap news agency reported on Thursday.In a phone call with Xi, South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed efforts to combat the spread of the virus, Yonhap reported, citing Moon\u0027s office.\u0026nbspThe two leaders agreed to share information on clinical trials and cooperate on future prevention measures.BA cancels more flights to China\u0026nbspBritish Airways has announced it is cancelling all flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until April 17 2020.\u0026nbspA spokesman for the airline said: In line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u0027s continued advice against all but essential travel to mainland China, we are cancelling flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until April 17 2020.\u0026nbspWe will be contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss their travel options, including rebooking onto other carriers where possible, full refunds or booking with BA for a later date of travel. Customers can also find the latest information and options on BA.\u0026nbspSafety is at the heart of everything we do and we will keep the situation under review.BA added that it would be continuing to fly to Hong Kong.Melbourne in show of solidarity with Chinese locals\u0026nbspA number of landmarks in Melbourne have been lit up with\u0026nbspthe colours of the Chinese flag in a display\u0026nbspof solidarity with China, according to the .The buildings include the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Town Hall and the city\u0027s Arts Centre.This comes as Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, urged people to show their support for local Chinese businesses and communities.“Go and visit a Chinese restaurant, go to a precinct which is dominated by Asian businesses, go and show your support for them, because a lot of them are having it very, very tough at the moment as people stay away,” he said.Foreign Office to help Britons fly home from CambodiaBritons in Cambodia who left the Westerdam cruise ship and have been cleared for travel are being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home, according to the PA news agency.The group, who have all tested negative for coronavirus in Cambodia, are receiving health advice and being helped with commercial flight bookings.The number of Britons in the group has not been disclosed. It is unclear whether some have already come back to the UK.Public Health England said airport health teams will meet the flights and speak to Westerdam passengers about any symptoms.If they do not have symptoms, the group will be given health advice and told to self-isolate at home for 14 days, PHE said.

The quarantine ended Wednesday and passengers who tested negative for the virus began leaving.\u0026nbspThe group of Australian evacuees was flown from Japan in the early hours of Thursday morning on a Qantas 747 chartered by the Australian government.Concern over Japan\u0027s economy as coronavirus spreads\u0026nbspJapanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Thursday the spreading impact from the coronavirus outbreak was the biggest concern for Japan\u0027s economy and he was closely watching developments.Sales from Japanese shoppers and Chinese tourists have fallen at Japanese department stores from February, which warrants attention, Nishimura told reporters after the government issued its monthly economic report.Japan\u0027s government kept its view that the economy is recovering moderately in a monthly report in February as the labour market remained solid, but it warned about risks to the outlook from the coronavirus epidemic.More cases confirmed in IranThree more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Iran, according to the\u0026nbspISNA news agency.This follows the death of two Iranian nationals, marking the first recorded fatalities in the Middle East.ISNA reports that five hospitals have been designated for the treatment of cases.Ukraine protests against arriving\u0026nbspevacuees from China\u0026nbspProtests have broken out in central Ukraine against the arrival of a plane carrying evacuees from China\u0027s Hubei province amid rising fears of a coronavirus outbreak.Angry protesters from the village of Novi Sanzhary blocked the road leading to a sanatorium where the evacuees are due to be held in quarantine for at least two weeks to make sure they were not carrying the virus.Hundreds of police were dispatched to keep order, and some were seen dragging some protesters away from the crowd at the demonstration, which the authorities said had started overnight.The protest prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to issue a statement reassuring Ukrainians that there was no danger and that the authorities had done everything possible to make sure the virus would not spread to the country.But there is another danger that I would like to mention. The danger of forgetting that we are all human and we are all Ukrainian, he said.Attempts to block routes, block hospitals, not allow Ukrainian citizens into Ukraine - this does not show the best side of our character. Especially when you consider that most passengers are people under 30 years of age. For many of us, they are almost like children.\u0026nbspIn addition to 45 Ukrainians, there were 27 citizens of Argentina on the plane that landed in Ukraine on Thursday, as well as citizens from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Costa Rica and other countries.\u0026nbsp(The plane carrying evacuees from China arrives in Kiev)Two deaths confirmed in Japan\u0026nbspTwo people have died after contracting coronavirus on board a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.The Japanese couple, who were in their 80s, died in hospital after being taken off the Diamond Princess last week.They both had underlying health conditions and one died from the Covid-19 virus, while the other died from pneumonia, according to local reports.It raises Japan’s death toll from the virus to three.Read more on this story below:\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And more people now watch YouTube than all terrestrial broadcasters put together.Even the BBCs highest paid star, Gary Lineker, says its time to make the fee voluntary, while Dame Helen Mirren admits its had its day.Yet the Government’s policy has provoked howls of outrage, especially from the chattering liberals who seem to regard the licence fee as a sacred part of our constitution.Their squeals of protest are badly misplaced. The fact is that, by guaranteeing a huge revenue stream, the licence fee promotes a culture of excess and mismanagement within the BBC, which has a budget of almost £ billion and employs , people.Its reflected in the vast salaries paid to scores of BBC stars, far beyond market rates, like the £. million previously dished out to Lineker, £, to newsreader Huw Edwards, or the £, to sports presenter Jason Mohammad.You can spot it in the host of botched or extravagant schemes, like the notorious reconstruction of the EastEnders set, whose budget soared from £ million to £. million.Worse still, a staggering £ billion was spent on the refurbishment of Broadcasting House in central London.There is also absurd doubling up among staff, particularly in the news.Last week, the BBC had  correspondents covering the American Democrat primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, while in  no fewer than  on-air journalists were sent to report on one brief Brussels summit attended by David Cameron.But the lack of any commercial pressure is most easily spotted in the vast, sprawling tiers of flabby bureaucracy.Ab Fab comedian Jenner Saunders once said of the corporation, “It’s become top-heavy in such an ugly way,” adding that it is “an executive-run place for idiots”.A glance through the BBC’s Annual Report for  shows just how correct she was.On these pages, I counted no fewer than eight managers who had “Human Resources Director” in their job titles, all of them on at least £,-a-year.Among them were: Dale Haddon, “HR Director, News and Employee Relations”, on up to £, Rachel Currie, “BBC Group HR Director” on up to £, and Gillian Taylor, “HR Director” on £,.It was the same story with BBC News, whose regiment of well-healed officials included: Fran Unsworth, the “Director of News” on £, Gavin Allen, “Head of News Output” on £, and Jonathan Munroe, Head of Newsgathering” on £,.This grasping spirit prevails throughout the bloated organisation, from the £, “Director of Nations and Regions” to the £, “Director of Radio and Education.”Insulated by public funding, the corporation adores both navel-gazing and self-promotion. So it has a “Director of Communications” on £,-a-year, a “Director of Policy” on £, and a “Director of Editorial Policy” on £,.All that puts into perspective the current moans from the BBC about the need for cuts.But apart from the managerial excess, what also aggravates is how the corporation uses its publicly-funded muscle to promote a fashionable, London-centric agenda.As the state’s monopoly broadcaster, the BBC should be utterly impartial.Yet its output is dominated by trendy political messages on immigration, climate change, Tory cuts, ersity and poverty.The BBC might have lavished reporters on the Democrat primaries, but it gave hardly any live coverage to the recent celebrations in Parliament Square at the moment of Brexit.Typically a Newsnight discussion  that evening – held in a studio bedecked with the blue and gold of the EU - featured two Remainers and one Brexiteer.Left-wing propaganda is continually crowbarred into everything from drama to discussion programmes.Just  per cent of the national workforce is employed in the public sector, yet the BBC is filled with the voices of state employees, most of them whining about under-funding.Left-wing opinions have a stranglehold most topical comedy shows, such as Radio Four’s News Quiz, hosted by the achingly unfunny Nish Kumar.It was Kumar who recently caused a storm by sneeringly presenting an edition of the BBC children’s show “Horrible Histories”, in which Britain’s Victorian past was held up for ridicule.The BBC can get away with this because of its lucrative monopoly as the state’s only broadcaster. It has abused that privileged position for too long.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one is suggesting you won’t have Strictly Come Dancing or Match of the Day or even Question Time and Newsnight.But the media is fundamentally changing. Consumer choice – what you or me choose to consume on the box or on our iPads or phones and at what time – is king.The idea that by  paying £. for a service that we may choose not to watch or listen to AT ALL is insanity.It might be unpleasant for BBC lers but the time has come to accept that the licence fee must evolve into a subscription service, so that the corporation is accountable to viewers and not the current behemoth that puts local newspapers out of business, that competes with national newspaper websites to write about Love Island, and that makes podcasts like Reality Tea all about the MTV reality series Geordie Shore.That is NOT public service broadcasting. It is a blatant and constant attempt to undercut struggling commercial rivals.But a sea change is coming. I truly feel it.Sure, there might be disagreement at Downing Street about exactly what that change will involve.Personally I’m on the side of Dominic Cummings who wants wholescale cuts. Sell Radio  and Radio , shut down the sweeping BBC Online department and focus on true public service programming that won’t be provided where. Then in  allow people the choice about whether they want to pay for what they watch from the BBC or not.But the plan by Boris Johnson - who The Times reports this morning fancies an evolution not a revolution - is also valid. The first step to decriminalise the licence fee is the start of bringing the BBC back in line.The fact we’re even having this discussion is the fault of the BBC, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and lacking in political impartiality in recent years.It disgraced itself over its coverage of Brexit. It proved it was no longer in touch with vast swathes of the country the folk outside of London who don’t spend their days eating quinoa salads and quaffing champagne with other members of the liberal media elite.It proved itself out of touch for failing to predict the biggest story at the most recent election: Boris Johnson’s historic toppling of Labour’s northern red wall.But what’s most telling is the fact some of the BBC’s biggest proponents are now speaking out to insist the corporation must adapt to change. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: The Mega Agency Dame Helen Mirren is the latest celeb to e into the debate over the licence feeShe said this week: “I think the that the licence fee has had its day.”She joins the BBC’s highest paid presenter Gary Lineker who has said it should be abolished.In all honesty though so should his contract, which costs licence fee payers £. million a year for minimal work.Radio ’s Evan Davis last week said the BBC needs to axe radio stations and either BBC or BBC rather than keep trimming costs around the edges.The need for genuine change at the BBC has reached a tipping point.It has to happen now.

Will this plan do much to bring down the overall immigration numbers as the Tories have long promised EXTINCTION Rebellion “activists” who dug up a lawn at Cambridge University are nothing more than virtue-signalling thugs.If lads from a local estate were caught vandalising such hallowed grounds, they’d be roundly rebuked. But some — thankfully not the cops, who have made two arrests — want to make excuses for the children of middle-class dons.We sympathise with the general cause: recent floods are a timely reminder that action on climate change can’t wait.But how does destroying the hard work of grafting gardeners win over anyone to their side If Extinction Rebellion activists want to make themselves useful, they can head up North and help out with Storm Dennis relief efforts.If not, they should skedaddle before they embarrass themselves any further.NEW Conservative MP Ric Holden is bang on the money: the toilet tax takes the... proverbial. Because of a weird loophole in the law, public toilets are liable for business rates.That means councils which own public toilets have to stump up the considerable cost of running them — and a whacking great tax on top of that.Councillors don’t like their precious cash being sucked down the pan, so are falling over each other to shut them.And the results have been disastrous for those with medical issues that make public lavs a godsend.According to the Royal Society of Public Health, one in five people don’t leave their homes as often as they would like to because they can’t be confident of finding a loo when they need one.If Rishi Sunak is looking to prove he’s got his head screwed on, scrapping the toilet tax would be a good place to start.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Where is their future now  I think it’ll be dficult for them to find a way back in the Royal Family.”Details of the couple’s Megxit agreement emerged yesterday as the pair prepare to step down from royal duties at the end of next month.Harry, , and Meghan, , have been ordered to close their office at Buckingham ­Palace from April .They have been allowed to keep their HRH titles but have been forced to accept that they will not use them publicly as they tout for business around the globe.The couple are also likely to have to remove the lucrative “royal” from their long-cherished Sussex Royal branding — despite spending tens of thousands on a new Sussex Royal website to complement their Instagram feed, which has more than .million ­followers.They have already tried to trademark Sussex Royal, which they want to use to flog countless trinkets from bandanas to notebooks.It is also likely to mean rebranding their charitable organisation called Sussex Royal, The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Talks were said to be continuing on the use of the word “royal” but the Queen and officials have reportedly told them it would be untenable.The Sussexes have already agreed to repay the £.million of taxpayers’ money used to refurbish their Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor and are expected to pay a commercial rent for it of about £, a month.Last night, Ingrid Seward, editor in chief of Majesty magazine, said: “It seems as though they are retaining a lot of things but not actually being able to use them — like the HRH title and Harrys military position.They are obviously not going to be able to use the word ‘royal’ on their website. They obviously are royal but can’t call themselves that. They have those things but their hands are very tied. It’s almost like the man who wasn’t there.”Mr Wharfe, a former bodyguard for Princess Diana, said Harry and Meghan would be hugely disappointed with the outcome.He said: “They’d want to keep that Sussex Royal brand name — they haven’t. Without that brand it’s going to be much more dficult for their charitable causes because that was their trademark.“I think they’d want to keep the office at Buckingham Palace as well, which they now don’t have. Harry would also have wanted to have kept using the HRH title but he can’t. He will be incredibly disappointed with that.”Royal commentator Phil Dampier said the Queen had stood firm during the negotiations.He added: “Harry and Meghan have got what they wanted in the fact that they now have the freedom to make as much money as they like — but at what cost in this settlement “I don’t think Harry would have expected it to cost them so much. The Queen has not allowed a situation where they have the best of both worlds. If they are out, then that is it. No office, no titles and they cannot even use the word ‘royal’.“It will be interesting to see the public reaction to them at the events they have upcoming. It will be interesting to seethey get a warm welcome or any mixed reaction, even hostility.”Royal expert Dickie Arbiter added: “The Queen is always going to stick to her guns and make it very clear —you’re turning your back on being a full-time royal then there are conditions under which you can do it. Her Majesty has stuck to her guns.”The Sussexes are expected to be in Britain regularly over the next few months with Harry at an Invictus Games event with rock star Jon Bon Jovi on February .They will attend the Endeavour Fund awards on March  and the Duke will be at Silverstone with F racing driver Lewis Hamilton the following day.The pair will be at the Mountbatten Festival of Music on March  and Meghan will mark International Women’s Day the next day.The couple will also join the Queen and the Royal Family for the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March .A spokeswoman for the Sussexes said the couple would announce details of their new non-profit organisation later in the year.The spokeswoman said Harry’s priorities remained supporting the welfare of servicemen and women, conservation, sport for social development,HIV and Travalyst which works to mobilise the tourism and travel industry for social good.Meghan would continue to focus on women’s empowerment, gender equality and education, she added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was on the bonnet of the car and thinking he was going to die.In his statement the kosher butcher said: I heard a really, really loud excessive revving behind me and the next thing I was on the bonnet, hurtling at speed.I thought I was going to die and at the last second it swerved into a pharmacy. I realised my leg was broken and everything was blurry.I know the rabbi behind the wheel, he is a good man it was one hundred per cent and accident and he will be suffering. It has affected my le, but Im happy to be alive.Mr Elkouby, who was using a walking stick, was not able to get out the way of the Jaguar.Mr Alexander explained: You will see on the CCTV he tried to move out of the way but the car is moving at speed.The car collides with him and he is carried into the front window of the ­pharmacy.He later told police: A car came across the pavement and hit me directly as I tried to escape.I lost consciousness and woke up under the car and said a prayer as I thought I was going to die.Both men ended up in the front of the wrecked pharmacy in Golders Green Road, with Mr Elkouby suffering serious injuries and Mr Richards ­sustaining  leg fractures.Following the crash, Berisch, who lives in Golders Green, told police he had been trying to help a woman he knew to park her car.He said: I put the car in drive, I don’t know what happened.

It was one of the issues on which Mr Cummings and Sajid Javid disagreed before the latter quit as Chancellor last week.But Mr Javid’s replacement, Rishi Sunak, is a No loyalist and thought unlikely to block any attempt to end the freeze on March .During the election, the PM told The Sun he had “absolutely no intention” of raising fuel duty.But allies of Mr Johnson and the new Chancellor refused to rule it out yesterday. One said: “Rishi is still getting his feet under the desk. There have been no decisions yet.”Experts say a five-year freeze will cost the Government about £billion a year.But Tory MP Robert Halfon told The Sun: “This war on motorists has got to stop.”And Howard Cox, of the FairFuel campaign, said ministers should be trying to cut fuel duty and that any rise would be “devastating to hard-pressed motorists”.It is one of several tax rises being considered.In talks yesterday, the PM and Mr Sunak were said to be looking at raids on pension tax relief and council tax rises for the rich.No declined to comment.For smart city types blessed with excellent transport links, the increase would be a nuisance.But for the Prime Minister’s new wave of voters who switched to Tory — ordinary grafters living in towns and villages — it’d be downright disastrous.Everywhere you look, these people are being hammered by the cost of living.Millions of Brits work hard day and night, yet come home to brown envelopes with yet more demands to pay. Energy bills, council tax, parking costs, phone bills, food bills — up, up, up.Of course, it’s great that the Government is investing £billion in bus and cycling routes to make le that bit cheaper for commuters. That’s exactly the sort of policy we’ve been calling for.But it can’t come at the expense of Britain’s  million drivers. On this occasion, Boris must ignore Dominic Cummings and use his common sense.Whacking voters with a whopping great tax for the privilege of taking their kids to school won’t make him any friends.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnsonaposs top adviser Dominic Cummings is said to have demanded a hike in taxes for Britainaposs  million drivers - by ending a freeze that has lasted since the Tories took power. A Treasury source would neither confirm or deny any details of the Budget. During the election, the Prime Minister said he had absolutely no intention of ending the fuel duty freeze. But the most recent year of the freeze alone - excluding the cost of all eight previous years - will cost the Treasury £.bn over five years.By comparison, Boris Johnson announced £bn last week for buses and cycling put together.Meanwhile the PM is trying to appear to lead the way on the environment - and needs funds for the massive infrastructure drive demanded by Tory MPs in the Midlands and North. According to The Sun, the tax is set to go up by around p a litre but could be delayed until next year. Thataposs in stark contrast to previous reports in August last year - which claimed the first Budget under Boris Johnson would actually cut fuel duty.

The former Prime Minister said the party must correct a defect from our birth and reunite the long-split traditions of the old Liberal Party and the Labour Party. Mr Blair even didnapost rule out a full-blown formal alliance with the Lib Dems - saying: “How this is done institutionally, that’s a matter for debate. Asked directly he said: I literally donapost know at this stage. It could go in a number of dferent directions. He warned simply ditching Jeremy Corbynaposs left-wing agenda wouldnapost be enough to win power - and said todayaposs Lib Dems must aspire to govern and show clarity of purpose. The ex-PM spoke on the th anniversary of the Labour Party as he claimed Brexit could have been stopped -only there had been serious opposition. But he admitted there was no going back on Brexit now. AskedLabour should campaign to rejoin the EU he said: No, you just canapost Iaposm afraid. Long term, who knows. The Lib Dems spent five years in Coalition with the Tories. But as the party elects a new leader this summer it is set to be gripped by a key debate on where to stand politically. Some in the party want to hold the centrist line on economic policy. Others want to take the Lib Dems back to the more centre-left traditions it held in the early s, when the party was a voice against the Iraq War. In a key intervention in the partyaposs leadership race, Mr Blair said Labour has an “extraordinary attachment” to retreating to “a narrow part of the left” - instead of aiming for the centre ground where he stood. “If Labour becomes more moderate and less extreme, of course it will do better,” the former PM said. “But not much. The problem is that we have defined radical politics by a policy agenda which is hopelessly out of date, with ‘moderate’ politics being just a milder version of it.  Outlining a string of ways to win power, he said: First, we must build a new progressive coalition, to put Labour values into practice. “We must correct the defect from our birth that separated the liberal reforming traditions of Lloyd George, Beveridge and Keynes from the Labour ones of Hardy, Attlee [and] Bevan. “These traditions became separated by ideas around class, industrial organisation, the role of the state and inidual liberty - all of which ideas are time bound. “But they had in common social reform, advancement of opportunity, passionate commitment to fighting poverty and injustice, all of which are timeless.

David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, are being treated in a Japanese hospital after being taken from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been quarantined near Yokohama, Japan. They have said they are in the best place as dozens of other Britons prepare to fly back to the UK. The ship has seen more than  cases of coronavirus, including at least four Britons, and is the largest cluster of cases outside China. Around  other Britons from the ship - who have tested negative - are due to fly back to the UK from Tokyo on Friday. They will land at the Boscombe Down Ministry of Defence base near Salisbury, Wiltshire, in the early hours of Saturday morning UK time.  In a Facebook post, Mr Abel said: We arrived in lovely hospital a couple of hours ago. Taken by ambulance blues  twos the entire journey. Outside the hospital I came over a bit weird and nearly passed out. Every pore on my body opened and i was wheelchaired to our room. Full health inspection and now we know whataposs going on. We both contracted a coldand it has not yet turned into pneumonia. . Tomorrow the big tests commence. chest x-rays, ECG, chest scan, urine + more. We are both in the best place! They do know what they are doing and our two nurses are gorgeous. Sally likes the Dr too.  Mr Abel said that following treatment, the couple will need three rounds of all-clears on coronavirus tests. He added: Wi-fi will not work for me, so this will be the final communication for some time. See you all before you know it. In further posts, Mr Abel said his we Sally had a bed in the same room as him and that they were thinking of all the Brits flying to UK tomorrow. He also said it was impossible to send or receive emails and he was unable to contact the British embassy or his family. Another British national on the ship who has recovered from the virus posted on Facebook on Wednesday to say he is heading home. Alan Steele wrote: Informed we will have to do another weeks quarentine back in blighty although japan has set me free as all ok.Meanwhile, two other British passengers, Alan Sandford and his we Vanessa, said they were very happy to be flying back to the UK. The Foreign Office has told Britons to stay on the ship while arrangements are made for them to disembark. Mr Sandford, from Nottinghamshire, told BBC Breakfast they had both been given a certicate saying their coronavirus tests were negative. He added the last few weeks had certainly tested us and been a major inconvenience but, because they were both fit and well, they had been able to cope. Other passengers had faced much more dficult circumstances, he said, such as getting ill or being split up from their partners. When I think of other people - like those on the inside cabins who have got no daylight coming in at all - itaposs horric really, he added.  Those passengers who are fit to fly home from the Diamond Princess will do so, while any Briton confirmed with the virus will stay in Japan for treatment. Passengers brought back to the UK on Fridayaposs evacuation flight will be taken to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral for  days of quarantine. Meanwhile, Britons in Cambodia who left another cruise ship, the Westerdam, and who have been cleared for travel are being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. The group are receiving health advice and being helped with commercial flight bookings. All have tested negative after one case was diagnosed on board.  The number of Britons in the group has not been disclosed, and it is unclear whether some have already come back to the UK. Public Health Englandsaid airport health teams will meet the flights and speak to Westerdam passengers about any symptoms. If they do not have symptoms, passengers will be given health advice and told to self-isolate at home for  days, PHE said.

Pictures show the arrival of the dukeaposs daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie - as rumours abound that guests declined to attend the celebration of the milestone birthday. The Prince is celebrating his th with a private lunch at Royal Lodge, the royal residence which he shares with ex-we and mother of his daughters, Sarah Ferguson. Amid the public outcry over Andrewaposs relationship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, several of the Dukeaposs friends were unavailable for the party, the Daily Mail reported. Ex-we Sarah - known as aposFergieapos - who has stood by Andrew during the scandal, reportedly asked her personal assistant Jane Clarke to send out extra invites after so many friends shunned the event. It is understood the party has been scaled down to a low-key gathering of around  close friends and relatives. Andrewaposs milestone birthday has been overshadowed by the public backlash over claims he had sex with Epstein sex slave Virginia Giuffre when she was aged , which he denies, and his car-crash interview with BBC Newsnight after which he was accused of failing to show regret for his friendship with the predatory financier. The Queenaposs son had hoped to be surrounded by family, friends and charity colleagues at a glitzy party - but Her Majesty signicantly downgraded the plans after effectively apossackingapos him from his royal duties, while charities cut all ties with him.  Andrew had hoped to mark the landmark occasion with a big party, similar to the one the Queen hosted for Prince Charlesaposs th in . Nothing quite illustrates the Duke of Yorkaposs dizzying fall from grace than the manner in which a number of his friends — or those he thought of as friends — have shunned the chance to join him tomorrow on his th birthday, the Mailaposs Sebastian Shakespeare writes. The Dukeaposs th birthday had seen ious celebs and high-society figures attend. In a further blow to Andrew, government buildings were not be required to fly the Union flag to mark his birthday.  A Culture department spokesman said: Following the decision by the Duke of York to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, there is no longer a requirement for UK Government buildings to fly the Union flag on Wednesday February . Liverpool Town Hall is among those that will not fly the flag.

They said the best thing for me to do was to lose weight.  n“I didn’t want to join a gym or any of the slimming groups as they didn’t appeal to me.  n“My son Joshua is autistic and needs a lot of care. He was one of the reasons why it was important to become healthier.”  nAfter signing up to the digital-focused plan, Lynne was a set of ‘smart’ scales and an activity tracker that links with the app, allowing her to monitor her weight-loss progress and daily step count.  n  naposI match with guys in Tinder then have to work out how to tell them I have cancerapos  nShe was also sent a recipe book, a meal plan and daily motivational articles, and was added to an online peer support group - hosted by a qualied dietitian offering daily advice.  nThe digital aspect meant she still had the motivation to shed the pounds without having to stand up in front of a room of strangers and talk about her weight.  nShe said: I lost weight straight away. It’s really easy to stick to and because I’m eating healthily, my husband, Lee, is too - he’s lost two stone.  n  nMum-of- who only wanted two kids has message to people who call her irresponsible  n“The biggest change I’ve made is creating meal plans and sticking to the meals, using their recipes and keeping a food diary.”  nShe swapped fast food for freshly cooked dishes, including a number of delicious treats like chocolate-covered desserts, muffins and curries. She was also told that nothing was off limits, meaning she could treat herself to the odd glass of wine.  nShe said: “I really don’t feel as though I’m missing out on anything - and I’ve cooked things I wouldn’t normally cook. The things we do like eating, we’ve found an alternative way of cooking them, or substituted it with something .  n“There’s nothing you can’t have as long as you have it in moderation or that you’re very mindful that what you’re having is a treat.  n  naposTradweapos who believes women should apossubmitapos to husbands and aposspoil them like itaposs apos  n“On a Friday night, my husband and I will sometimes have a bottle of wine with our neighbours or we’ll enjoy a takeaway - I will choose a healthier option though.  n“I’ve given some of my recipes to my father-in-law, who is diabetic, and my mother-in-law who is at risk - and she’s lost lbs.”  nLynne also started walking every day, slowly at first, beginning with , steps, gradually increasing it to , over the duration of the -week programme.  nLynne has stopped an incredible st and now weighs st lbs, saying the weightloss has also helped ease the pain of the arthritis she has in her knee.  nSheaposs also bought herself a dog, and walking Aubrey gives her a reason to get out exercising over the weekend.  n  nBritainaposs tiniest teen who stands at just  inches tall had to make agonising choice  nShe said: I’ve wanted a dog all my married le, but my husband always used to say that I would never walk it or take care of it. But after I’d lost a couple of stone, he agreed that I could get a puppy.  n“I have a beautul chocolate labrador called Aubrey - she’s  weeks now and she is taken for walks all the time. Having a dog helps me to get out at the weekend.  n“My son is overweight too - because of his autism, he has a very restricted diet and we have to stick to very specic things. So it’s been great for us to take the dog out together for a couple of hours.  n“I’m now much more active with him over the weekends. But le hasn’t hugely changed - which is a good thing.

Dad-of-two Andy Winrow says the vehicle burst into the flames while parked on his driveway as he, his we, and children Aidan, nine, and Isaac, , were fast asleep in their home in Walton, Liverpool.But the car giant is refusing to admit fault, leaving the family £, out of pocket, the Liverpool Echo reports.The fire, in the early hours of January , left the Vauxhall Mokkaaposs front completely burnt out and caused severe damage to the Mr Winrowaposs driveway and fence . Thankfully, the family escaped their house as huge flames raged. Describing the scene, Mr Winrow, , said: There were huge flames and we were lucky we managed to escape unharmed. A fire service report has attributed the cause of fire to an electrical fault with the car, which they bought from Lookers dealership in St Helens in October. But despite contacting Vauxhall Motors multiple times - including writing to MD Stephen Norman - Mr Winrow says the company will not accept liability because the burnt-out vehicle was crushed before the accidentaposs cause could be investigated.  I was waiting for Vauxhallaposs insurers to examine the car, but instead they contacted me to say the car had been crushed before an investigation had taken place. That meant they had no way of finding out how the car went on fire, he continued. As a result, the Winrows have lost the £, deposit they paid for the Mokka under the PCP finance scheme, where cars are leased for a number of years before being ed to the dealers or bought outright. A spokesperson for Vauxhall says they are unable to establish the fireaposs cause and that any number of factors can be responsible - from poor maintenance to external influences. Firstly, we are sorry to hear of the incident concerning Mr and Mrs Winrowaposs vehicle, they said. Vauxhall Motors’ Customer Care team was first contacted by Mrs Winrow on January . They gathered information about the incident, before contacting the customer’s insurer, whose agent had possession of the car, on February  to arrange an inspection.

Gracie Adams is in her first year of psychology at the University of Lincoln, and has already benefited from rent payments, dresses and food shopping after signing up to sugar dating site, Seeking Arrangements. Yet whilst -year-old Gracie from Belfast could be living a luxurious lestyle, sheaposs instead chosen to use her sugar dating to help with her £k student debt. Gracie usually is treated to a dinner - of which she requests a minimum of £, excluding drinks - which can result in the date itself exceeding £. Sugar daddies usually request an outfit for her to purchase ahead of the date, which is on average a further £, and most times Gracieaposs dates will leave her an additional tip - in the region of £. Juggling studying, social le and being a sugar baby, Gracie aims for at least one date a month, in order to pay her bills. Gracie said: I first signed up to Seeking Arrangements when I was nearly  and wasnapost thinking of seriously committing to the sugar baby le. But when I was finishing sixth form and moving to university, I found that loads of women at university had signed up and had very positive experiences.  It helped them get through student le, keep up with rent payments and have cars at university. Using Seeking Arrangements helped me become more confident in talking to men online and what to look out for, as you can have some men lying about themselves and what they do, which is my biggest precaution and worry. Yet despite Gracieaposs worries, she has gone on to have five sugar daddies, seeing at least three of them regularly after their first meet. But Gracie insists that all her relationships are platonic, and has been sure to been completely open with both her family and boyfriend about her sugar relationships. Gracie added: I asked my boyfriend for his opinion andhe would be okayI started being more serious about it.  He wanted to know what Iaposd be doing with the sugar daddies, in terms of dates, and messaging etc. I told him that I would only be interested in starting platonic relationships and mentorships. He understood that I was struggling with money and is very supportive of me and the relationships I build on Seeking Arrangements. My family and I are very open and loving, so I was able to tell them about how I stay on top of things financially, while at university without having to worry about any judgments from my family. When I first told them they took the news with humour and told me to aposcrack onapos, but of course they can sometimes worry about my safety online. Yet despite expressing caution and only taking part in platonic dates, Gracie can rake in over £ per date, including gts of new dresses and shoes.

Callie Colwick, , suffered from a rare condition called placenta accreta while pregnant with her son Quinn. The serious complication occurs when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall after delivery and causes severe blood loss. She tragically lost her newborn son and contracted sepsis which left her fighting for her le as her organs failed. Doctors had no choice but to amputate both of Callie’s legs, her left thumb and forefinger and remove her uterus as the tissue had ‘died’ due to the loss of blood. The graphic designer, from McKinney, Texas, said: “My limbs started to die. “My legs were black and shriveled up, my toes looked like raisins.” When Callie finally ed home after spending over a year in the ICU, her health insurance refused to cover the , custom wheelchair she needed to move around freely. The mother of Kenzi, four, couldn’t push herself around in a standard wheelchair and was forced to wear nappies as she wasn’t able to go to the bathroom alone. Callie was astounded to receive an Instagram message on December   from a kindhearted stranger offering to raise the funds to buy her the special wheelchair. Amy Bernhard, , set up a GoFundMe campaign and within just one day she had raised a staggering , for Callie’s chair with the extra money going towards installing ramps in her home. Callie and husband Kevin, , a web developer, were delighted to discover that Callie was pregnant with Quinn, their second child, in November .  But when Callie began experiencing heavy bleeding at work when she was  weeks pregnant, she went to hospital. “I’d had light bleeding from day one,” Callie said. “But what made me go to the doctor was the heavy abdominal bleeding. “I was passing blood clots. “I was at work about to go into a meeting and I felt this gush of liquid - my pants were soaked in blood. “I went straight to hospital and called Kevin.”  Doctors told Callie that Quinn could be born at any time and that tragically he would not survive the birth. “They put me in the pregnancy wing. “Here we were in this room, surrounded by women giving birth and babies crying and we were told that Quinn had no chance of survival and we were just waiting to give birth to him. “It was a solemn few weeks.” Callie lay in the Trandelenberg Position with her feet elevated above her head in a last ditch attempt to help her baby survive. “I hung like a bat trying to keep him inside through gravity,” she said. “I was afraid of sneezing or going to the restroom in case my waters broke and he was born. “It was a terrying few weeks with nothing to do in the hospital but just wait.” Doctors induced labour on December   and little Quinn was stillborn, weighing just half a pound. “I was fading in and out of consciousness,” Callie said. “I wasn’t responsive, my eyes would roll to the back of my head and I was burning up. “My fever had spiked way too high and they were packing ice onto me. “They broke my waters and he was born. “Quinn was too tiny to survive he went straight to heaven. “My husband was stuck between mourning the loss of his son and making all these medical decisions.” During the delivery Callie lost so much blood that a trauma doctor was flown in from Dallas. “My uterus was hemorrhaging blood. “Doctors were pumping blood into me as soon as it was flowing out.”But Callie developed septic shock in her uterus and the infection soon spread leaving doctors no choice but to remove her uterus. She said: “My world went black. “That infection overrode my entire body. “They had to take out my uterus. “The sepsis shut down my kidneys and my lungs so I was on a breathing machine.” Two months later, doctors decided that they would have to amputate Callie’s legs below the knee and part of her left hand as the tissue was so damaged due to lack of blood. “I remember coming to, in extreme pain and confusion. “My husband had to explain what happened. “I had everything minus my uterus and my feet.”  Callie spent more than a year in the ICU and finally in March  she was able tohome. She had been refused prosthetics by her health insurance and struggled to adjust to le as an amputee in a bulky wheelchair that she could not push herself in. “The wheelchair they sent me home in was a basic chair off of Amazon. “Kevin had to dress my wounds every day.” Callie was finally able to stand on her knees for the first time on January  . “Until then, Kevin had been picking me up and putting me in my chair.” In April  she was finally approved for prosthetics and she applied for a custom chair in October. “My doctor put in the order and they denied my chair. “It is just insane. “I don’t have feet and I can’t put my prosthetics on by myself.”  She shared her frustration on Instagram where Amy, a business coach, from Lafayette, Louisiana, came across her story. “I glanced at Callie’s page and as I watched her videos, I had tears come down my face,” Amy said. “I had trouble sleeping because I could not stop thinking about what this woman had gone through.” She reached out to Callie and offered to start a GoFundMe campaign for her chair, but Callie at first turned down the offer. Callie explained: “I messaged her back and said: ‘No thanks’. “I was still hoping that my insurance would approve it. “But she just kept messaging me and then when my request was declined again for the chair, I agreed. “I said: ‘Yes, do what you think is best’.”  The next morning Amy launched the fundraising campaign and Callie was amazed to see how quickly people donated. “It was shared like wild fire,” she said. “This generous gt from a complete stranger gives me the ability to make my home completely accessible. “It’s a lightweight custom built chair so I can pick it up by myself. “I can actually wheel myself around in it. “Imagine being trapped in a chair - for me, this chair is the dference between a chair that has wheels and one that doesn’t.” The two women met in person for the first time on January  when Amy flew to Dallas for work. They bonded over a sushi dinner where Callie told Amy just how big a dference the baby pink chair had made to her le. “She shared with me what that wheelchair would actually do for her,” Amy said.

Writing on the Hinch Army Cleaning Tips Facebook group, which has more than , members, she said: Seen quite a few opinions on the loo brush... thought I’d share my solution.The brush is required to get the skids off my aposcomfort heightapos toiletI use the brush then clean it and spray with mould  mildew. It stays there until it’s dry then goes back in the holder. No moisture to let the germs fester! She also included a photo to illustrate the unusual method, with the handle of the newly-cleaned toilet brush trapped in the toilet seat, holding the bristles over the toilet so it can drip-dry before being placed back in its holder. Some loved the idea, with one replying: This is genius! Iaposm going to start doing this. Another already used the technique, writing: I thought I was the only strange person that done this. Woohoo I’m not! A third said: This is genius! Iaposm going to start doing this. One wasnapost sure how well it would work in their house, joking: I can see myself trying this and then my husband coming in not paying attention and peeing on it. Others were less convinced about it all, saying: Slightly weird in my honest opinion. Just get the job done, replace the brush and get the hell outta there!!Some steer clear of toilet brushes altogether, as one recalled: I haven’t used a loo brush since my now  year old son was a toddler and was running round the house using it as a sword. Another suggested: I don’t have one. The thought of my children touching it scares me. I’ve always just put bleach down the toilet after going. Does the job and my toilet is lovely and white.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThis is the face of a suspected far-right extremist who allegedly slaughtered ten people - many of them of an immigrant background - in attacks now being treated as terrorism. Nine of the victims - including some of Kurdish descent - were shot dead inside or near two shisha bars in the German town of Hanau, just east of Frankfurt, at about pm on Wednesday. The -year-old suspect - named by German media as Tobias R - left a -page letter and video in which he confessed to the killings and expressed a far-right motive for the massacre. A manhunt for the gunman ended when police found the bodies of the suspect and his -year-old mother inside his flat nearby. Both had been shot. Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror. It is suspected that the gunman fled the scene of the last shisha bar shooting in a car - in which ammunition was found - and took his own le. It was unclear when his mother was killed. Tobias, a German citizen, posted a number of videos on social media in the days before the massacre, including one clip where he ranted about a bizarre conspiracy theory in fluent English, and another where he spoke out against migrants. A neighbour told Focus Online that Tobias seemed completely inconspicuous and normal. It is reported that he was not known to police for extremism. Speaking on Thursday morning, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said racism is poison and the shootings were likely linked to right-ring extremism.Peter Beuth, the interior minister of the state of Hesse, said there was a xenophobic motive to the rampage. He said investigations were ongoing as to whether there were any letters of confession, which was earlier reported by the newspaper Bild. Mr Beuth said the suspect was in legal possession of guns and was a licensed sports marksman. A report by Der Spiegel said Tobias owned several handguns.  Some of the victims were of Kurdish descent, reported Bild, the biggest selling daily newspaper in Germany, while Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for the Turkish presidency, said some of those killed were of Turkish origin. He wrote on Twitter: We expect German authorities to show maximum effort to enlighten this case. Racisim is a collective cancer. Five people were killed at the Arena shisha bar and three were killed at a bar called Midnight.

The two women, who now live in London, were forced to keep their relationship a secret in their home country - where under sharia law, same-sex relationships can be punishable by death. Now free to love each other, they gave a moving interview to the Arabic-language TV show aposJaafar Talkapos which airs on the DW channel, during a Valentineaposs Day special. Using aposFadapos and aposNanzapos as aliases, as the segment includes images of the pair in Saudi Arabia, they revealed how they fell in love after meeting on Snapchat. They managed to keep their relationship a secret until Nanz, who says she discovered her sexuality in her early teens, began to attract suspicion from relatives because she kept knocking back potential suitors. The couple left Saudi Arabia when travel restrictions for women were lted in August  and were granted asylum in the UK. During the interview they opened up about what it is like to be dferent in a country where, according to Saudi Arabiaaposs security agency, homosexual relations can be punishable by death.  When they finally did open up about their relationship on social media upon reaching safety, Nanzaposs relatives promptly cut off all ties with her. But the happy couple are said to be adapting well to their new surroundings and freedom to love each other without fear of death.

We still wanted to implement our style of game but it just wasn’t to be on the night.“We still tried to find an opening but we were just lacking a little bit in the final third.”One way in which playing for United is dferent than being at Hamilton, though, is the weight of expectation.More accustomed to fighting at the bottom end of the table, Bingham believes battling for the Championship title is a dferent challenge but that it requires similar qualities.Recent slump in form is no huge cause for concern for league leaders Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp united-need-not-fret-over-worst-form-of-season embed # secretStwoJgp\" data-secret\"StwoJgp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“It’s a little bit dferent compared to trying to stay up, it’s a dferent kind of mindset you need.“In terms of winning, you still need a mindset to be consistent and there’s a reason why we’re up there and first by  points because we’ve been consistent throughout the season.“We can’t drop that standard evenwe’re playing teams near the bottom, it doesn’t really matter, you still need to be on top of your game. vw, px\"  “It’s a great bunch of lads so we’re just going to keep digging and driving to get that promotion.”The Terrors’ focus now turns to Friday’s visit of Inverness to Tannadice and Bingham is ready to go.“It’s a big club and I was pleased to see the turnout from the away fans on Friday.

win on their way to the Championship title in  thanks to a Ryan Conroy penalty – stretching back over the last decade.However, even from the last meeting in September, there could be considerable changes to the way James McPake sets his side out as he plots a way to double that win rate.The clash on a Friday night on TV saw Jordan McGhee net his first goal for the Dark Blues with a fine header after Queens striker Jack Hamilton had beaten his namesake in the Dundee goal early on.That was a disappointing night for the Dens gaffer as his side struggled to find their feet in the Championship.And he’ll be hoping this version of the Dark Blues can show there’s been some good work done in the time since.After another poor spell at the start of the year, Dundee have put together two positive displays to earn a point at Mortonand win convincingly at home to Partick Thistle last time out.Should boss James decide to stick with the same line-up and -- formation, there will only be four names remaining on the team sheet from the autumn.Of the team that saw off the Jags last time out, only Jordon Forster, Declan McDaid, Graham Dorrans and Kane Hemmings featured in the last trip down to Dumfries.McGhee grabbed the goal that day but he and Cammy Kerr are both recovering from surgery and Saturday may come too soon for them.And with the three-man defence working so well with Christophe Berra added in against Thistle, the Dens gaffer might be tempted to stick rather than twist.That’s likely to see Josh Meekings retain his place also with McDaid filling in at left wing-back and Christie Elliott on the right.Of the midfield three, Dorrans is a stick-on to start, barring any injury problems, while Shaun Byrne has been impressing in training in recent weeks and showed up well against the Jags.The big decision for James is who to put in the place of Ross Callachan.The on-loan midfielder had injected dynamism to the middle of the park and was unlike anything  in the squad.That could see Paul McGowan drop back to a deeper role after stepping in as a makesht striker last week.And Callachan’s energy could be replaced by fit-again Andrew Nelson after he ed from surgery to his hand for the closing stages last time out.Another certainty, barring injury, is Kane Hemmings as he targets moving his goal tally into double figures for the season. vw, px\"  The Doonhamers will have a dferent look about them as well with three key players having left in the winter window.On-loan goalie Robby McCrorie was recalled by Rangers to then send him out to Livingston and that saw the Lions send Ross Stewart Queens way.| https:t.co htWpFhTvHmdash Queen of the SouthJanuary , Centre-back Darren Brownlie made the switch to Partick while creator Faissal El Bakhtaoui headed off to Morocco.Dundee’s recent record on astroturf makes pleasant reading.They are unbeaten in the last five on the surface, winning three times – -

in their own building on Saturday night and collected two crucial points in their play-off push.That key win has put Dundee back within a point of Glasgow Clan and Manchester Storm, who still occupy the seventh and eighth play-off places.Speaking after his side’s big win over Sheffield, Stars head coach Omar Pacha said: “I am really happy for them, the boys were dialled in from the drop of the puck after a great week of practice.“The first five minutes, I think that is the best start we have had all year and I thought we were unlucky not to get something a bit earlier in that period.“But as the game went on we built a bit of confidence in our game and we got the scoring we needed at crucial times with powerplay goals.“The big shorthanded goal was probably the big dference.”Stars put Steelers keeper, Tomas Duba, under pressure after just seconds of play but no early goals were given up by the home side.However, Aaron Fox’s men were handed the first powerplay when Dundee’s Matt Carter was punished for a hooking foul in the sixth minute.That allowed Marc-Olivier Vallerand to fire Sheffield into the lead.The next scoring opportunity fell to the Steelers’ Tanner Eberle, as he created his own breakaway but Stars goalie, Alex Leclerc, stood up to the challenge.Pacha’s men tied the game up on  minutes as captain Matt Marquardt beat Duba low to his right.In the second period, Stars came out with a good tempo and quickly got themselves ahead as Egils Kalns turned Jordan Cownie’s pass in after  minutes.Dundee then had to defend for a period of time as Sheffield came looking for an equaliser but the Scottish side survived the waves of attack before doubling their lead.The Stars were a man down as Jagger Dirk was in the sin bin for slashing but Dufour and Beauregard combined inside the th minute to make it -, as Beauregard deflected the puck past Duba.There had been a physical aspect to the match all night and, after a clean hit by Dundee blueliner Shawn Boutin on Brendan Connolly, the Steelers centerman retaliated with a late one after the whistle on Boutin to earn a two-minute roughing minor.Stars then went on the powerplay in the th minute and just five seconds into their man advantage, Carter tapped in the rebound for the Tayside team’s fourth of the night.The visitors started and ended the middle period on a high but they needed a big third period to fend off a comeback from the league leaders.Fox’s side looked like they would maybe get something but Dundee scrambled the danger clear before going back on the powerplay, as a flurry of fouls meant Sheffield would go down to three skaters.Colton Kroeker finished off Carter’s square pass on  minutes to put Stars - in front.Anthony DeLuca did win a penalty shot in the th minute but his effort went wide of the target.Troncinsky pulled one back for the Yorkshire outfit to reduce the deficit to - inside the final two minutes but that would be the final score.With a win in their only game of the weekend, the Stars now have a week to prepare for their next game against their arch enemies Fe Flyers at the Dundee Ice Arena next Saturday."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e469273da7011.46985477-scaled.jpg ","title":"head coach at lochee amateurs boxing club says young pair can go down same path as rising star sam hickey","story":"Lochee Amateur Boxing Club’s Jerry Howett believes two of his brightest talents can follow in the footsteps of rising star Sam Hickey.Head coach Howett has high hopes for his son Brendan and Luca Flynn and thinks they have just as much potential as former Lochee ABC boxer Hickey – now training with Team Scotland in Glasgow.Both have enjoyed winning starts to the year with Howettearning gold at the Northern District Open Championships  days ago.  Flynnregistered a silver at the same event, following up from his gold at the Scottish Intermediate Championships.And Howett, who comes from a boxing family entrenched in the Lochee community, is delighted with how the pair are progressing.He said: “Luca did well to win at the intermediate Scottish Championships. He had to fight three times, beating last year’s Scottish champion in the semis.“He lost to him in the final of the Northern District Championships but a silver from that is still very good.“He was a bit disappointed but that’s the way it goes sometimes.“Brendan did really well to win the Northern District. He had to fight twice against a couple of tough boys.”Howett feels all his young stars can aspire to reach the heights of former Lochee greats Billy Buchanan, Ronnie Clark and Mike Towell.“Luca used to do gymnastics, which was a bit of a help when he first came but he’s took to the movement in boxing really well.“We’ve got high hopes for him going forward. He could win the Scottish Open Championships at the end of the month.“Luca’s dedication is good and Brendan will get up in the morning to go running and look after his diet.“Brendan’s in for the Senior Open Championships in March, which is a big one because it counts towards being picked for the Commonwealth Games squad in .“He went last year and did well in his first season as a senior so he’s hoping to go one better.“We’ve had Sam, who’s full-time with Boxing Scotland and has went on to earn European medals and win the British Championships, so he’s progressing well.“It’s good to see them taking their chances and there’s more talent to come – Ali Mahmood, Logan Howett and Lennon Mitchell for example. vw, px\"  “Sam is travelling all over now. He’s had assessments with the British squad as well but not quite got in there. Even young Luca is working his way through the Boxing Scotland system. He’s one for the future.”It can be stressful but Howett believes the rewards are worth it.“The building wasn’t getting used for a while but we got it back up and running again with our boxing section. It’s a good place for the kids to come up and get involved, you try to give everyone a chance.“We had a young boy who came up with really severe autism, he was just  and came up on his own but he’s was here for a couple of years now and it helped him loads.“Sometimes I felt like walking away because it’s tough and a big commitment but I love it too much.“It started up again with my brother Andy and I running it, travelling all over Scotland and the UK to tournaments just to get the boys fights. We’ve got a lot of help now from coaches like Jamie Downie, Sean Reilly and Scott Cunningham.

Chris Burke cross from the right was headed up in the air and when it dropped El Makrini pounced with an acrobatic volleyed finish that deceived Lewis.McInnes went for it in the second half as he made a three subs at half-time.Shay Logan, Dean Campbell and Sam Cosgrove were sent on for Bryson, Dylan McGeouch and Connor McLennan.Despite the alterations it was Killie who had the first decent second half chance when Gary Dicker played in Brophy in the rd minute, but Lewis did well to block the left-footed strike.The Dons did respond with Logan teeing up Niall McGinn at the edge of the box, but he bent an effort narrowly wide.With  minutes left Brophy passed up a good chance to put the opportunity beyond doubt arrowing a shot wide after O#Donnell#s surge down the right, and they were made to pay a minute from the end of normal time as Considine#s glancing header from Niall McGinn#s right wing free-kick found the bottom left corner.The Reds could have won the game in stoppage time when Cosgrove headed Logan#s cross from the right flank against the top of the bar.But two minutes into extra-time the Dons did have the lead. Main burrowed his way clear down the right and while Laurentiu Branescu blocked his strike from the narrowest of angles Kennedy was on hand to head home the rebound.Unfortunately the lead was to last only six minutes as Brophy#s superb free-kick into the bottom left corner from  yards made it -.And it looked like it would be heartbreak for Aberdeen with three minutes of extra time left.O#Donnell beat Campbell down the right and Mikey Devlin#s attempt to clear the cross hit Lewis and rebounded out for Kabamba to make it - from close range.What followed was a miraculous smash and grab from the Dons to reach the quarter-finals.In the th minute Stuart Findlay wiped out Ferguson in the box and after Nick Walsh gave the penalty Cosgrove finished from  yards.And in the final minute Considine#s driven cross from the left was turned into his own net by Killie sub Connor Johnson.Kilmarnock: Laurentiu Branescu, Stephen O’Donnell, Stuart Findlay, Kirk Broadfoot, Niko Hamalainen, Alan Power, Gary Dicker, Mohamed El Makrini, Chris Burke , Nicke Kabamba, Eamonn Brophy .Subs not used: Jan Koprivec, Greg Kiltie, Dario Del Fabro, Alistair Taylor, Kyle Connell.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Ash Taylor , Scott McKenna, Andy Considine, Connor McLennan , Lewis Ferguson, Craig Bryson , Dylan McGeouch , Matty Kennedy, Niall McGinn, Curtis Main.Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Ryan Hedges, Bruce Anderson."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road .

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"acha holds annual tenants and members conference","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArgyll Community Housing Associationheld its annual tenants and members conference in Inveraray.Themes covered at the conference focused on three areas # involving young people, improving performance and investing in your home.The session on involving young people included presentations from Iona MacDonald and Hannah Nicolson, trainees with ACHA and Argyll and Bute Council respectively.

think this is one of the most important and signicant political trials of this generation, in fact longer.ldquoI think itrsquos the Dreyfus case of our age.ldquoThe way in which a person is being

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times.

Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable.

What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age.

In the first, a Panorama investigation, Amazon: What They Know About Us, the tech titan and his company were judged by some observers to be data vultures feeding off customersrsquo information, their activities posing a threat to democracy and freedom. One retailer, who alleged his small business was ruined after getting involved with Amazon, even compared the firm to the devil. We saw also a high street bookseller, in tears, locking up her shop for the last time. She could not compete on prices and speed of delivery, so the shop had to close.But then there was the other Jeff Bezos, the one who gave  billionof his fortune to the fight against climate change.

Just when you were wondering what you had in common with someone worth  billion, along comes the answer.So which one is the real Jeff Bezos, a superhero out to save the planet with dollars instead of special powers, or the Jeff Bezos whose company is deemed a threat to democracy and freedom Questioning the motives of those extremely wealthy iniduals who give to charity has become commonplace. While praising Andrew Carnegie for giving fortunes away to help and educate others, we nevertheless remember that he made his money through the blood and sweat of workers, as did every capitalist of his age. Many are the universities who have accepted legacies, only to be taken to task generations later by students questioning the morality of how the money was made.In Bezosrsquos case, customers have come to look anew at Amazon, and the rest of the big tech companies, and wonder what has been invented on our watch.: Licence fee outdatedYet in most cases the customer willingly gave over the information they now deem so precious. Who put all those personal details into Facebook  Who has ever read the terms and conditions or privacy policy  How many of us have bought an Alexa smart speaker and speak to it more often than we do aged relatives or other members of the family Alexa is a perfect example of our love suspect relationship with technology and, by extension, those who have made vast fortunes from it. In January it was reported that sales of Alexa-enabled devices had passed the  million mark. Though Amazon did not break the total down into its speakers and other products, the extent of the tech revolution that has taken place in our homes is breathtaking.I remember when smart speakers first appeared. There was no end to what you could ask Alexa to do, from order dog food to play your favourite music and find out what the time and temperature was anywhere in the world.How clever we thought we were, how much time we could save. Then the whispers and doubts began. Sure enough, it wasnrsquot just the machines listening. Humans were doing it as well.Big tech said only a tiny fraction of conversations were monitored, and that it was only done to improve the service, but customers were unnerved and rightly so.: Amazon target site for wind farm plansThe biggest joke of all was that people had paid for the devices they now accused of infringing their privacy. One former Amazon executive interviewed by Panorama said he still had Alexas in his home but he turned them offhe wanted to have a private conversation. I expect after watching the programme that many more will do the same.There is a backlash building against Big Tech, with the race on to see how governments can tax and regulate them better.If one was cynical, Mr Bezosrsquos setting up of a  billion fund, like Mark Zuckerbergrsquos call this week for greater regulation, can be seen as the tech titans once again trying to stay ahead of the curve.Doing good things, saying the right things, to reframe the debate in their favour tinkering at the edges when what they really should be doing is paying more tax, assuming greater responsibility for their actions, and reducing their own carbon footprint. Anyway, how much dference can  billion make given the size of the problem faced The Amazon chief executive is not the only fantastically rich person having his actions questioned. Mike Bloomberg, whose charitable giving down the years makes the odd billion here and there look positively peanut-sized, is feeling the heat too, with a rival for the Democratic nomination, Elizabeth Warren, calling him an ldquoegomaniac billionaire and saying it was a ldquoshame he was able to ldquobuy his way into the debate.It is right to be cautious about where vast wealth comes from and what it is used for, but at the same time we should give credit where it is due.

It’s always very interesting when we get an unusual request like this, and we’re delighted to be able to help restore a building of such signicant historical interest.”The building slowly fell into a state of decline and in  was declared unsafe by the fire department.Two years later it was bought by a developer and the major refurbishment will see the building reopen its doors as a plush hotel, with retail space and a number of private apartments.The pillars have been produced, polished and finished at Fyfe Glenrock’s base in Oldmeldrum and are now being shipped to the USA where, said Mr Collinson, they will not look out of place.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Respitality support worker Ann Brodie alongside colleagues from Energie Fitness\"  ‘Respitality’ links to support carers viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amThis week#s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

He also asked for an update on the progress of current candidate mast locations in Burray, Hoy and Stromness.In response, Paul Wheelhouse, minister for connectivity and the islands, stated that no new proposed mast locations have been introduced since April  and — despite regular engagement with mobile operators — no operator has committed to using any of the candidate mast locations.Last July, Mr McArthur wrote to mobile phone operators urging them to engage constructively with the programme in Orkney.The MSP said: “It is disappointing to see that progress in closing gaps in mobile phone coverage across Orkney appears to have stalled.“While the Minister has provided assurances that discussions with mobile phone companies are ongoing, there is no sign they are prepared to engage seriously.  Sites have been identied in Stromness, Hoy and Burray, yet people and businesses in these communities are missing out on the better mobile coverage that should be available.“Meantime, efforts to identy new sites appear to have come to a complete halt. That is not good enough.“Ministers and mobile phone operators clearly agreed that public money was needed to plug existing gaps in the network. Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website.

should not be extradited to the US because it would ldquodamage the democratic standing of the UK, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said.The Labour politician on Thursday visited Assange for two hours at Belmarsh prison in southeast London, where the Australian is awaiting the start of an extradition hearing next week.Speaking to the press afterwards by the prison gates, Mr McDonnell said: ldquoI think this is one of the most important and signicant political trials of this generation, in fact longer.ldquoI think itrsquos the Dreyfus case of our age.ldquoThe way in which a person is being persecuted for political reasons, for simply exposing the truth for what went on in relation to recent wars. vw,vw,px, px\"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in a prison van Mr McDonnell was referring to the  conviction at a court martial of French officer Alfred Dreyfus on treason charges many felt were brought against him because he was Jewish.He was later exonerated after a long campaign featuring intellectuals such as novelist Emile Zola who wrote a denunciation of the prosecution case entitled JrsquoAccuse .Mr McDonnell said: ldquoWersquore hoping that in court heis able to defeat the extradition bid.ldquoWe donrsquot believe that extradition should be used for political purposes.Assange, , is wanted in the US to face  charges, including conspiring to commit computer intrusion, over the publication of US cables a decade ago.If found guilty he could face up to  years in jail. vw,vw,px, px\"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell outside HMP Belmarsh He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Cha Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classied documents.Mr McDonnell said Assangersquos health had been affected by his imprisonment but said he appeared ldquostrong and ldquodetermined to fight his extradition.ldquoThis is all about the protection of sources, whistleblowing, ensuring that people have true information in the public domain on which they can make they own judgments, Mr McDonnell said.He added: ldquoI thinkthis extradition takes place it will damage the democratic standing of our own country as well as America.ldquoWe have a long tradition in this country of standing up for journalistic freedom, standing up for the protection of whistleblowers and those who expose injustices.Mr McDonnell said he felt ldquoanxious over the ldquobarbaric treatment Assange has experienced in prison, where he said he spends  hours a day in his cell.ldquoI hoping that the hearings in the coming months will secure his freedom, there is no need for him to be locked up in a place like Belmarsh, he said.On Tuesday it emerged that fellow inmates at the high-security Belmarsh successfully lobbied for Assangersquos release from solitary confinement.Tweets by CommissionerHRAssangersquos legal team have claimed his health has deteriorated in recent years as he sought to avoid extradition.Assangersquos father John Shipton said his sonrsquos condition has improved, but saidhe was extradited it would be akin to a ldquodeath sentence.ldquoIt demonstrates, I think, the political nature of the trial itself, Mr McDonnell said.He suggested there are ldquodeeply held doubts in Parliament and Government over Assangersquos case.He said he did not know the views of Labour leadership candidates, but added: ldquoFrom my point of view, Irsquom hoping that the Labour Party overall will oppose this extradition.He said he wanted to see cross-party support for Assange in Parliament.Mr McDonnell also urged people to join peaceful demonstrations in support of Assange outside the court when the hearings start.The Council of Europe, of which the UK is a member state, said granting the extradition would have human rights implications ldquothat reach far beyond his inidual case and would have a ldquochilling effect of media freedom.Its human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatovic, said: ldquoIn view of both the press freedom implications and the serious concerns over the treatment Julian Assange would be subjected to in the United States, my assessment as Commissioner for Human Rights is that he should not be extradited.The hearing is due to begin at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday, beginning with a week of legal argument. vw,vw,px, px\"The White House denied claims Donald Trump had offered Assange a conditional pardon At a court hearing on Wednesday it emerged US President Donald Trump allegedly offered Assange a pardonhe said Russia was not involved in the leak of Democratic National Committee emails.A series of emails embarrassing for the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign were hacked before being published by WikiLeaks in .The White House denied the allegation.Assange has been held on remand in Belmarsh since last September after serving a -week jail sentence for breaching his bail conditions while he was in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.He entered the building in  to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex offence allegations, which he has always denied and were subsequently dropped.copy -.

There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out.

Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before.

This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that.

There is much more ‘going ons’ than merely learning lines and ‘tech’ work as the -strong cast fill the stage and raise the roof with their storming ‘Another Op’nin, Another Show’ number.

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland education sector needs 15bn in next","story":"Gary Fair  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGary Fair By Mark BainFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailEducation officials have warned that they will require an extra £m in   to meet the sector#s financial needs.However, a three-year projection by the Department of Education sees the demand rise to £m in   - and to £m a year later.The department#s finance director Gary Fair outlined the requirement for the extra cash injection into the ailing system during yesterday#s meeting of the education committee at Stormont.Read MoreOpinionDr Esmond Birnie: Cash-strapped Executive facing some very tough choices on revenue-raisingThe education budget is already one of Stormont#s biggest at about £bn a year, but after years of growing pressures across the system, an increase in funds is needed to address a mounting crisis.The pressure on the sector has increased across a range of areas, Mr Fair told MLAs on the committee.The increase is needed to pay for things like a teachers# pay settlement, increasing special educational needs support costs and essential maintenance work, he said.Many schools had signicant maintenance problems, Mr Fair explained.All we#ve been able to do is fund the minimum, the real things that might hit the crisis point in terms of health and safety, he said.The reality is there#s a lot of work required across the education estate.An extra £m is required to meet increased special educational needs for pupil support in mainstream schools, special schools and transport.Mr Fair said that the department was also bidding for £m for a voluntary exit scheme to allow around  teachers and an unspecied number of classroom assistants to leave their jobs early in a bid to oxygenate the system.Alliance MLA and committee chairman Chris Lyttle asked Mr Fair how realistic the request for extra funding was.Mr Fair warned that cuts to frontline services would have to be consideredsignicant money was not provided.Iniably, you#re having to make people redundant and stop critical services that are having a signicant impact on the educational welfare of children and young people, he said.If we don#t get a signicant proportion of what we#re seeking here, we#ll be in this position again. That#s the reality.Mr Fair also said extra funding would be needed to meet additional commitments agreed in the New Decade, New Approachdeal, which restored devolved government at Stormont in January.However, he noted that it was up to the Executive to decide which aspects should be taken forward and when.There#s obviously discussions going on in terms of some of the detail within the NDNA agreement and whether that can be taken forward in the short term or perhaps longer term, he said.A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: The Department estimates that additional funding of around £m would be required in - to meet statutory and contractual commitments, develop and implement new strategies frameworks and address education specic commitments set out in the New Decade, New Approach agreement.

But he was also to be admired for the highest values and standards he lived by.Harry could be forthright and direct, as many have acknowledged in the tributes to him. He didn#t suffer fools gladly. But he also had a warm and gentle side.I treasured his friendship and his company.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBishop Tony Farquhar FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBishop Tony FarquharBishop Tony, a well-known and hugely respected figure in Northern Ireland football at all levels, has been a regular attender at Windsor Park internationals since the s when Gregg#s career began.I was captivated by his fearless goalkeeping style, he said. One of my earliest memories of him is in the infamous Battle of Belfast against Italy in  which turned into a free-for-all between the teams. No one who was there could forget it.I was fortunate in later le to get to know Harry at the Milk Cup, which he helped establish, on his native North Coast.We became friends and one of the nicest Christmas presents I have ever received was a copy of his autobiography, which he arranged to sign for me one day at his house at Articlave, near Castlerock.I was there for over two hours before he produced a pen. We talked and talked about football in particular and le in general. He was an incredibly learned and interesting man. I noticed a framed schoolboy international jersey had pride of place over his Manchester United and senior Northern Ireland shirts and always remember him explaining thatit hadn#t been for that first jersey, there wouldn#t have been any more.Dundee United-supporting Bishop Tony#s own football roots are in the universities game, being closely associated with Queen#s and the University of Ulster at Coleraine. He has travelled the world watching football and at the World Cup in Italy in  was famously instrumental in arranging for the competing Republic of Ireland team an audience with the Pope at The Vatican.The bond between the Catholic Bishop and the Coleraine Protestant is not as unlikely as it may have seemed.Gregg was ambivalent when it came to creeds. A regular churchgoer when he left Coleraine to begin his career in England, he once explained: I attended church on a Sunday everywhere I travelled with United and Northern Ireland. If I couldn#t find one of my own Protestant faith, I attended a Catholic service, because to me a church is a church.Belfast Related ContentCommentOpinionJim Gracey:Passionate, entertaining, meticulous... with Harry Gregg there were no grey areasIt was a sight guaranteed to strike fear into the heart of a young reporter... ing to the office to find a yellow post-it note stuck to your keyboard and bearing a two word summons - #Fone Harry#.FootballOpinionSteven Beacom:As both a goalkeeper and as a human being, legendary Harry Gregg stayed true to himselfHarry Gregg.

Then on Saturday, all day, I#ll be glued to the skies watching for them to come back.I#ve had a few friends come around to see the lofts and I know a lot of them think it#s all a bit strange, but it#s not to me.This has brought the family so close together. My grandad has taught me and my dad everything we know and I#m so happy to spend the time with him around the lofts.There is a bit of in-family rivalry though, with all three members willing their birds to be the first to arrive home.Whoever loses has to make the tea, said Keelie, who will soon have to fit her pigeon routine in around exam revision for her studies at St Ronan#s College in Lurgan.Keelie#s navigations through the highs and lows of the  season will be featured on CBBC on Tuesday, February  .She narrates My Le: My Pigeons and Me, which reveals how her unlikely hobby has strengthened the family bond and allows them to spend many hours together as they look after their birds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKeelie and Aaryan at a pigeon show in Blackpool FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappKeelie and Aaryan at a pigeon show in BlackpoolShe even hands out tips to another young fancier, Aaryanfrom Rochdale.My grandad has been doing this for over  years now.

Ards and North Down Borough Council had said yesterday the local authority would not be flying the flag at its designated site on Church Street in Newtownards because the Duke of York is no longer a working Royal. However, in a statement today a council spokesperson told the Belfastthe decision had been made by council officers in error.The error was corrected mid-morning on  February and our one designated flag is now flying in addition to the seven flags that fly on council properties across the borough throughout the year, the spokesperson added. The Prince is currently dogged by allegations that he slept with Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. he strenuously denies wrongdoing.The allegations against the Queen#s son led to a debate in councils in Northern Ireland on whether it was appropriate to fly the flag on his birthday. People in Belfast and Bangor let us know what they think about the flying of the Union Flag on Prince Andrew#s th birthday.The Belfastspoke to people in Bangor and Belfast about the flying of the flag today.David Moore said it was not worth celebrating Prince Andrew#s birthday.He probably doesn#t really care whether the flag is up himself or not, he said. He has got bigger things to worry about than his flag being flown. Maybe someone conveniently forgot to put it up this morning.Shireen Symington said: I would not be flying it because I think he has let the Royal family down.In Belfast, where the flag was flying at City Hall, Alan Lennon said: “I think it goes deeper than that, it is not flying it for Andrew, it is for the Royal Family which I support very much. I would fly it for Andrew as well.There are allegations going about but nothing has been proven in anyway. I am happy enough for it to be flying today.”Brian Robinson said the flag should be flown as Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom.We are British, we live in the United Kingdom, it is our flag, we should be flying it, he said. Irrespective of anything, it is our country. He has not been charged with anything as far as I am aware.

There are  councils in Northern Ireland, four of which never fly the flag and only Ards and North Down had previously chosen not to fly the flag today. Five councils are flying the Union Flag, some because they fly it everyday and others, like Belfast City Council, because it is still officially a designated day. Causeway Coast and Glens, in a bid to try and reflect the four council areas it was formed from, is flying the flag from some buildings but not others.The Union Flag is also being flown at Stormont.

Then he becomes your partner. I have said, the first thing to be is honest with yourself... As I walked out the door to my freedom, I knewI didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.” Nelson MandelaThirty years ago, Nelson Mandela stepped out the front gate of the Victor Verster Prison in the suburb of Paarl, near Cape Town. As he and then-we Winnie raised their fists in triumph, he began his long walk to freedom through the mid-afternoon sun.Last week marked  years since Mandela’s release after  years in prison. It is one of history’s most iconic moments and arose from an unlikely exchange the previous evening between the ANCleader and South African President FW de Klerk.When de Klerk announced that he was to be released the following day, Mandela took exception and asked for a week’s notice, saying it was much too soon. The South African president was taken aback, but after consultation with his advisers, he reaffirmed that February ,  would be Madiba’s release date.The lting of a ban on the African National Congress , the Pan African Congressand the South African Communist Party along with  other illegal organisations paved the way for what would be a momentous occasion.Alongside the announcement was the proposed release of political prisoners incarcerated for non- violent activities. Mandela would walk free.He described it in his autobiography, The Long Walk to Freedom, saying that: “...in one sweeping action, he had virtually normalised the situation in South Africa.”One of Derry’s most famous sons, Poet Laureate Seamus Heaney, was deeply influenced by the work of Nelson Mandela and, in particular, his release from prison. Madiba’s release came amid a wave of regime change across Europe and Heaney recalled the era in a  interview with Shaun Johnson for The Independent.He said: “The crisis in South Africa, and the miraculum, as I call it – the wondrous change and wondrous intervention of Nelson Mandela – that was a magical moment in the th century.“In , I remember watching as one regime after the other gently came down in Eastern Europe. And the following February, Mandela came out of prison and it was a memory-marking moment for anybody. The world was entranced with South Africa.A fiercely anti-apartheid Seamus Heaney was at Hard University at the time of Mandela’s release and was translating Philoctetes, a play by Sophocles.The concept of having a moral high ground was at its centre and, while working on it, Heaney found himself relating its content to the political liberation reverberating at the turn of the decade.That ‘memory-marking moment’ inspired him to include a chorus of his own in his adaptation The Cure at Troy:“History says, Dont hopeOn this side of the grave,But then, once in a letimeThe longed-for tidal waveOf justice can rise upAnd hope and history rhyme.”Heaney explained his reasoning to Shaun Johnson in , saying: “The play is really about someone who has been wounded and betrayed, and whether he can reintegrate with the betrayers or not. It seemed to me to mesh beautully with Mandelas .”Brian McCormick, manager of the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in the poet’s Co Derry hometown of Bellaghy, explains further.“It was Mandela’s release that prompted him to write that poem, but it has also been used very much in conjunction with what has happened here in the last  years, in relation to the peace process, he said.The final line had its resonance magnied in  when US President Bill Clinton quoted it on his famous visit to Northern Ireland.It was also quoted as recently as a few weeks ago by Democrat Joe Biden as he began campaigning for the US election. Brian believes the piece has real signicance.He said: “That piece has almost taken on a le of its own. Every time someone hears those words, theyrealise the power of them.“Everybody remembers that moment when Bill Clinton quoted those words back about hope and history rhyming and it shows me the universal nature of his words and his poetry.”“Mandela’s story was so inspiration and powerful, and the fact that, after his release, he went on to facilitate the reinvigoration of South Africa makes him such a leading force of reconciliation.“That story provided a bit of the impetus for politicians here and that’s why those words resonated so much.”The two men’s paths never crossed, but Brian is in no doubt that Mandela would have been aware of Heaney and his work. The South African leader was awarded the Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience award in .The award was named after Heaney’s poem The Republic of Conscience and the Nobel Literature Laureate said at the time: “To have the man who made themrhyme accept the Award inspired by my poem is something  again.”In his autobiography, Mandela describes a nagging feeling that permeated the widespread joy of his release.He wrote: “Although I was pleased to have such a reception, I was greatly vexed by the fact that I did not have a chance to say goodbye to the prison staff.”Amid the fanfare and delirium of his release, his regret was not getting a chance to speak to and thank his captors. That level of dignity, humility and forgiveness is something that will never lose its worth.The sentiment embodied by Nelson Mandela and expressed by Seamus Heaney in The Cure at Troy is as relevant today as it was  years ago.Hope, reconciliation and humility, with the latter expressed beautully in the poem whose name adorns the award given to Mandela in .“You carried what you had to and very soon your symptoms of creeping privilege disappeared.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its such a wonderful cause and Lucy really opened my eyes to it.I was nervous when it came to getting it cut, but she couldnt wait and she was all smiles.I took some photos of her getting it done and didnt realise until after that shes winking in one of them.Lucy raised pound through an online sponsorship and the rest was donated by family and friends.Its a great charity and its lovely that Lucy will be helping other children, continued Ms Cruickshank.Its nice to raise awareness that the charity is out there and maybe other girls will want to do the same thing.Id also like to thank Selena Doherty McFeely, of Syenna Hair and Beauty in Pump Street, where she got it cut and Dearbhla Lynch, the hairdresser who cut it for her. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between.

His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Feb   addthis, Louth-based band Kern are itching to add a Derry venue to their CV as they prepare to play the Twilight Music Sessions at Roe Valley Arts  Cultural Centre this weekend.“The list of counties we haven’t played in is getting smaller,” says Brendan McCreanor, who plays uilleann pipes. “We’ve heard great things about the venue and we’re really looking forward to it.” The band take their name from the Irish word ‘caithearn’ - a medieval Irish soldier, but Brendan says they were attracted to the word’s ‘malleability’. He says: “It means lots of things in lots of languages. The nicest one we came across was in German, where it means a core or a seed. “That’s one of the nicer ones, as there’s a core group here of only three of us and the seed grows and keeps changing.” googletag.cmd.push The band has toured extensively over the past year and list winning the  TradFest Temple Bar showcase and performing at America’s largest Irish festival – the Milwaukee Irish Fest – among their achievements, but lead singer and guitarist Stephen McArdle insists their focus has been on the music rather than the accolades. He says: “They do a showcase in conjunction with Milauwakee Irish Fest and we showcased at it last year. It went out on RTEacute radio. We didn’t really think about winning it, we took it because it was a good gig.  The band’s sound is a fusion of the traditional and the original, with their repertoire intrinsically linked to their native County Louth, something Stephen says is vital to the group’s sound: googletag.cmd.push “When we do traditional music, it tends to have a strong ceangalwith the land we’re coming from. That’s what we bring and then we write our own songs along with that.” The mixture of traditional and contemporary is a big hit in modern Irish music, and fiddle player, Barry Kiernan, credits the resurgence of the Fleadh and, in particular, Fleadh TV, for the upsurge: “So many people go to the Fleadh for dferent reasons.

For McEleney though, it is just another game.“I think Im at that point in my le and career where, I wouldnt say I dont get nervous, and butterflies are good, but Im kind of used to it now at this stage,” he explained.“You just go out and do the best you can. Obviously its against Derry and I played with them for five years so I still have a soft spot in my heart for them, but I wont have a soft spot on Friday night because there wont be one for me. Ill be looking forward to it and relishing it.”Harps go into the game on the back of a - win against Sligo Rovers in their opening game, and despite the pitch being labelled as crap by Liam Buckley afterwards, and despite the torrential conditions, McEleney believes the three points went to the right team. “It was one of those wins where you get three points up on the board quickly and you get confidence from it,” he stated.“The boys are delighted. We all gave a good account of ourselves. It was a bad night and the pitch wasnt great but we stuck at it and I think overall in the  minutes we created the better chances in the game. It was a pleasing performance and were off to a good start so were happy enough.”For too long Harps have been in a battle to retain their Premier Division status, and again last season, just did enough to beat the drop by beating Drogheda in the end of season play-off. A number of new signings have given rise to the hope that Harps will do much better this time around, a feeling which was reinforced by last weeks win. McEleney believes it is too early to make judgements.“The thing is we know what its going to take,” he explained. “Every game is going to be a tough game. I think its a tougher league than it was last year. Weve had a decent pre-season. I know results in pre-season dont really mean much but we got a good amount of fitness from it and I think that showed the other night because I think we looked fitter than them over the whole  minutes. Hopefully we can stay a couple of pegs above it, but its going to be tough.“By no means are we saying Were definitely staying up and this, that and the other. Id be lyingI said that, but we are just looking forward to it and well take every game as a cup final which I think will suit us because we have got a good group and a good mentality.” googletag.cmd.push UnusualIt is not often that Harps find themselves higher than their Northwest rivals, but that is one of many fascinating subplots which make this another highly-anticipated derby encounter.“We may as well take it when it comes,” McEleney said. “The boys are looking forward to it on Friday. “We know coming up to the Brandywell that Derry have a good record at home. They did well at home last year so we know its going to be a tough game for us, but its just another game of football and thats the way you have to look at it.“ I know its a derby but after  minutes its all over and done with.“Every game, especially the first games, are always cagey. Its always kind of helter-skelter because teams dont really hit a rhythm until five or six games in. Derry have a relatively new squad as well with a lot of new players, so the more points you can put on the board, regardless of performance, the better it stands to you.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Theres no doubt about that Finn Harps are our biggest rivals. They are in close proximity and our supporters always look forward to these games and we have to treat it like a cup final. “Its an opportunity for us to get up and running because we lost our first game and we have to make sure that were bang at it on Friday because Harps will be coming confident on the back of a really good result also.”City lost five home games last season, and Devine wants to improve on that record, asking his players to make the Brandywell an dficult venue for visiting teams in .“We want to get points on the board as quickly as possible but we know its going to be dficult,” he continued. “Ive never been involved in an easy one against Finn Harps.“ I think every team in the country is going to be finding their feet over the next couple of weeks and thats whats key. Last year we hit the ground running quite well but every team is going to take time to get up to speed. “At the same time we have got to make sure that the Brandywell is a fortress this year and make it somewhere no-one looks forward to coming and playing. “That is exactly our game plan this week, making sure that we are the team on the ascendancy. We are playing at home and we have got to make sure that home advantage counts.” googletag.cmd.push MemorableCity and Harps had some memorable clashes last year, and a packed Brandywell is expected in anticipation of yet another frenetic derby game. “The pleasing thing for us is that were playing on a brilliant surface, in a brilliant stadium, with a big crowd and a lot of people looking forward to seeing us perform,” he added. “Finn Harps are working off a very big budget this year, being able to attract the players that they have so we have to make sure that we are at our very, very best to show our people and our supporters that we mean business this year.”There are several interesting subplots to tomorrows game, with theof former City captain Barry McNamee at the top of the list. Shane McEleney, Sam Todd, Gareth Harkin and former Harps captain Ciaran Coll will also come up against their former teams.“There a lot of ex-players playing but we just have to go about our jobs,” Devine stated. “Im only concerned about the players wearing red and white on Friday and we have got to make sure they do their jobs as best they can. “I have no doubt they will because they have given serious, serious work in pre-season, their fitness levels are very high and our ability to get around the pitch is very high.“I feel this year that we have a lot of goals in our team and Im looking forward to the game. It will be more about what we do. We have to concentrate on ourselves and our own desire to win the game.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

before.Some of the artefacts included medieval pottery, animal bones, bronze pins, an Early Christian cross slab and a bronze section of a medieval cross with settings for precious stones.Wooden

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE

Our aim is to effectively address the childrenrsquos needs and prevent exclusion from the classroom and any distress caused by them not having the coping skills, through no fault of their own.Garry Hanna, chairman of the board of governors, announced that the school will be providing a free-of-charge breakfast club between am and am each morning to working parents who need early morning childcare.He said: ldquoIn order to allow many of our parents greater flexibility with their working arrangements, we will now provide this free service.

Neil Curran was home in ., which was a  second PB for him at this distance. Despite improving on his time, he was non-committal about his performance, feeling that a lack of speed work had left his legs wanting.Runners can be hard on themselves and should remember that performances that they think lack sparkle, may be times that others may only dream of achieving.Jimmyrsquos recceA call had gone out to our members to take part in a recce of the course for the rapidly approaching Jimmyrsquos .It was decided to open this up to all comers and it was a popular move. With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out.

Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple.

He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

It has certainly made waves south of the border, and it would be foolish to imagine they won’t winter with us: that would be a long, hard, winter. I don’t think anyone can predict, with any accuracy, what the long term consequences will be, but one thing for sure, it’s the harbinger of change: the old order, nationalism and unionism, is crumbling. Politics in Ireland, North and South, had become ‘safe’ and jaded, and both sides just continued to play the same old game: two aging tennis players warming up, and gently knocking the ball back and forth over the net, without getting serious: it becomes predictable, and boring.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

At a time when Ireland, morally and spiritually, is going through momentous change, not all for the better, it was inevitable that politics would be affected. Those winds of change are blowing in our direction. The old order has hit dangerous currents, and no-one is safe. The Protestant community, foolishly, has always placed its faith in unionism to survive, but it is on the wane, and we need to be careful it is not in its death throes. If it is, we will have to sht for ourselves. Pulling up the drawbridge is no longer an option, that has been breached and the ‘narrow ground’ flooded. The old order has to engage, or risk going under.The old slogans and symbols don’t cut it. We may yet be in the epi-centre of a revolution, and we need to be careful those winds of change don’t become a tsunami. A community in denial convinced nothing has changed will continue to wear that old threadbare garment of apathy. When it gets to that stage, we have a serious problem.Clive Maxwell,Bleary"},{"url":null,"title":"jonny mccambridge parable parallel parking paranoia ","story":"When do the clocks change  Heres when they go forward in  - and when spring beginsPlan to develop  new homes would close urban gap on outskirts of BallymenaNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleJonny McCambridge: The parable of parallel parking paranoiaThe snow is coming in horizontally, appearing out of the black and attacking my windscreen like thousands of tiny darts. Cecilia is on the wireless issuing a weather warning and my son is in the back seat asking mewe’re going to be late for school.By Jonny McCambridgeWednesday, th February , : am\"\"Parallel parking, easier to spell than executeWe may well be late. If we are it will have been caused by his insistence on wearing his Incredible Hulk pants today, a demand which led to a panicked last minute inventory of damp garments hung on steamy radiators. However, it seems uncharitable to mention that now so instead I just grit my teeth and tighten my grip on the steering wheel.I’ve almost driven past before I notice the gap between two stationary cars. On a dark, snowy morning a parking space near the school is as rare as a newborn with whiskers, so I hurriedly apply the brakes and put on the left indicator.However, as soon as I begin to reverse I feel something is not right, it’s an instinct which tells me that the positioning of the car is not quite as it should be. Perhaps I’m a little bit too far forward, or too far back. Or maybe I don’t turn the steering wheel far enough, or too much. I know from habit it’s wrong but I keep going.I attempt to straighten the vehicle and, to be fair, some of it is in the parking space. Unfortunately more of it is encroaching onto the road and blocking the flow of traffic. I look out the side window, I can see the footpath which I want to park beside. It’s definitely within walking distance. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...So I start trying to get my car closer to that path. I turn the steering wheel one way and reverse a little, then I turn the wheel the other way and go forward. I seem to be further from the pavement now.I try switching the direction that I’m turning the wheel. Now the front of my car mounts the footpath while the rear hangs out towards the middle of the carriageway, asI’m attempting some sort of audacious road-block.My son, in the back seat, is watching me. He is impassive.‘What are you doing daddy ’‘I’m trying to park the car son.’‘But why are you driving on the footpath daddy ’‘It’s all because of your flipping Incredible Hulk pants!’ I answer unconvincingly.Several minutes pass tortuously like this before I concede what has become clear, that I’m going to have to start again. I put on my right indicator and pull again into the busy school run traffic. The other cars stop and wait, growling impatiently while I steady myself, select reverse gear and try once again to execute the parallel park.But there’s an inevitability to my ultimate failure now. I’m flustered and a little embarrassed and my hands seem to have lost their dexterity. Conscious that I was too far out last time I over-compensate with the steering wheel and soon feel the bump as one rear tyre lts onto the footpath.I try to straighten up but, such is my panic, that I’ve lost the ability to distinguish left from right. I jerk wildly at the steering wheel and feel the bump as my second rear tyre mounts the pavement. Now the front of my car is hanging out in the middle of the road, forcing traffic to go round it.And then I just give up. Or to put it another way, my brain decides to close down. I’ve noticed this state of vacillation come over me before in moments of great stress. While my body is still in the car my mind has taken itself off to a sunnier place, a golden meadow where I’m playing with a labrador pup and picking daisies. It’s very enjoyable for a few moments, until a blast of a horn brings me back to reality. I look at my son in the back seat, his angelic features fixed on me.‘Why has your face gone so red daddy ’It’s not the fact that I’m not very good at parallel parking which bothers me, I’ve long ago reconciled myself to that failing. It’s the fact that I’m embarrassing myself in public. Again. I’ve convinced myself that everyone will be talking about me. Again.Back in my days of therapy I used to chat to a lot of counsellors who attempted to help change the way I think. If a brain tends to dwell on the negative then there are techniques which can be used to separate thought from emotion, fact from prejudice, to teach the mind to be less self-critical. Part of this is reminding myself that other people obviously have better things to talk about than my deficiencies.But on this morning, with my car jutting out onto a road at an unnatural angle and causing a traffic jam, it’s a struggle to believe that. Not only have I convinced myself that my pathetic parking will be all of the talk of the village for days, but I also fear that Netflix have already commissioned a  part series on the debacle, with Daniel Day-Lewis talked out of retirement to bring my tortured soul to le on the small screen.There is nothing  to be done but to abandon the parking attempt altogether, to find another space far away where there are fewer cars. Swaziland would be good.And so I drive away. In my rear-view mirror I’m sure I can see a granny parking a giant x in the same space on the first attempt. I drive around the corner and up the hill further away from the school. I park in a quieter spot, away from the constipation of congestion.I turn off the engine and watch some of the other parents rushing with their children towards the school gates. Their faces are strained against the weather and it’s obvious that they don’t notice me in . I relax because I can see things more clearly now. These people are not bothered with my deficiencies at parking or anything . They have their own lives.

More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce.

Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le. Organisations like CALM are the best defence we have against stories that end like Joe’s.”CALM runs a free and confidential helpline and webchat for anyone who needs to talk about le’s problems, available in NI and across the UK.‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ runs until February .\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

She told me that our producer, our director, the whole cast and crew really filled that void for her and made her feel so loved and welcomed. “Watching this series as cast members will be bittersweet, it’ll be a lovely tribute to Julie but also very sad without her.”In episode one of the new series, broadcaster Gerry Kelly confronts Laurence Lyle, played by comedian Shane Todd, over a PR gaffe. In episode two, which airs next Friday, Jackie Fullerton shares his years of experience with Soft Border Patrol officers.Diona said: “It’s such a great concept that The Comedy Unit have developed relative to the times we’re living in.“I don’t know what outcome we would have needed to have had politically for Soft Border Patrol to ever make sense but I don’t think it matters, we’re just having fun with it.“It’s farcical and it’s silly but it’s also scarily to the bone sometimes of how our future could be, and some things that have actually happened have been parodied on the show without us even realising.“People in Northern Ireland are at their best when they’re taking the mickey out of themselves and that is what this show does.“Even with the Nadine Coyle clip last year, that was taking the mick out of her but in the kindest possible way. She was so up for it.”Askedit’s hard to keep a straight face when you don’t know what’s coming next, Diona said: “The stuff we do with Michael Stranney who plays Craig Carson, the leader of the Continuity Nine , has us breaking down and laughing and having to start again. You would have a great blooper reel from the three series.”Series three will extend to four episodes beginning on Friday night on BBC One Northern Ireland at .pm.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

JrsquoAccuse .Mr McDonnell said: ldquoWersquore hoping that in court heis able to defeat the extradition bid.ldquoWe donrsquot believe that extradition should be used for political purposes.Assange, , is wanted in the US to face  charges, including conspiring to commit computer intrusion, over the publication of US cables a decade ago.If found guilty he could face up to  years in jail. vw,vw,px,

said Assangersquos health had been affected by his imprisonment but said he appeared ldquostrong and ldquodetermined to fight his extradition.ldquoThis is all about the protection of sources, whistleblowing, ensuring that people have true information in the public domain on which they can make they own judgments, Mr McDonnell said.He added: ldquoI thinkthis extradition takes place it will damage the democratic standing of our own country as well as America.ldquoWe have a long tradition in this country of standing up for journalistic freedom, standing up for the protection of whistleblowers and those who expose injustices.Mr McDonnell said he felt ldquoanxious over the ldquobarbaric treatment Assange has experienced in prison, where he said he spends  hours a day in his cell.ldquoI hoping that the hearings in the coming months will secure his freedom, there is no need for him to be locked up in a place like Belmarsh, he said.On Tuesday it emerged that fellow inmates at the high-security Belmarsh successfully lobbied for Assangersquos release from solitary confinement.Tweets by CommissionerHRAssangersquos legal team have claimed his health has deteriorated in recent years as he sought to avoid extradition.Assangersquos father John Shipton said his sonrsquos condition has improved, but saidhe was extradited it would be akin to a ldquodeath sentence.ldquoIt demonstrates, I think, the political nature of the trial itself, Mr McDonnell said.He suggested there are ldquodeeply held doubts in Parliament and Government over Assangersquos case.He said he did not know the views of Labour leadership candidates, but added: ldquoFrom my point of view, Irsquom hoping that the Labour Party overall will oppose this extradition.He said he wanted to see cross-party support for Assange in Parliament.Mr McDonnell also urged people to join peaceful demonstrations in support of Assange outside the court when the hearings start.The Council of Europe, of which the UK is a member state, said granting the extradition would have human rights implications ldquothat reach far beyond his inidual case and would have a ldquochilling effect of media freedom.Its human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatovic, said: ldquoIn view of both the press freedom implications and the serious concerns over the treatment Julian Assange would be subjected to in

NewsroomWednesday, th February , : pm\"\"Artist impression of the proposed Southern Regional College campus at CraigavonA grandmother is challenging the decision to grant planning permission for the Southern Regional College amid concerns about the potential impact on wildle and residents.Clare McCann fears otter activity could be harmed by the development at the south lake in Craigavon.During a three-day hearing lawyers for the College insisted no actual evidence of the aquatic mammals classed as a European protected species has been found at the site.However, Mrs McCann’s barrister argued that a survey carried out in  was “well out of date” by the time the project was approved three years later.David Scoffield QC also contended that “contradictory” information contained in a subsequent report for a nearby leisure centre wasn’t taken into account.He told the court that a camera trap then set up at one location was not enough.“One mammal hole on a site which is almost nine hectares... is plainly not a full otter survey,” counsel insisted.Judicial review proceedings were launched after Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council gave the green light to the new college in January .Campaigners opposed to the campus being built in the area claim it will reduce green space in a public park, and lead to an annual influx of thousands of students.Planning approval was ‘irrational and breached legal requirements’, they contend.It was further claimed that the council failed to assess the impact on protected species, including otters, and did not carry out the proper habitats regulations assessment.Resisting the legal challenge, counsel for the local authority described any suggestions that the mammals have been using the lake as inconclusive.He also stressed that the planning permission requires a survey for their presence must be carried out before building work commences.Mr Justice Huddleston confirmed he will deliver judgment in the case at a later date.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\"

Naila and the Uprising chronicles the remarkable real-le journey of Naila Ayesh, a key figure in the First Intada, which forced the world to recognize the Palestinian right to self-determination for the first time.Using evocative animation, intimate interviews, and exclusive archival footage, this film tells the story of a courageous women’s movement at the head of Palestinians’ struggle for freedom, bringing out of anonymity the women activists whose contributions and sacrices changed history, but whose stories have remained untold until now.The presence of Rula Salameh, as part of a ten day IPSC-organised speaking tour across Ireland, will provide an opportunity to hear at first-hand the fears and concerns which Palestinians have for their future.Rula was one of the founders of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation in , following the Oslo Agreement.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
