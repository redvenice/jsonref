It puts 500 jobs at risk.The Duchess of Cambridge’s favourite high street brand is now working with Ernst \u0026amp Young to help decide the \u0027best way through\u0027 the upcoming \u0027difficult and unstable times.\u0027Its undoing was blamed by commentators on high prices and a failure to compete well enough with rivals offering same or next day delivery services. The move comes after LK Bennett reported losses of £5.9 million in 20162017, compared with a £100,000 profit in the previous 12 months. LK Bennett\u0027s founder, Linda Bennett emailed staff today about the intention to file for administration. She thanked staff for their \u0027hard work and dedication\u0027 and added that she didn\u0027t regret returning to the brand in 2017 to try and \u0027reinvigorate\u0027 the label.LK Bennett is the latest in a line of big  names to become causalities in the bloodbath on the high street. The UK\u0027s largest toy shop Toys R Us went into administration in February 2018, leading to an estimated 2,000 redundancies and Marks and Spencer announced plans last  May to close 100 stores by 2022.  The British brand opened in 1990 and is now well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities and royals including Kate Middleton who is pictured wearing dresses from the brand during a tour of Australia in 2014Fashion brand Orla Kiely, which was also loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, also went out of business with debts of more than £7.25m (€8.1m) last year. High Street clothing giant Gap also announced today that it will close 230 stores worldwide as its US parent company launches a massive restructuring programme.The closures amount to nearly a fifth of its total shops although the company has not said where stores will shut or how many jobs will be affected.           Shoppers have said the brand put prices up after Kate Middleton started wearing their clothes          LK Bennett is the latest big name to become a casualty in the bloodbath on the high street          The Sludge wedge increased by £20 after it became popular with Kate Middleton          LK Bennett\u0027s Natalie clutch bag also increased in price by £20 in 2012Both of these items saw their price increase by £20 after the royal was snapped in public with them.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail how labels can struggle to keep up with demand  after  public figures wear their clothes.She said: \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand\u0027 can \u0027involve huge costs for the label.\u0027                                                    However customers have said the store \u0027put their prices up\u0027 after Kate started being seen wearing their clothes and got engaged to Prince William.Others have also criticised the brand\u0027s prices, saying \u0027that not many people have £300 spare to buy one dress\u0027.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail: \u0027Celebrity endorsement is the holy grail for any retailer, although it can bring with it as many problems as benefits.\u0027Having your high street label worn in public by one of the world\u0027s most photographed women can prove to be a nightmare if you\u0027re not forewarned, which is usually the case with Kate Middleton.Ms Shiels added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once.\u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.\u0027Fashion commentator Karine Laudort also told MailOnline: \u0027The Duchess of Cambridge may be a fan but the everyday woman in Britain may think twice before spending an extra £100 on a outfit, \u0027Especially when most online retailers now offer free 24-hour or same day delivery.\u0027 Today the brand was running an offer for 25 per cent off the entire new season range online and in store.Customers could also enjoy free UK delivery on all orders. Items  in the new range that were eligible for the discount included colourful court shoes priced at £195, a gold envelope clutch bag costing £175 and a variety of midi dresses costing around £300.  LK Bennett is well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities such as Holly Willoughby and royals including Kate Middleton.Kate took a two year hiatus from the brand and wasn\u0027t spotted wearing it on any public occasions after August 2016. But she reaffirmed her love for it, just a few months ago – wearing a green and cream silk polka dot dress for a visit to the Evelina London Children\u0027s hospital, in December 2018.           Kate, pictured at Kings Cross St Pancras station in London, also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen in March 2012  Holly Willoughby, left in one of the brand\u0027s dresses at the Chelsea Flower Show in May and Katherine Jenkins, right in the Izzy dress and Priyanka Courts at her album signing in London in December, are also among the famous fans of the fashion label          Linda Bennett, pictured at Buckingham Palace, received an OBE for services to the fashion industry in the New Year Honours list in 2016Kate also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen during her Diamond Jubilee UK Tour in 2012. This elegant look included the £395 Jude jacket and £225 Davina dress which she paired with a pillbox hat by James Lock. High Street clothing giant Gap to close 230 stores worldwide...The curse of Kate!

Linda Bennett, pictured, came back to the company in 2017 after leaving in 2008 when she sold her majority stake  for between £80m and 100mBennett founded the brand 29 years ago in 1990 with a store in Wimbledon, London. The brand grew quickly into an international chain and Bennett decided to sell the business to Phoenix Equity Partners and Sirius Equity in 2008 for around £80-100million.Despite having sold off the brand she retained a stake on the company board, before re-joining in 2017 as a consultant to the management team.In September 2017 Bennett increased her investment in the company and bought out the remaining equity from private equity owner Phoenix Equity Partners and at the time the brand was operating more than 260 shops and concessions in more than 30 countries.After the acquisition by Bennett the company stated that it would continue to expand and subsequently launched stores in China, Russia and the US.  The curse of Kate!

The high street store is set to file for administration\u0027Retailers must walk a fine line between supply and demand, with production based on a number of factors including historical sales figures, market trends and buyer behaviour. \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand, which is what happens to a garment when the Duchess is spotted wearing it, often means that another immediate production run is required to satisfy demand and maximise the sales opportunity. \u0027Unfortunately, this can involve huge costs for the label, which then is unable to forecast when the sales surge is likely to suddenly drop again. \u0027The science behind production is therefore thrown into disarray and costs can easily spiral.\u0027 The Duchess, 37, has been spotted wearing L.K. Bennett numerous times - from a printed blue and white dress to her go-to black booties.Claire added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once. \u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.           The Duchess of Cambridge sporting an LK Bennett dress for a dinner at Kensington Palace, London, during former US President Barack Obama\u0027s state visit to Britain in 2016          Kate, 37, wore a white and blue floral L.K.Bennett dress during a visit to Luton with national charity Youthscape in August 2016\u0027Despite the financial woes currently experienced by some of her favourite labels however, it is the market – not Kate - that is to blame for the mass closure of many high street stores. \u0027As well as L.K.Bennett Hobbs, Orla Kiely, Alice Temperley and Issa have all experienced significant financial difficulties.\u0027Although it\u0027s a difficult time for retail, Claire claims some lower-priced brands including Zara and Primark have got it right.She said: \u0027Zara is in the enviable position to have been able to bring its manufacturing process in-house rather than outsourcing abroad, meaning costs are reduced and the brand is able to react quickly to a sudden increase in demand. \u0027At the other end of the scale, Primark is continuing to thrive due, it is said to its mass market appeal and its focus on engagement with its customers through social media.\u0027It is the stores which are best able to adapt and have a supply chain flexible enough to cope with fluctuating demand and market trends which will survive.

They could be a little more generous with the garlic butter inside.Winner: Waitrose. It’s smaller than the M\u0026ampS version but nearly half the price and just as tasty.PEPPERONI PIZZA          Smaller than it appears on the outside of the box, Waitrose\u0027s pepperoni pizza is pretty averageWaitrose — Stonebaked and hand-stretched (385g)PRICE: £4.50TASTE: Smaller than it appears on the outside of the box, this is a pretty average pizza. The sprinkling of parsley on top is a nice touch, but the meat itself tastes bland and processed.M\u0026ampS — ‘The American’ hand-stretched and stonebaked (440g)PRICE: £4TASTE: The base is thin and crisp, the toppings are generous and the pepperoni is spicy. The cheese is spread right to the edges, too.Winner: M\u0026ampS.

It\u0027s full of chunky chicken and tomatoWaitrose — Indian chicken tikka masala (350g)PRICE: £3.99TASTE: Billed as ‘marinated chargrilled chicken in a tandoori-spiced cream and tomato sauce’, this Indian classic sounds mouth-watering. The reality is a let-down: insipid sauce and barely any meat.M\u0026ampS — Chicken tikka masala (400g)PRICE: £4TASTE: There’s more kick to this, which is full of chunky chicken and tomato. It’s also less fatty, so I don’t feel guilty tucking in.Winner: M\u0026ampS.

But the sauce is cloying, and the slices of beef are pitifully thin.Winner: Waitrose, by a whisker. Both are pricey options, and neither lives up to expectations.APPLE PIE          Waitrose\u0027s is made with whole apples, blackberries and apple puree.

The pastry puffs up beautifully in the oven.Winner: M\u0026ampS, which just pips Waitrose on price, and triumphs in taste and appearance.BIRTHDAY CAKE          M\u0026ampS\u0027 is much denser and more artificial-tasting than the Waitrose birthday cakeWaitrose — Sponge for ten, hand-decorated with raspberry jam and buttercream filling (630g)PRICE: £7TASTE: The sponge is fluffy, and the icing melts in the mouth. It is packed with jam and cream, which squidges out of each slice.M\u0026ampS — Star sponge for eight, with raspberry jam and buttercream (630g)PRICE: £6.75TASTE: Much denser and more artificial-tasting, this would never pass muster on Bake Off. There’s barely any filling and the icing comes away at the sides.Winner: Waitrose.

At just £8 a bottle, it’s very drinkable, and leaves me feeling refreshed rather than light-headed.Winner: M\u0026ampS.

It tastes like tropical fruit — and is about as refined as you’ll get from a supermarket plonk.M\u0026ampS — Californian Colombard chardonnay 2017 (12 per cent vol)PRICE: £5.25TASTE: Despite the fancy bottle, this tastes more like Jacob’s Creek than a sophisticated chardonnay. It’s a little too dry and vanilla-like for me, and doesn’t pack much alcohol per volume.Winner: Waitrose. It’s worth paying extra for a wine so surprisingly good.RED WINE          Winner: M\u0026ampS. A classy supermarket wine for just over a fiverWaitrose — Soft and juicy Chilean (12.5 per cent vol)PRICE: £4.99TASTE: This is meant to be ‘mellow’ and ‘chocolatey’, but from the first sip mine tastes bland and lifeless. The bottle makes it look cheaper than it is, too.M\u0026ampS — Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon 2018PRICE: £5.25TASTE: There’s far more body to this M\u0026ampS red, which tastes great with a big bowl of pasta. It’s smooth, fruity, and dangerously easy to drink.Winner: M\u0026ampS.

In addition to the 11,480 seats set aside for England Rugby Hospitality by the RFU, 1,640 were reserved for ‘commercial sponsors’.Debenture holders – who are granted a ten-year right to ticket issues – accounted for just under 20 per cent of the ticket-holders, with 15,580 seats.

(Stock image)A paltry four per cent of tickets – 3,280 – were allocated to what the RFU calls ‘fans’. But according to the union, this category is defined as ‘England Rugby Club members, England Rugby Travel customers, 02 priority members and residents living in the leafy suburb of Twickenham’.A spokesman for the RFU said: ‘We are a union ultimately run by our membership – rugby clubs. Our clubs pay subscriptions and associated fees, and we offer international tickets to our membership first.‘We also allocate tickets to rugby clubs to promote the game of rugby and help enable fans to come to Twickenham.’Constitutionally, at least 50 per cent of the seats at Twickenham have to be allocated to our rugby clubs.’The RFU said the number of tickets available to the public varies on a game by game basis, depending on the take-up from clubs. More tickets are likely to be available for matches against smaller nations. The RFU also confirmed that members were entitled to cheaper tickets.Another way to access seats is through a £25 annual membership of England Rugby.But Six Nations tickets were sold to members last year and the club is not currently accepting new members.

The former education secretary has spearheaded a series of radical reforms to raise standards and toughen up qualificationsAsked if Vote Leave misled voters in the 2016 referendum into thinking immigration would fall after Brexit, he said people had wanted ‘democratic control’ over numbers.‘The second thing is we’ve seen public attitudes towards migration change,’ he added.‘Now that people know that we have democratic control, actually there’s been a greater degree of acceptance of migration overall.’The Environment Secretary said people were ‘more tolerant’ in countries like Australia and Canada, where governments could set numbers.Asked where that left Theresa May’s target to cut immigration to the tens of thousands, he said voters could use their vote at general elections to punish a government they disagreed with.Mr Gove admitted that when he decided to back the Leave campaign in 2016 he thought it would lose.He said: ‘My own view was that actually I didn’t think we would win the referendum, I didn’t think we would leave, although I’m glad that was the result.’He confirmed he urged David Cameron strongly not to hold a referendum, as it would ‘create isions’.‘I remember saying at the time... that I didn’t think that it was a good idea,’ he said. "},{"url":null,"title":"Sweet moment Morehouse professor takes students baby class sitter","story":"    Nathan Alexander, a math professor at Morehouse College in Atlanta, was snapped in the Friday picture holding an adorable little girl while in class          \u0027Student came to class today with his child due to no babysitter or anybody to watch her while he was in class,\u0027 said user Nick Vaughn in the Twitter post. \u0027My professor NATHAN ALEXANDER said “I’ll hold her so you can take good notes!” #HBCU #morehouse #Respect\u0027          Alexander responded under the post and thanked the user for snapping the moment, adding that he appreciated the loveThe viral post has received more than 42,000 likes and has been retweeted more than 10,000 times.   Alexander responded under the post and thanked the user for snapping the moment, adding that he appreciated the love. On Facebook, Vaughn would further explain what all went down when the student brought his child to the class. \u0027Not only did he teach the entire lecture with the child in his arms but also stayed after class helping those with questions about today’s lecture with the child still in his arms as seen in the pictures,\u0027 he said on the Facebook post.   On Facebook, Vaughn would provide more photos of the professor and explained that he kept the baby even after class while taking additional questions  Alexander has been a professor at the college since 2017, according to his LinkedIn.

We\u0027re on the precipice of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil again for the first time since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011,\u0027 said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. The only thing keeping Ripley company was a soft plush toy version of planet Earth - which demonstrated when the rocket reached zero gravity.Elated Musk shared a video of the toy floating in space on his Twitter shortly after the successful launch.As the rocket took off, NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken looked on.The pair could strap into another Dragon capsule as early as July for the second space demo.           Pictured: Sigourney Weaver as Ripley in Alien (1979)It\u0027s been eight years since Hurley and three other astronauts flew the last space shuttle mission, and human launches from Florida ceased.NASA turned to private companies, SpaceX and Boeing, and has provided them $8 billion to build and operate crew capsules to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. Now Russian rockets are the only way to get astronauts to the 250-mile-high outpost. Soyuz tickets have skyrocketed over the years - NASA currently pays $82million per seat.Boeing aims to conduct the first test flight of its Starliner capsule in April, with astronauts on board possibly in August.An estimated 5,000 NASA and contractor employees, tourists and journalists gathered in the wee hours at Kennedy Space Center with the SpaceX launch team, as the Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from the same spot where Apollo moon rockets and space shuttles once soared.Bridenstine said he\u0027s confident that astronauts will soar on a Dragon or Starliner - or both - by year\u0027s end. But he stressed there\u0027s no rush.          SpaceX founder Elon Musk gave a post-launch news conference this morning after the test flight successfully took off          The capsule\u0027s only passenger was a test dummy (pictured), named Ripley after the lead character in the Alien movies          This latest, flashiest Dragon is on a fast track to reach the space station on Sunday morning, just 27 hours after liftoff           NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken could strap in as early as July if this test flight goes well   Pictured: the Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket, ready for launch, sits on pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, yesterday\u0027We are not in a space race,\u0027 he said. \u0027That race is over. We went to the moon and we won. It\u0027s done. Now we\u0027re in a position where we can take our time and make sure we get it right.\u0027 The white crew Dragon is slightly bigger than cargo versions - 27 feet (8 meters) tip to tip - and considerably fancier and safer.It features four seats, three windows, touch-screen computer displays and life-support equipment, as well as eight abort engines to pull the capsule to safety in the event of a launch emergency. Solar cells are mounted on the spacecraft for electrical power, as opposed to the protruding solar wings on cargo Dragons.\u0027It\u0027s an incredibly sleek looking vehicle from the inside and it\u0027s very easy to operate,\u0027 Hurley told reporters just hours before liftoff. He said he marvels at how the Dragon has just 30 buttons and touch screens, compared with the space shuttle cockpit\u0027s 2,000 switches and circuit breakers.For the test, the Ripley dummy was strapped into the far left seat, wearing the company\u0027s snappy white spacesuit. The other seats were empty, save for a small plush toy resembling Earth that was free to float once reaching zero-gravity. \u0027Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!\u0027 Musk tweeted.SpaceX already has made 16 trips to the space station using cargo Dragons - but this capsule is slightly bigger than those at  27 feet (8 meters) tip to tip, and considerably fancier and safer          The Dragon capsule features four seats, three windows, touch-screen computer displays and life-support equipment, as well as eight abort engines to pull the capsule to safety in the event of a launch emergencyAs many as seven astronauts could squeeze in, although four will be the norm once flights get going, allowing for a little cargo room. About 450 pounds (200 kilograms) of supplies are going up on this flight.The capsule is designed to dock and undock automatically with the space station. Cargo Dragon must be maneuvered with the station\u0027s robot arm.Like Ripley, the capsule is rigged with sensors. Engineers will be carefully watching sound, vibration and other stresses on the spacecraft, while monitoring the life-support, communication and propulsion systems. Some of the equipment needs more work - possibly even redesign - before serving human passengers.\u0027We\u0027re going to learn a ton from this mission,\u0027 said NASA\u0027s commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders.Flight operations team members - some of them new to this - also need the six-day trial run, according to Kennedy Space Center\u0027s director, Robert Cabana.The objective is to make the next demo flight, with Hurley and Behnken, as safe as possible. The more immediate goal is to avoid harming the space station and its three occupants: an American, Canadian and Russian.Despite SpaceX\u0027s success at recovering and reusing its rockets, NASA is insisting on brand new boosters from SpaceX for the crew capsule flights. The first-stage booster used Saturday aimed for a floating platform in the Atlantic, following the predawn liftoff. SpaceX plans to recycle the newly flying capsule for a high-altitude abort test this spring, along with a booster launched and retrieved a week ago.

Outside the terraced house at 81 Grove Lane, three men had hung a plain white photographic backdrop from the front window. A few metres away, fixed to a tripod, was a motor-driven 35mm Nikon camera with a long cable release. The men said they wanted to make a big community family album for Handsworth and were inviting people who lived in the area to take their own picture.“My siblings and I – there were eight of us – went over with great excitement and decided to take a photo,” Korotania recalls nearly 40 years on. When it was her and Amerjit’s turn, the two 11-year-olds in their matching shalwar kameez turned their backs to the camera, showing off waist-length pigtails. Kanta clicked the cable-release button, triggering the shutter, and in unison they spun round to take another picture facing the camera. Then they walked off, laughing.The Korotanias were among the first to participate in the Handsworth Self-Portrait project, devised by Derek Bishton, Brian Homer and the late John Reardon, who were running a creative agency out of the house at number 81. Bishton and Homer, both from Birmingham, had trained in journalism and graphic design respectively, whereas Reardon, who had moved from South Africa to England aged 15, was a photography student at the local polytechnic.Over the following two months, across five weekend sessions, more than 500 people from the area stepped up to the backdrop inidually or in groups, faced the camera – or each other – and pressed the button. Some were solemn, some looked a bit bemused, but most were smiling or laughing, and a few struck playful poses: the kid in the cowboy hat pointing his toy gun at the lens, the reggae musician frozen in a gravity-defying dance move, the young couple kissing as the shutter clicked.In each case, it was the subjects, not the photographers, controlling the moment of capture. “We said: ‘You take the picture when you’re ready. If you want to pose you pose, it’s up to you entirely,’” says Bishton. “We did check the framing and focus, but then we stepped away.”This hands-off approach was important to the three men, who were all newcomers to the area. Two years earlier, Homer had been commissioned to produce reports for a community development project in Handsworth. He asked Bishton, whom he knew from working on a local listings magazine called Grapevine, to help him with design and editing. Reardon, who had taken photos for the same magazine, joined their budding creative agency a year later.Handsworth back then was a predominantly black and minority ethnic area. Migrants from Jamaica, arriving in Britain to contribute to the war effort and the post-war rebuilding programme, had settled there in the 40s and 50s, finding a well-to-do suburb with large villas and an attractive park. As the white middle classes moved out, families from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh took their place, drawn by manufacturing work in Birmingham’s foundries and car plants.By the 70s, though, local industry was in decline and work was drying up – 52,000 jobs in inner-city Birmingham were lost between 1971 and 1976. A year later, as Bishton and Homer were setting up shop in Handsworth, it was estimated that a quarter of young black people in the area were unemployed. Properties deteriorated, tensions escalated between ethnic groups, and confrontations with the police became routine. For the media, Handsworth became a byword for inner-city decline, and often a chance to pin the blame on its newer inhabitants. “The tree-lined street where I used to live has become an alley of putrefaction,” Frederick Whitehead, editor of Birmingham’s Sunday Mercury, wrote of the area in 1977. “Many of its houses are pustules of social profanity, its gutters gather the jetsam of decay, the faces of alien people who live there are a fretwork of sullen resignation.”It was impressions such as these that Bishton and Homer were determined to challenge. “We noticed how the media portrayed Handsworth,” Homer tells me. “The reporting was generally negative, highlighting problems without looking at the considerable cultural activity and other positive things going on there. We felt Handsworth wasn’t a problem area as it was defined.”When the pair first went out to document the community, Bishton admits they felt “a little overawed by the issues facing us. We were conscious of being white photographers in a very multicultural area.” Commissioned by a local voluntary organisation called Affor (All Faiths For One Race) to produce a report about the black community’s relations with the police, Bishton recalls going into Rastafarian squats with cameras and being met with suspicion: “What were we doing? Who were we working for? What were our motivations?”“Attie used mirrors to allow people to see what they were taking,” says Homer. “We decided on a more simple set-up, a camera, a cable release, a plain backdrop, to show people without the stereotypical inner-city backgrounds – the rundown streets, the clutter.”They set up their makeshift studio at the front of the house, where it had the advantage of visibility. “It was on a main shopping route with shops over the road, a fish’n’chip shop, a butcher’s, a betting shop, and a good throughput of people,” says Bishton.On the first Saturday, they had no idea how the project would be received. As an incentive, they offered free prints to each subject, to be collected a week later. But they had very little problem finding willing participants. “The kids came along first, without any inhibitions, and started it off,” says Bishton. “When they got their free picture the following week, they’d show it to their elder siblings and parents, and they came along as well. The number and the ersity of people – young, old, black, Asian, white – was just amazing.”One of the kids in that first session, who goes by the name Ting-A-Ling and now runs a youth project in Handsworth, recalls passing by the outdoor studio on his way to the shops. “For a 13-year-old boy, it was fascinating,” he says. “That kind of thing never happened in Handsworth.” Instead of clicking the button once or twice, he fired off a dozen photos. The final image, in which he points at the camera, his face creased by an enormous grin, is currently being used to promote the forthcoming Handsworth Self Portrait: 40 Years On show at the MAC gallery in Birmingham.After the fifth and final session in early October 1979, the trio narrowed the work down to 44 images and Reardon retreated to the darkroom to print them. The results went on show in community centres and galleries in Birmingham, Nottingham and Sheffield. “Then they all went into a box with the negatives and that was it,” says Bishton. “We moved on.”Drawing on the considerable goodwill they’d generated from the project, Bishton and Reardon went on to make their seminal 1984 book Home Front in Handsworth, while Homer moved to run other design agencies and take photos on the side. Bishton later worked at the , developing its online newspaper, while Reardon joined the Observer as a photographer and picture editor. By the time of Reardon’s death last April, aged 66, he had amassed an extraordinary body of work, ranging from war photographs in Afghanistan and Kosovo to arresting chef portraits for the Observer Food Monthly magazine – though his compassionate sensibility already appears fully formed in the Handsworth series.Now Bishton and Homer have revisited the series as they prepare for the MAC show. “I think it stands up extremely well, on a number of levels,” says Homer, noting the powerful effect that assuming control can have on the people in the frame. “They’re often more relaxed, more engaged,” he says.“There’s a power and a joy in it,” agrees Reardon’s partner, Sacha Lehrfreund. “You get a sense that people are thinking: This is mine, I have ownership over this image, and I’m relevant and important. Giving people a voice like that is extraordinary.”“If you look at the photos, people are happy and smiling,” says Michael Henry, who appears in one of the photographs with his reggae group Afrikan Star. “At the time we were having a very hard time with the system, there was a lot of racism and sexism images that were shown of black and Asian people were very negative. To have something showing such a positive image of Handsworth was a really great thing.”• Handsworth Self Portrait: 40 Years On runs at MAC Birmingham from 23 March to 2 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608d038f43fefabb5ea7ff714de6bafa805ccac5/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6b9da90b5edbecef1f211046318b2957 1440w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Kim Jong-un’s summit with Donald Trump in Vietnam, demonstrations at the border between Colombia and Venezuela, and Paris fashion week – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1bdae5cd1ce3cf788429d38d53f2f6221be84e2/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd389641fb60b3573fe3c3960b55dc7","title":"sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras in pictures","story":"A selection of images from the 41st annual parade, the theme of which was ‘fearless’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f9bc2e40b5fe216a1b730c42b2a6200b0d04f54/106_830_3643_2184/master/3643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301abbaeb1129a7e0b2537b624c5cd52","title":"helen oyeyemi gingerbread interview","story":"The award-winning author on her passion for food, life in Prague and critics who told her to ‘live a bit’ after publishing her first novel while at schoolHelen Oyeyemi is an award-winning author of eight books. Born in Nigeria, her family moved to London when she was four years old and she published her first novel, The Icarus Girl (2005), while still at school and her second (along with two plays) while at Cambridge University. She won the Somerset Maugham award for White Is for Witching (2009) and the PEN Open Book award for her short story collection, What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours (2016). In 2013, she was named a Granta best young novelist. Now 34, she lives in Prague. Her new novel, Gingerbread, is published this month.Gingerbread is a novel about an inherited recipe for gingerbread. Are you a fan of the stuff?I made a lot of gingerbread while I was writing it and researched how people eat it. My favourite recipe is a really healthy one that uses almond flour and dates. I also use Emily Dickinson’s recipe, which has a thick, rich flavour because of the molasses.Are you a cook, generally, or do you prefer eating out?Eating out on some sort of food quest can be a good way to get a sense of a neighbourhood, I think – or I’m trying to justify an afternoon I spent ambling around New York’s Lower East Side trying scallion pancakes at a number of different restaurants.But I also like the kind of eating you can do with your eyes. That happened unexpectedly for me last spring when I was confronted with two centuries’-old pieces of sculpture at the National Palace Museum in Taipei: the Jadeite Cabbage and the Meat-Shaped Stone. I’d never dreamt that cabbage and meat could be captured so delicately and exuberantly for the ages.Your characters in Gingerbread visit a faraway land that, in your novel, Wikipedia describes as nonexistent. Do you use Wikipedia or are you suspicious of it?Wikipedia is my first “go to” place, but you also catch yourself thinking, “What if…”. As a fiction writer, you don’t have to have a serious relationship with fact. You can undermine the facts or play games with them.Do you spend too much time surfing the internet?I scroll through Tumblr a lot. And I window-shop. On Etsy, I cultivate a wishlist packed with vintage and handcrafted items I admire and can’t own. Seventy-five percent of the time merely looking (and looking and looking) is enough, but my most recent wishlist addition is a crown made of gold lace – it’s described in the listing as “adult size” and I’m simultaneously sheepish and delighted about that. I might make an actual move on this one.You live in Prague now. What led you to leave Britain and do you no longer consider London to be your home?The first time I came to Prague was in 2010, when I stayed for six months. I missed it so much that I came back in 2013 and it’s where I’ve been for the past six years. The surrealists loved it and it’s a very layered city it could be a film set it could be a fairytale it could be a gritty, brutalist corner. It’s a combination of hard and soft. But I go back to London twice a year and it’s home to me, but I was just looking for something else and lived in other places.How good or bad is your Czech? Is it a tough language to learn?I think the Czech language might be marginally less tough for a systematic thinker who doesn’t struggle with gendered words and the grammar rules that go with that (so basically lots of people who think and dream in languages other than English). But my vocabulary isn’t so bad and I’m actively growing that through reading and watching some of my favourite Czech New Wave films with the subtitles off. I don’t have any fantasies about fluency, but I’ll keep going so one day I can say a thing or two that might actually make sense to a Czech speaker.You wrote and published your first novel when you were a still a teenager. Is there too much pressure on writers to get their best work out before 40? And do you feel pressure now?I don’t think age should be a thing, especially with writing, of all things. When my first book came out, there were a few snippy reviews saying that this author should “live a bit more”… I haven’t felt any pressure. I have a very interior focus and have just gone from book to book without much awareness of exterior perceptions.• Gingerbread by Helen Oyeyemi is published by Picador (£16.99).

The author of six novels, her latest, Daisy Jones \u0026amp The Six, tells the story of a fictional 70s rock band recording a hit album loosely based on Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours. Publishers Weekly has described it as a “stunning story of sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll in the 1960s and 70s… The prose is propulsive, original and often raw”. Amazon has commissioned a 13-part series based on the book, which will be co-produced with Reese Witherspoon.What drew you to this story?I’m fascinated by the people we make famous, and I’m drawn to the difference between what something looks like on the outside versus what it was like to live. So I wanted to write about the conflict between characters who have this amazing ability to create things together, but personal relationships that are much more fraught. We’ve seen many examples of that in rock, the most obvious being Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Fleetwood Mac are a band and a soap opera.What is it about musicians that speaks to us so strongly?They’re easy to project ourselves, and our fantasies, on to. I worked in Hollywood for a long time, and so I’m relatively aware of my reaction to celebrities and the fact that I don’t actually have a relationship with them. But I remember in the depths of my research, listening to Rumours over and over. It got to the point where I was driving in my car, and I thought: “I just want to know if Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham slept together after Rumours.” I heard myself think that – and that’s insane. I feel so close to them, but that’s because they’re writing about universal things in a specific way that I have a connection to. It’s the same with actors, musicians, writers: we feel seen by them, and that’s a very strong thing.You also wrote the song lyrics. Was writing the fictional equivalent of Rumours intimidating?Very intimidating. But I removed any attempt to be as good as a musician would be: I can’t hold myself to that standard. These are lyrics written by an author, with the intention of signalling to the reader that there are things going on between the lines. So that freed me up a little bit. Hopefully readers will feel like that’s another lens into what happened. It’s what I do with bands I like – I’m looking through Taylor Swift’s lyrics and thinking: “Wait – you said this, so doesn’t that mean this?” I don’t have any right to do that, I don’t know what she’s trying to say, but it’s really fun to do.The 70s LA rock scene is much mythologised, although often the women are either groupies or “muses”… What was your approach?Seventies rock is a fun space to tell a story in, but it is dominated by white males. I wanted to tell a story that felt authentic, but focused on the people I’m interested in writing about: women and women of colour. Daisy, the keyboardist Karen, Billy’s wife Camila, Daisy’s best friend Simone, a disco star very loosely based on Donna Summer – those were the most important characters for me. Making sure their experiences were the ones being centred was something I worked on draft after draft.What kind of a reader were you as a child?Horrible, horrible! I would go to English class having read only the CliffsNotes. Anything I could do to get out of reading a book, I would do. I think it was just because I hadn’t learned that it was something to love yet… it just felt like homework. I had a lot of making up to do at that point.Which book changed your mind?When I was about 13 I got a copy of Bridget Jones’s Diary by Helen Fielding. Page one and I was in! I could not get enough of it. It’s hard to remember now what a breath of fresh air it was when it first came out. I finished it and said, “Mom, take me to the bookstore.” A bit later I really got into Nick Hornby – High Fidelity, About a Boy, I loved them.Who is your literary hero or heroine? Jay Gatsby is the one I’m drawn to, that I keep forming different opinions of, and who lives in my head the most. I’m fascinated by the idea that he tries to exert so much control over things that just simply cannot be controlled. Yet there’s such an innocence to him, even though there’s also a high level of corruption. He’s just a complicated character I keep coming back to and seeing different ways in which his naivety relates to my own life. I have to remind myself not to be a Jay Gatsby.What books are on your bedside table at the moment?I am reading Joan Didion’s Slouching Towards Bethlehem… I have never read it before and I’m really enjoying it. And a book called The Mirage Factory by Gary Krist, which is about the formation of Los Angeles. I’m really into nonfiction about Los Angeles, especially in the first half of the 1900s. It’s such a new city, and was formed in such a specific and interesting way. It’s my home and I’ve lived here for, I guess, 14 years now and there are always new things that I want to learn about it.Do you know if anyone in Fleetwood Mac has been sent a copy of the book?Oh God, I hope so, but I have no idea. But here’s the thing: almost nothing in the book actually happened with Fleetwood Mac – it’s a Fleetwood Mac vibe but it’s not their story. I haven’t actually ripped off their lives I just wanted to spend more time listening to Rumours and needed a good reason to do it.• Daisy Jones \u0026amp the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid is published by Hutchinson (£12.99).

The MPs John Mann and Caroline Flint wouldn’t be under pressure from their constituency members and unions such as Unite and the RMT to back a Brexit deal. Jeremy Corbyn and his advisers might even get on board the People’s Vote bus, ditching the halfhearted stance they have adopted up to now.There is still time to take a less blinkered view as we near the end of the article 50 negotiation period. Not much time, granted. But without a dispassionate reassessment of the EU, it is likely that a majority of MPs, mostly Tory with Mann and Flint in tow, will vote for Theresa May’s revised deal when it is put before parliament either this week or next. It’s that or the UK crashes out, which also remains a possibility.If we accept the definition of neoliberal as the pursuit of free markets, low taxes and privatisation at the expense of state regulation, public welfare support and state-run services, then the most recent example of such behaviour is the EU demand that Greece takes this road to redemption.According to the leftwing Brexit, or Lexit, viewpoint, the Germans took over as the driving force behind Brussels’ reform agenda in the wake of the financial crisis and the Greeks were one of their main victims.Its a simple argument. Unfortunately, that is its only attraction. As with most disputes, it is more complicated and there is wrong on both sides. For a country such as Greece to claim that its overly generous state benefits should be protected by its neighbours, which in the main do not enjoy such benefits, was always a stretch.From the standpoint of most European leaders, not just the Germans, it wasn’t the EU that forced Greece to almost bankrupt itself funding the 2004 Athens Olympics. It wasn’t the EU that forced Greece to build up its military spending to become one of the highest in Nato. In fact, in 2015, only six other Nato countries had military personnel costs higher than Greece’s.Linked to this tale is the austerity the Greeks must suffer for many more years. It’s true the EU can block domestic budgets that overstep debt rules. However, it hasn’t prevented the Syriza government from tackling corrupt businesses, taxing wealthy households and overhauling a public sector that is lubricated by backhanders.Another recent example of Brussels’ neoliberal tendencies is the plan to force governments to offer up their rail networks to competitive tender. This is viewed as the thin end of a large wedge that would see the EU push through the privatisations of most utilities, much as the UK has already done and which the Lexiters dream of reversing.In his book on Europe’s privatisation experiments, Private Island, James Meek shows how the sale of state assets to private firms relies for its “success” on driving down costs, usually with steep wage cuts and weak terms and conditions of employment to the fore.However, the way privatisations have been carried out in the Netherlands, Italy and the UK has been under domestic regulations, not the diktat of Brussels. The generosity of minimum wages, the strength of union laws and enforcement of employment regulations above the minimums set by Brussels are governed by member states.In the case of rail privatisation, a closer look shows that the EU rules are flexible and allow state-owned businesses to run trains. State-owned businesses can also operate the underlying rail network, as happens in the UK, though operation of trains and network must be separated.Critics on the left say Brussels has been captured by lobbyists for multinational companies. They say this without acknowledging that Brussels is blocking monopoly mergers and the exploits of the tech companies with more rigour than any other jurisdiction.It’s easy to understand why Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg want to escape the EU and its demands for basic rights, but for those on the left who want to achieve better workers’ terms, to follow their lead only gives rightwing Brexiters the destructive tools they crave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b38aa896f03a85d4648d92ccca635c669a4cf4f/0_0_4665_2799/master/4665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbf1321d166d0c683ffa3e64fd644436","title":"a powerful argument for radical change readers respond to guardian concrete week","story":"From highlighting favourite Brutalist gems to suggesting construction alternatives, readers have had lots to say about our concrete coverageThis week  Cities has been investigating the contentious issue of concrete. While it has brought about improvements in public health and some celebrated works of architecture, the material is causing widespread destruction across the globe.As our coverage explored concrete’s different angles – its environmental impact, its influence on culture, the brutalist buildings under threat, and potential alternative materials – many of you joined in the debate.We were overwhelmed by your response, from photos of your favourite concrete beauties and detested monstrosities, to tales of how concrete has shaped your cities, such as this Instagram post from the Birmingham Civic Society about the legacy of its “concrete collar”.On Twitter there was an impassioned debate over whether the demolition of Birmingham’s old Central Library – a former brutalist landmark – was architectural vandalism or the right decision for the city.You also expressed alarm at the dangers that the production and use of concrete is posing to the planet, and several of you, inspired by Fiona Harvey’s report on alternatives to concrete, shared examples of more environmentally friendly materials and methods.Jonathan Watts, the ’s Environment editor, kicked off our Concrete Week with an in-depth report on the shocking impact of concrete on the planet. Here’s a selection of your many responses to his report:Fiona Harvey reported on the new alternatives to concrete being developed, such as cross-laminated timber. David Hopkins, managing director of the Timber Trade Federation, got in touch to reiterate the benefits of wood: “There are lots of advantages to building in timber – managed forests provide a range of environmental benefits, helping to produce oxygen, provide bioerse habitats and natural management of water, reducing flood risk. As a material that absorbs rather than emits carbon, timber continues to make a positive contribution to the environment after it is harvested, and has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any material used for building.”Other readers told us about other potential solutions we’d missed. Hemp – perhaps not commonly associated with the construction industry – has long been celebrated as an alternative building and insulation material. “Hempcrete” is made with a mix of hemp hurds, lime and water, and is used mainly for non-structural building materials and wall insulation. Once the plant is turned into hempcrete it continues to absorb CO2.Straw is another option. Straw Works, for example, manufactures pre-fabricated straw panels. The company says: “Load bearing walls are either built of load bearing straw bales, or timber frame infilled with straw.” As an alternative to concrete foundations it is also using car tyres for the new community hall by Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, London.We also heard about Gnanli Landrou, a scientist and entrepreneur, who is developing a process to turn clay-based excavation material into a soil-based concrete, which doesn’t use cement – the key material that is most responsible for concrete’s shocking carbon footprint.You contacted us to tell us about cement companies that are attempting to make the production process less harmful to the environment. The manufacture of clinker is the most-energy intensive part of cement production, with half of concrete’s CO2 emissions created during this process. Dalmia Cement, Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement in India say they are trying to change the way they produce clinker, and are using recycled industrial waste. They use low-grade limestone, with fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and slag (waste from the steel industry) in their blended cements.One reader on Twitter also said:Structural engineer Nawid Daoud, meanwhile, argued that – although he supports sustainable alternative materials – some elements of construction can’t be done using sustainable, commercially viable alternatives (yet). He says for certain components of buildings, concrete is still the most viable option both from a material strength perspective, and from a cost perspective.For example, the vast majority of building foundations are concrete, and you will struggle to find an alternative, more sustainable material which will perform in the same way as concrete does under intense compression, let alone one which is widely available (and therefore affordable).”You took to Instagram to post concrete-inspired photos, and wrote about your affection for certain concrete structures.Mark Cowan from UK Truckmixer Training got in touch to flag up the importance of training for drivers who deliver concrete. Cowan, who has worked as a concrete mixer driver for 28 years, says these vehicles are frequently subject to rollover incidents.… we received this photo of concrete hippos in Glenrothes, Fife.Thanks to all of you who submitted comments, emails, tweets, posts and images.

These have been proposed and adopted on a limited basis for over 20 years, but the cement industry has strongly lobbied against them in Europe, the US, Canada and elsewhere.Tell your local political representative that you will no longer stand for this and that you support a cement tax as part of a global carbon tax.Use timber, straw, bamboo or hempcrete – or consider some of the cement-free alternatives (carrots, anyone?) that are now being developed.If you do demolish concrete at home, make sure to recycle it in some way – here are some ideas for ways to do that.Most cement is not, of course, poured in backyard digs or concrete jewellery sold on Etsy – so don’t feel too guilty about enjoying polished concrete floors or beautiful Brutalist architecture.Instead, the vast majority of concrete goes into huge infrastructural projects, such as the Three Gorges Dam in China or the Thames Tideway in the UK.In the UK, the biggest consumer of concrete is likely to be the HS2 project rail project, which will pour an estimated 20m tonnes of the stuff – enough to pave over an area the size of Manchester.Adding your voice to public pressure to modify these projects to use less concrete and to only proceed if they are absolutely necessary – and not just efforts to artificially inflate GDP as is so often the case globally – will go much further towards reducing concrete use than anything you can do at home.This week, a group of institutional investors coordinated by ShareAction, with over $1tn of assets under management, sent letters to company CEOs, including two large concrete firms, to ask them to set emissions targets in line with the Paris climate agreement.Instead of just asking for disclosure of climate risks, these investors are asking for hard targets, and to sign up to a number of initiatives related to renewable electricity, energy productivity and electric vehicles.The cement firms contacted include Cemex (Mexico), Heidelberg Cement (Germany), Taiheiyo Cement Corporation (Japan), Siam Cement (Thailand), Akçansa Çimento (Turkey), Shree Cement (India), Cementos Argos (Colombia), the China National Building Material Company, and LafargeHolcim (Switzerland).“Cement has been on our radar for a while now,” says Beau O’Sullivan of ShareAction. “It was a priority sector agreed with the investor group because it is one of the most carbon-intensive industries.”Two firms have responded to the request so far. Cemex said it is unable to commit, due to uncertainties about how it will capture the carbon dioxide it releases and what it says are unfavourable regulations, and said it will review its position in the next reporting cycle. Heidelberg said last June that it is in the final stages of approving the requests.The other firms have not responded.China National Building Material, meanwhile, has announced plans to construct 100 cement factories across 50 nations.Construction is a conservative industry. Developers are loth to use recycled concrete, to test out alternatives or to use less concrete because concrete is cheap and well known.They are also wary of spending more on alternatives to concrete, in part because they think consumers won’t pay the extra costs.Prove to them otherwise, by requesting reduced concrete in new buildings or projects you are part of commissioning and advocate for a greater use of innovations and alternatives.The most severe, but least understood, impact of concrete is that it destroys natural infrastructure without replacing the ecological functions that humanity depends on for fertilisation, pollination, flood control, oxygen production and water purification.As Jonathan Watts writes, our concrete slabs “entomb vast tracts of fertile soil, constipate rivers, choke habitats and – acting as a rock-hard second skin – desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses”.He makes a powerful case for how concrete transforms a culture (a civilisation intertwined with nature) into an economy (a production unit obsessed by GDP statistics, which politicians can inflate for personal gain … simply by pouring more concrete).Arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature-based cultures with data-driven economies. That requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete, and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity.So get out, see some trees, change your mindset – and remember that underneath all that hard grey there’s a natural world we still depend on for our survival.

In one episode, wearing an expensive-looking brown suede safari jacket with big collar, and clutching his oversize glasses in his hands, he introduces the studio audience to Jonathan Miller. They discuss Miller’s new production of The Merchant of Venice, the director going on to predict the “slow disintegration” of English theatre.It’s a real spirit-of-the-age moment. There is no apology for the elevated tone of their conversation the format is simple – two cultural polymaths ruminating on the arts on primetime television.Television was a medium that the conductor understood completely. Over the previous years, he had hosted more than two dozen editions of André Previn’s Music Night, a shiny-floor light entertainment show in which the star guests were the players of the London Symphony Orchestra. Previn was the ensemble’s chief conductor. Eschewing formal concert dress for open-necked shirts and casual trousers, they performed popular classics introduced with a light touch by the maestro.This long-running series followed Previn’s big TV breakthrough in 1971, as the straight man to Morecambe and Wise in their sketch about the Grieg Piano Concerto, with its celebrated punchline: “I’m playing all the right notes. But not necessarily in the right order.”Classical music still has its star conductors today: Simon Rattle, Daniel Barenboim, Valery Gergiev. But when was the last time one of them was on BBC1? These days, a proliferation of channels means sumptuous coverage of the Proms on BBC4 or live concerts from Paris and St Petersburg on streaming services such as Medici.tv. But the nature of our multichannel world means audiences are inevitably relatively small. When Previn was on the main TV channel each week, several million of his audience would have discovered him by accident when idly switching over from ITV or BBC2. Some might have complained about what they saw as yet more classical music on the BBC. But a significant number would have stayed put, introduced for the first time to the riches of Ravel, Strauss or Shostakovich.Previn had a busy orchestral rehearsal schedule the day The Morecambe \u0026amp Wise Show was recorded at BBC Television Centre, but it was an opportunity he was not going to miss. The conductor would have been very well aware that Eric and Ernie’s Christmas special reached audiences of more than 25m, almost half the UK population. An appearance guaranteed immediate attention, at a level impossible to contemplate in today’s multichannel TV world.Previn had realised the importance of celebrity early on, growing up in Hollywood. A young exile from Nazi Germany, he had little but his musical talent to help him on his way. While still a teenager, he was earning money working as an arranger and orchestrator for MGM, getting to meet the great stars of the day on the studio lot and at parties where he would play jazz piano. Before the age of 36, he had made four Oscar acceptance speeches for his work on films including Gigi and My Fair Lady. Why should he give up the glamour provided by the film world just because he wanted to become a great classical conductor?When he took charge of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1968, he was a very contemporary kind of musical leader. His hairstyle suggested the Beatles, his fashion sense was distinctly modish, with long, monotone silk cravats and turtleneck sweaters. His then girlfriend, later wife, was Mia Farrow, who had previously been married to Frank Sinatra. Previn was a man used to photographers, press conferences and ranks of fans gathered outside stage doors. All of this he could use to promote both himself and the broader cause of classical music.Previn’s career took the form of a carefully engineered circle. His fame reassured record industry executives that his discs would sell. Orchestras keen to increase their profiles paid him lavishly to ensure his services as a conductor. As a result, TV executives who wanted classical music in their schedules alongside news, drama and sport booked him as a host. Which only helped build his fame.A year or so back, I was eating in a London restaurant when Simon Rattle walked in. My friend and I were excited at the idea of the celebrated new music director of the London Symphony Orchestra sitting just a few tables away. But only a few other diners looked up, most of the business-lunching clientele clearly oblivious to the presence of one of today’s great classical music stars. In Previn’s heyday, he turned heads wherever he went, with paparazzi waiting to catch him as he left concert halls or restaurants. His sheer recognisability pushed classical music up the agenda. His association with a composer or orchestra meant people took notice and he found new audiences among viewers who never before had believed Beethoven or Mozart was for them. Classical music could well use a figure of his fame and glamour again today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88412d6c714132ee677013b413367ced9179c6f1/0_240_4016_2410/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=265d96c00e76194a01390b9f9bc2be2e","title":"thought for the day silence bbc preachers who keep women down thought for the day","story":"And welcome to the amoral maze, where our dilemma of the week is: just how insufferable does a spiritual leader have to be before he or she becomes unqualified to preach at the general public? Or to put it another way, why should the church have a monopoly on excommunication?The question is not, emphatically, restricted to the case of the ubiquitous prelate, blogger and speaker, Giles Fraser, although with his recent blog – chastising women who fail to stay near home for the future convenience of incontinent fathers – he has done more than most to focus attention on the sort of qualities that should, ideally, distinguish a Thought for the Day contributor from, say, Jacob Rees-Mogg.Actually, since the latter Brexit supporter is hardly less ostentatiously devout, is yet more ostentatiously fertile, is also hired by the BBC to troll its audience and believes – conclusive indicator of ine approbation – that women are designed for bottom-wiping, it seems almost unfair that he is not, like Fraser, invited to provide “reflections from a faith perspective on issues and people in the news”.Partly because they are subject to editorial control, and no doubt because they would like to be invited back, TFTD contributors generally refrain, in this slot, from the overtly prescriptive, preferring to agree with their own recycled platitudes: sometimes bad things happen money can’t buy happiness it’s good to talk. Alternatively: I saw a nice filmskypair of shoes recently it put me in mind of Jesusthe ProphetGuru Nanak.Traditionally, the Thoughts’ most resented quality was probably, as much as mistimed sanctimony, their banality. St Giles of the Changing Mat was not alone in saving more arresting observations for newspaper articles fellow contributor “historian and writer for the Daily ”, Tim Stanley, knows similarly when to maunder about Alan Partridge and when to declare for martyrdom. Catholics, Stanley has written, “should go on and on about abortion until they lock us up for it, which they may well do. It’s the right thing for the faith. It’s the right thing for society.” Though possibly not for reciting on the Today programme. For his part, fellow contributor chief rabbi Ephraim Mirvis has yet, I think, to share with Today listeners his opposition to female ordination.Render unto the Catholic Herald, the  – or Twitter – what is unsayable to a secular audience at 12 minutes to eight on what is advertised as a news and current affairs programme.Fraser’s latest expressions of enthusiasm for patriarchal arrangements, whether it’s his support for censorship in a girls’ faith school or tweeted nostalgia for pre-feminist times (“Don’t say stuck in the past. The past was better. Much better”), suggest that the principal problem with TFTD may be less, today, that it tests listeners’ endurance, more that its Thinkers insult their values. There was probably a time when much of his UK audience would have agreed, quite happily, with Fraser, that career women neglect their families, or with TFTD colleague, the bishop of Norwich, that marriage is for men and women only. But these, along with other cherished religious prejudices, have become ever more irreconcilable – when they are not transparently discriminatory – with evolving secular thinking, in a country where more than half have no faith.And whatever they might have to offer on topical issues, the very source of their speaking credentials surely renders many of these clerics if not actually unworthy of popular deference, no more obviously deserving than, say, the last black-cab operative who offered you his thoughts on women drivers. Accredited Anglican speakers still derive their authority, and thus their access to erse, BBC audiences, from a church that remains split on women’s ordination, and opposed to same sex marriages. Catholics, when lecturing the masses on niceness, now do so between headlines about their own church’s staggering moral failures. Notwithstanding the advance of virtuous journalists and spiritual randomers from the life-coach end of the TFTD talent pool, promotion within an established faith hierarchy remains the most reliable route to freelance preaching work, whether it’s in the House of Lords, on an independent commission or in defiance of the melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, on late-night news programmes.No sooner had his nappy meditation been eviscerated by women who both work and care for their elderly parents than our tireless Pampers Savonarola, Giles Fraser, was addressing us again, from Newsnight, albeit in the more humble, ecumenical style that once seemed to fit so well with  values. Was this why we never guessed that our own “Loose Canon”, who once excoriated his own church for promoting a cleric opposed to the ordination of women, would one day write: “It is the daughter of the elderly gentleman that should be wiping his bottom”? Also: “The attraction of socially conservative and traditional values are that they constitute a highly successful form of mutual care.”If only we’d paid heed, like Giles, to the past. We might have remembered this 18th-century refrain: “And this is law that I’ll maintain Until my dying day, sir, That whatsoever king shall reign, Still I’ll be Vicar of Bray, sir.”But it would be wrong to single out Fraser merely because, with the support of entranced progressives, he so often does so himself. His moral exhortations of a morning, evening or late evening – now that he reveals his patriarchal hankerings – are not necessarily more loathsome than those of more cautious colleagues. You can’t tell, from a brief, TFTD introduction, which of its Anglican bishops failed adequately to respond to allegations of sexual abuse, nor which of its regulars oppose same sex marriage, or deny women jobs or prosper by rarely mentioning that they consider homosexuality to be a sin.Moreover, faith professionals enjoy an exemption, under the Equality Act, allowing them to discriminate for spiritual purposes. But what is the BBC’s excuse?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1842a947c9fe94a681078ea19be34df6f5d4570b/0_24_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df31754eb60cba8f5dd99aa7f20ccef4","title":"tories islamophobia bigotry","story":"A litany of unpunished bigotry by MPs should perhaps be no surprise from a party which seems to attract anti-Muslim racistsOn Thursday’s BBC Politics Live show, the Conservative MP Henry Smith dismissed claims of Islamophobia in the Conservative party, citing the fact he personally had not seen any anti-Muslim discrimination.Yet we have a fair idea as to just how Islamophobia has taken hold among the party’s support base and how its leadership is responding to such attitudes.However, the latest statistics split by party preference show that there is a particular tendency for anti-Muslim racists to vote for the Conservative party, over and above others.One might have assumed that such a positive view about a widely reviled and hateful figure would not have any place in a modern Conservative party membership.But the problem seems to be far worse.The Conservative MP Bob Blackman retweeted an anti-Muslim post from Tommy Robinson, yet he did not even get a slap on the wrist from the party. In fact, depite having subsequently hosted anti-Muslim extremist in parliament (Tapan Ghosh), shared an Islamophobic story on Facebook, and been found as a member of a number of Islamophobic social-media groups, the party seems to have no real concern and the prime minister even chose to campaign with him.And I could go on – whether it is Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell’s Facebook account being found to have joined a “Free Tommy” group, or Conservative MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson meeting Steve Bannon, who famously praised Tommy Robinson as representing the working class. Johnson’s burqa comments have led to many claiming that he is using Islamophobia as part of a populist, Trump-like appeal to anti-Muslims in the party.Yet the party remains silent and believes it can get away with ignoring all those who say that action must be taken, whether it is senior Conservatives, Muslim representative groups, hundreds of mosques across the country, secular groups, women’s groups or national newspapers.Islamophobia is not just embedded in attitudes, it also finds expression in policy. For example, the party appears to ignore hate against Muslims in the wider society as well, with its hate crime action plan appearing to have made little progress on issues related to Muslims, quite powerfully demonstrated by the comparatively low funding going to mosques to support security, despite a rise in Islamophobic attacks. There are many who will say this is a clear indication of institutional Islamophobia – if not, how could a mayoral campaign built on racist tropes about Muslims have gained the support of the Conservative leadership, not to mention the active participation of Theresa May and David Cameron? And why would the former chair of the party, Baroness Warsi, say there is a “simmering underbelly of Islamophobia” in the party?The brilliant work of many Conservatives such as Dominic Grieve, Lord Bourne and James Brokenshire does not detract from the claim of a real and worrying structural problem.The right way to deal with the monumental weight of evidence would be for the Tories to launch an inquiry into all these accusations in an open, transparent and credible way.In 2019, surely that is not possible?• Miqdaad Versi is assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8004da69c15040307b08a70e9de04fba6e0771e3/0_58_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbbb7cb98a90ffa7e07550190fabcaf0","title":"three sundays to brexit cartoon","story":"As 29 March nears, fears rise over US demands for greater access to Britain’s supermarkets "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/499caa59c29af8ebf9cc82efee38be4b99339ddc/0_78_4945_2967/master/4945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088a65ca8e25709097336852cb6390de","title":"netflix languages education","story":"Amid concern over the fall in pupils studying foreign languages, a new online tool has turned the streaming service into a classroomFor years people around the world have learned English by watching Hollywood movies and costume dramas on the BBC. Now British monoglots have one less excuse for not returning the favour: a new online tool that turns the streaming service Netflix into a sofa-based language lab.Language Learning With Netflix (LLN), a tool that allows viewers to watch foreign language shows with subtitles both in the original language and English, and pauses automatically to allow the learner to absorb what they have just heard, has been downloaded by tens of thousands of people since its launch in December.Amid growing concern over the falling number of pupils taking foreign languages in secondary schools, some linguists have hailed LLN as a dynamic way of harnessing the educational potential of Netflix, which has programmes in 26 languages in 190 countries, and aims to have 100 non-English language series in production by this year.David Wilkinson and Ognjen Apic, the two independent developers behind the tool, began the project as a hobby a few years ago and launched their Chrome browser extension in December. A trickle of users has turned into a flood – in the last three weeks more than 30,000 people have downloaded the tool.“We want to encourage people to use good habits,” Wilkinson said. “At an early stage, students should listen to the language as much as possible. Pump language into the ears and provide a translation that allows you to associate meaning with that.”Wilkinson, who was born in Zimbabwe to English parents, began making his own materials seven years ago while learning Indonesian and Persian.“There’s probably three languages I use quite often – I kind of enjoy them: Farsi, Russian and Spanish. The others I don’t really use very much,” he said, adding that he does speak English “most days”. “I spent a lot of the time studying languages on my own but I made mistakes and I wasted a lot of time with methods which weren’t effective.”Wilkinson trained as a mechanical engineer before setting up a business selling bilingual books and started working on a precursor to LLN about three years ago. He discovered that Apic, a Serbian linguist, was doing the same thing, so they decided to team up. They picked Netflix because it offers such a wide range of shows in foreign languages, from the Italian crime drama Suburra: Blood on Rome to the Israeli political thriller Fauda via the Oscar-winning film Roma, set in Mexico City.LLN helps users absorb the language they are trying to learn by allowing them to view two translations simultaneously – an automatic, machine translation which tends to be literal, and an official version made by a person who understands idiom.But whether the tool can help reverse the longterm decline of foreign languages in British schools remains to be seen. Since 2004, foreign language GCSEs have been optional, and a BBC analysis published last week found that the numbers of children studying German and French had dropped by about two-thirds since then.Katharina von Ruckteschell-Katte, director of the Goethe-Institut in London, said making language more fun by using “fantastic” tools like LLN would help.“If I had had all these possibilities when I was young and learning French, Spanish and English I would have really loved it,” she said. “We at the Goethe-Institut, and all the institutions that teach foreign languages, do have this fear that in future all the robots will take over. I think it’s the other way around – we will still be teaching German, but we have to learn how to teach it together with these instruments.”“We know people already watch foreign language Netflix shows with subtitles to improve their listening comprehension,” Sam Dalsimer, Duolingo’s head of PR, said.“The LLN extension is a cool feature to enhance that experience. It seems primarily geared towards learners who have already acquired a decent baseline of vocabulary and grammar, and would be a great complement to learning with Duolingo.”Not everyone is convinced, however. “You can’t learn a language like this,” said Mickael Pointecouteau, course manager at the Alliance Française in London. “You need a real teacher to speak to, and to practise listening. It’s a bit passive and focuses only on one skill.”Wilkinson and Apic have ambitions to branch out to cover other platforms such as Amazon Video, but are currently fine-tuning the tool. They are adding an option to transliterate Japanese and Mandarin into Romanised subtitles and working on shows dubbed into different languages – the re-voiced scripts often do not directly match the subtitle translations of the original language.Languages to learn with NetflixBenvinguts a la família (Welcome to the Family) – a dark comedy about a family being evicted from their home.Bankier van het Verzet (The Resistance Banker) – a second world war film about the Dutch resistance.Kita Kita – a romantic comedy about a tour guide who goes blind after her fiance cheats on her.Andið eðlilega (And Breathe Normally) – a drama about the bond between a single mother and an asylum seeker.Radiopetti (Radio Set) – a drama about a partially deaf old man and the valve radio his father gave him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d2d8c310b68d0b4da1ac5cd77e8fe49d496d7aa/0_0_5793_3476/master/5793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4548890587275686995b0f282a2271b","title":"andreas kronthaler out of the shadows vivienne westwood paris","story":"It wasn’t the label’s classic protest-wear, but the British designer’s husband put together a quietly, subtly political collectionIn British fashion, you can’t move for sustainability as a reference point – not least with Vivienne Westwood, who has used the catwalk to monetise climate change, somehow without losing face.The good news for fans of her uniquely British eccentricity and famous corset dresses is that her business partner and husband, Andreas Kronthaler, has picked up that baton since taking her place at the helm of this label. And, on a damp Saturday afternoon during Paris fashion week, the Austrian delivered an autumn 2019 collection that was classic Westwood – with a does of environmental activism.Of course there were the enormous platforms, the ruched stockings, the bustier dresses. But there was also a message discreetly woven into the fabrics and prints, which were secondhand or carefully sourced.The show, which took place, inexplicably, in an airless conference room in the Hyatt hotel, opened with a yellow and black skirt suit made from fabric hand-printed in Burkina Faso and some house slippers made in Kronthaler’s home village of Erl. Then came Scottish tweed suits for the women, and oversized coats – inspired both by “Coco Chanel in fabric and “American football players” in silhouette – for men. There was a wedding dress for her and one for him: the sense of humour that brought us the chinchilla G-string in 1994 or the penis shoe in 1995 is still there. But they came after a segment of corseted dresses hoiked up so that flashes of bottom spilled over suspenders.It was not protest-wear as we know it – or as Westwood has previously created. At her most recent London show, she sent models down the catwalk wearing tabards with anti-consumerist and climate change slogans.“It’s slogan-free, none of that,” said Kronthaler, speaking backstage before the show began. “I don’t want to sound like Vivienne, and I’ve always cared: I’m just not that outspoken. I’m not the man on the barricade.”Instead he has repurposed items already in existence, such as a coat built from a 19th-century quilt found in a market, and a floral children’s bag turned into a T-shirt: in short, using the past to move into the future. If Westwood tends to deconstruct British history, and latterly has used her platform to proselytise somewhat, then Kronthaler’s approach feels more pragmatic.Still, it helps to consider why Kronthaler created the collection – “we’re being confronted with a bleak future” – and exactly how staging a catwalk show follows this gesture: “the solution is to reduce, make a smaller collection. There are only so many sweaters you can make.”Kronthaler describes the Vivienne Westwood show as “a résumé, a ‘who am I, Andreas?’”. It was only in March 2016 that his name was first added to the bill as an acknowledgement of his influence on the label for over 25 years.Westwood and Kronthaler met in 1989 at the Vienna School of Applied Arts, where she taught as a visiting professor. Kronthaler had created some dresses inspired by the renaissance Westwood invited him to develop them in London and by 1993 they were married.Sex and sustainability tend to make curious bedfellows. Still, sex sells and sustainability doesn’t, so why not combine the two? It’s already proved quite lucrative. Before last year, the company had a turnover of £37.5m.

A fifth straight league victory for Manchester City, courtesy of Riyad Mahrez’s second-half goal, means that Pep Guardiola’s side can enjoy the view from the top of the table while cranking up the pressure on their rivals. Liverpool face Everton at Goodison Park and will need to win if they want to regain top spot in a title race where there is so little margin for error.That is more of a compliment to City than a criticism of Bournemouth. Guardiola’s side passed the ball to death and were in so much control that is no exaggeration to say it seemed as though they had an extra two players on the pitch for much of the afternoon. “We played incredible, one of the best performances we’ve ever played,” Guardiola said.“We didn’t concede one shot on target. Every time we lost the ball we had three or four guys going to recover it. Bournemouth are incredibly well organised, with 11 players in the box, so there’s really no spaces – but we found them. We created a lot of chances. I don’t know what’s going to happen at the end of the season but these players deserve all my admiration and respect. Today was a special moment for all of us.”The only sour note for Manchester City was the sight of Kevin De Bruyne pulling up with a hamstring injury towards the end of the first half. De Bruyne knew immediately he had a problem and walked straight off the pitch before Mahrez, his replacement, had time to get his shirt on. “Kevin felt something in the hamstring. It’s normal, we’ve played 25 games in 93 days,” said Guardiola, who confirmed that his decision to withdraw John Stones early in the second half was more of a precaution because the defender felt a little bit of discomfort with the groin injury that has been troubling him recently.Guardiola acknowledged that the decisive goal was important for Mahrez as well as City. It was the club-record signing’s first in the league in almost three months and came on the back of a disappointing performance against West Ham in midweek, when he looked short of confidence and was substituted early in the second half.As with the 1-0 win over West Ham in midweek, this was a day when City needed to be patient, and that approach paid off 10 minutes into the second half.Oleksandr Zinchenko and David Silva swapped passes and then City got a little bit of luck when the ball fell kindly to the Spaniard after Charlie Daniels tried to make a challenge. David Silva shifted the ball on to Mahrez and the winger stabbed a low right-foot shot inside Artur Boruc’s near post.Underworked up until that stage, Boruc was about to get busy. Sterling was denied on a couple of occasions by the Bournemouth goalkeeper, who also pushed Sergio Agüero’s cross on to the bar and repelled Mahrez’s far-post header.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsIn truth, it was one-way traffic and the outcome was never in doubt from the moment Mahrez scored. “We were pleased with how we defended overall,” Howe said. “The only disappointment for me would be that their goal is probably the ugliest they will score this season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7eb91d11dabd7feb8fb55c74b83ac62872407c/0_131_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d658a804638844140be1b83333d2a15","title":"manchester united southampton premier league match report","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s 10th win in 12 Premier League games did not come without a scare – Manchester United trailed at the interval to Yan Valery’s stunning strike and had to overcome spirited resistance when Southampton fought back to 2-2 late in the second half – but two goals from a rejuvenated Romelu Lukaku kept their revival on the road.Paul Pogba missed the chance to give the scoreline a flattering gloss when he saw a stoppage-time penalty saved, though going down by four goals would have been very hard on a spirited Southampton. “Romelu is a quality striker with a goalscorer’s instincts,” Solskjær said. “He knows what he wants to do and he has the ability to deliver it.”Lukaku nevertheless needed time to warm up. United began as if they intended to have the game wrapped up by half-time and Southampton were indebted to Angus Gunn for three saves in the first six minutes that prevented the home side taking an early lead. The Saints goalkeeper tipped a Lukaku shot round a post, did well to react to a cheeky attempt from distance by Andreas Pereira and then saved at close range from Lukaku again when the striker should really have scored.After surviving that initial onslaught Southampton began to push their opponents back and grow into the game, gradually asserting authority over a fairly callow United midfield. They could have taken the lead after 12 minutes when Jannik Vestergaard climbed unchallenged to meet a James Ward-Prowse corner and headed wastefully over the bar, and might have had a penalty when Chris Smalling got away with a blatant tug on Ryan Bertrand’s shirt.In an effort to break the Southampton press Paul Pogba made a length-of-the-field break up the left, helped by Lukaku on the halfway line, but held on to the ball a fraction too long for his intended target Marcus Rashford to stay onside. Pogba was possibly at fault, however, when Southampton took the lead a few minutes later – at least, there was no one in his position on the left side of midfield when Charlie Austin found Valery in miles of space.Taking advantage of Luke Shaw backing off with his hands behind his back, the Southampton wing-back advanced a couple of paces before unleashing a ferocious shot that beat David de Gea from a good five yards outside the area. The goalkeeper managed to get hands to the ball but could not keep it out, only succeeding in pushing it into his top-left corner. It was the 20-year-old’s first goal in English football and he is unlikely to ever score a better one.When the already ineffective Sánchez departed injured five minutes into the second half it appeared United might be struggling for an attacking replacement when the full-back Diogo Dalot took his place. The opposite proved to be the case. With his first touch of the afternoon Dalot produced a cross to the far post from which Rashford should have hit the target, and with his second he teed up Pereira for the game’s second goal-of-the-month contender.The midfielder made the most of the space he was given to beat Gunn with a rising shot from just outside the area for his first Premier League goal, but what was noticeable was that Dalot had produced more in a couple of minutes than the laboured Sánchez had managed in almost an hour. Certainly either the equaliser or the substitution seemed to perk up the home side, for in another five minutes they were in front, Lukaku neatly eluding Jan Bednarek in the area to give himself room for a low shot beyond Gunn.Just for a moment it appeared United might overrun Southampton as the chances began to pile up at the Stretford End, but though they were stretched the visiting defence held out until the next spectacular goal arrived, courtesy of Ward-Prowse. There might have been some doubt over whether Ashley Young actually fouled Stuart Armstrong to give away a free-kick – it was more of a collision that left both players on the floor – but there was no debating the accuracy and power summoned by Ward-Prowse to beat De Gea from outside the area for a second time.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsWere points awarded for the quality of goals Southampton might not have left Old Trafford empty handed, though in reality United are always dangerous in the closing minutes of a game and the visitors paid the penalty for a late lapse of concentration when Lukaku was allowed to turn on the edge of the area to take a short pass from Fred. Though Gunn was beaten for a third time, he did manage to keep out Pogba’s penalty, awarded after Armstrong had fouled Rashford. It’s tough at the bottom but the Saints contributed greatly to an entertaining afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f3eec8e9c62ac6d7bf4aeeb76b8a2bde3909ec8/0_132_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e6c4d0536e3a8ae7adb5f91b4fa0383","title":"tottenham arsenal premier league match report","story":"On the finest of margins can matches – and even seasons – turn. Tottenham were labouring against their bitter rivals, seemingly out of ideas against an Arsenal team that led through Aaron Ramsey and had executed Unai Emery’s gameplan to the letter.Spurs were staring at a third consecutive Premier League defeat and the last time that happened was in 2012. The implications were grave. Mauricio Pochettino had conceded that the title was out of reach for his team after the losses at Burnley and Chelsea but another reverse would have imperilled their top-four hopes while simultaneously encouraging those of Arsenal.Then Christian Eriksen floated in a 73rd minute free-kick and everything changed. Harry Kane was in an offside position but, contentiously, it was not spotted. If the Spurs striker had not been ahead of the line, perhaps Shkodran Mustafi would not have felt the need to barge him. But he did and when the penalty was awarded Kane duly converted for his ninth goal in nine north London derbies.Spurs had their reprieve. Or did they? There was still time for another twist, another drama, after another penalty controversy. This time it was for Arsenal and in the 89th minute. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the substitute, had the position on Davinson Sánchez and, as the Spurs defender leaned in on him, there was a tussle.It was difficult to see what sent Aubameyang tumbling but the referee, Anthony Taylor, spotted something and he stunned the majority of the 81,332 crowd by pointing to the spot. Aubameyang addressed the kick and it stood to give Arsenal a sixth win in seven league games but, agonisingly for him, Hugo Lloris read his intentions and ed low to save. Lloris had made mistakes in the Chelsea defeat. Now he was the hero.There was more. When Alex Iwobi crossed from the rebound, Aubameyang looked set to tap into the empty net only for Jan Vertonghen to make a last-ditch slide challenge. Vertonghen had encroached deeply into the area on the penalty but he got away with it. Without that, would he have been able to make the tackle?It ended up as a hard luck story for Arsenal, who had felt that a first away league win over a big-six rival since January 2015 at Manchester City was on. Emery had asked his players to sit deep, stay behind the ball and tackle with everything they had, which they did – even if another substitute, Lucas Torreira, overstepped the mark at the very end. He was high and out of control when he crashed into Danny Rose to receive a straight red card.Then again, Rose had clattered into the Arsenal goalkeeper, Bernd Leno, on 68 minutes as he stretched for the ball inside the area with his studs up. He was given a yellow card. At the very end, Sánchez appeared to kick out at Laurent Koscielny. It was a game in which Taylor’s decisions came under an unforgiving spotlight and one that, in Emery’s opinion, showed why VAR will be introduced next season.“Today’s referees have big personality but it’s not enough to make the best decisions in the difficult actions in the box,” Emery said. “VAR is coming to help them. It’s positive for English football.”Arsenal’s run-in continues at home to Manchester United next Sunday but, that apart, it appears relatively kind. How different their situation would have looked with a victory here. The relief belonged to Spurs, who had started nervously and fallen behind to Ramsey’s goal.Pochettino drew attention to a cynical 12th-minute tackle from Granit Xhaka on Kane, which cut down the striker as he broke and was clearly worth a booking. Pochettino suggested that it could have been a red card and was the “turning point” of the game. That felt like a stretch.What shaped the game was Ramsey’s burst and finish on 15 minutes. Sánchez overcommitted to reaching a ball out of the Arsenal defence in front of Alexandre Lacazette and, when he missed it, his opponent sent Ramsey away. The Juventus-bound midfielder had the entire Spurs half into which to sprint and he rounded Lloris, held off Victor Wanyama and rolled home.Lacazette had snatched at a second-minute chance – he looked offside, although there was no flag – and there was a vulnerability about Spurs as they pressed high and left spaces in behind. Iwobi almost made them pay in the 42nd minute when he ran and curled for the far corner, but Lloris saved.Spurs made attacking inroads in the second half of the first period and they would have been level at the interval but for Leno’s marvellous double save from Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko. Kane had seen a header correctly ruled out for offside but Arsenal defended well both as a unit and in the one-on-ones. Sokratis Papastathopoulos was particularly impressive, and the clear man-of-the-match.Emery made bold decisions, chiefly the switch to a back four and the omissions of Mesut Özil and Aubameyang from the starting lineup. He was vindicated. “I’m proud of the players,” Emery said. “It was about playing like a team, feeling together. We could have won.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsSpurs had too many players who were below their best. Kieran Trippier sank to his knees after overcooking one cross for Son Heung-min while at the other end, he struggled to contain the impressive Iwobi. Eriksen’s sights were awry and Wanyama looked like a player who had not started a game since 10 November. It felt incongruous to hear Pochettino say that Spurs “were better in all aspects”.Lacazette side-footed wide on 56 minutes from Nacho Monreal’s cut-back and Arsenal were comfortable Spurs desperate. But Pochettino and his players would find a way back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b581b96b51342df70062a5116d2f70266e5b9f6/0_73_2136_1282/master/2136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bfae67ae4f3c69cf498c640a03e181f","title":"tottenham hotspur brittle top four mauricio pochettino arsenal","story":"By any reasonable measure Mauricio Pochettino’s side proved themselves up to the task by clawing back an ugly point from an Arsenal side playing more than ever in Unai Emery’s imageIt’s happened again, it’s happened again. Oh, Tottenham Hotspur. The harvesting of enough points to guarantee another season of Champions League football ahead of less frugal rivals: it’s happening again.On a mild north London afternoon Tottenham scragged their way to a bitty 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Wembley. For Spurs it felt like something more significant, an ugly point gained from behind, while playing for much of the afternoon with a ragged, brittle, angsty edge.It was a point to prevent a poor week becoming a desperate one. Beyond that it was an unfortunate turn of events for those keen to riff on that narrative of Spursiness, of annual chokes and chuckings-in, of a basic weakness of spirit.In reality this was a heartening display for Tottenham’s supporters, a game dragged back while half the team played below itself, and with a central midfielder in Victor Wanyama who seemed unable to fulfil any part of the brief – passing, covering, even running around looking purposeful – with any real success. It was a point that left Mauricio Pochettino happy to chat in a fond, rambling way through his press conference. It is not hard to see why. For Pochettino, the season never actually boiled down to a battle to finish in the top four. It was always a battle to finish in the top four, one that is back on track now, with the added bonus of a likely passage to the Champions League quarter-finals thrown in.Against this Tottenham are, for reasons that remain unclear, the most widely chastised of the Premier League’s high-achievers. There has always been a certain jeering unease in the top flight towards a refusal to spend money, the kind of response you might expect in some sweaty, booze sodden Friday night saloon bar as you sidle up to order your third Orangina of the night.The urge to cast shade on this fine footballing project is evidence of how simplistic the narrative around football can be. Chuck in the reliance on coaching and youth systems - Spurs spent £18m net in the past five seasons – and it is either idiocy or mischief to conclude Pochettino has done anything other than an excellent job.But then, we live in a time of inane hyperbole generally, a world of GOATs and frauds, of half-understood extremes. In reality most things that happen, happen somewhere in the middle shades of red and green. This was one of those games, and a result with much to commend itself for both teams.Wembley was unusually boisterous at kick-off. It is a perfect stage for a game like this, offering just the right sense of grand neighbourly ceremony for a game that sucks in a huge northern swathe of this tightly-packed city.With Harry Winks injured Pochettino fielded his most muscular XI, with five beefy looking units across the middle of the field. And yet for an hour in mid-afternoon this did look like a choke in action, nine points dropped in a week, another nail in that hastily erected notion of sclerotic white-shirted collapse.In reality Arsenal played well, looking more than ever like an Unai Emery team. The starters made 16 successful tackles in the first half alone. Nobody passed the ball that well. Nobody kept possession for the sake of it. But Arsenal looked like a team.The opening goal was superbly taken by Aaron Ramsey, and also an embarrassment for Tottenham’s defensive block. With 14 minutes gone a punted clearance reached the centre circle. Davinson Sánchez stooped to head the ball with all the conviction of an arthritic horse dipping its head to drink from a stream.Alexandre Lacazette played an instant pass in behind into ... well, what exactly? How is it possible, you wondered, to retain such a vast green space behind your own defence, such rolling pampas, such a savannah, despite fielding five defenders and two deep midfielders? Ramsey took the ball on, held off Wanyama and finished well.The equaliser came from a moment of luck. Harry Kane was pushed in the back by Shkodran Mustafi as he ran in behind him on to Christian Eriksen’s free-kick. But Kane was offside when the kick was taken, and offside enough to get ahead of the player who fouled him,There was no doubt about the kick itself. Kane is a wonderfully vicious striker of a dead ball, hungry to get to the spot, relishing the feel of the ball. Arsenal should have won it from a soft penalty of their own given for a minor jostle on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. His kick was weak Hugo Lloris got down well to save it.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsAnd so both of teams rolled on, buoyed by a point, and both a little closer to a final league place that would represent – with apologies all round – a level of sober, non-sensational, but still significant success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea1583a57d3c793765bc386248bb8c1305ad73a/0_0_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18d10f3a422038f677b2b9522c4cc844","title":"real madrid v barcelona el clasico live","story":"Messi goes down holding his face after a collision with the inevitable Sergio Ramos. He is absolutely furious! Ramos won the ball off Messi and smacked him in the face with his forearm at the same time. Had it been anyone else I would be 100 per cent sure it was an accident. In this case I’m 98 per cent sure Ramos knew what he was doing. When Messi eventually gets up, he squares up to Ramos, and the players on both sides have a full and frank exchange of views as they walk off at half-time. The second half should be fun, eh.45 min A half-chance for Madrid. Casemiro curls a long, high pass down the right to Carvajal, who heads the ball back across goal towards Modric. He gets in front of Pique and heads over 12 yards. 44 min “Coutinho is a different type of player to Iniesta,” says Niall Mullen. “He’s best as a wide forward in a front three. I hope that Barca are not trying to replace their legendary players like for like because they may have a little trouble replacing their number 10 when he eventually goes.”43 min Vinicius Junior cuts infield from the left and has a pop at goal. Throw-in to Barcelona.41 min Messi is fouled by Ramos, a sly one that probably deserved a yellow card.39 min: Vital save from Courtois! The excellent Rakitic burst forward in the inside-right channel and played a square pass to Suarez just outside the D. He allowed it to run across his body, beating Varane in the process, before drilling a low left-footed shot that was excellently stopped by Courtois, ing low to his left. Courtois got straight to his feet to grab Messi’s follow-up as well.39 min “They used to chant ‘Sumo! Sumo!’ for Micky Quinn,” says Niall Mullen. “When they do it for Messi he responds ‘Si, naranja por favor’.”37 min Messi curls a free-kick a few yards wide from 20 yards. This is looking ominous for Real, with Barcelona starting to pick them off on the counter-attack.36 min Suarez appeals for a handball by Carvajal in the Real area. The ball did hit his outstretched hand but he was approximately 0.00004 yards away when Suarez lobbed the ball over his shoulder.35 min “Does anyone who watches Barcelona regularly have thoughts on why Valverde wouldn’t play Coutinho in the middle of the park in the Iniesta role as God and whoever is in charge of transfers at the club have clearly intended?” wonders Phil Podolsky. “Is the all-round contribution of Rakitic and the other one preferable to the attacking genius of the Brazilian? I typed all this before the goal, mind.”I’d have Rakitic over Coutinho most days. I haven’t seen enough of Arthur to disparage him on the internet, though.33 min Rakitic plays a clever angled through ball that is just too far in front of Messi. He would have been through on goal.32 min A Real corner is half cleared by Barcelona to Reguilon, who hammers the bouncing ball just wide from 25 yards. Ter Stegen must have been unsighted because he didn’t move.31 min Modric wins the ball on the edge of the Barcelona with a storming tackle on Jordi Alba. He springs to his feet and drives a low cross that pinballs around the area before Barcelona clear.30 min Reguilon es into the area after a tackle from Arthur. The referee doesn’t buy it.29 min Bale’s deep cross is put behind for a corner by Lenglet. Comes to nowt.Rakitic played a short pass out to Sergi Roberto on the right and ran onto the return pass, away from the last defender Ramos. Once he was into the area he sat Courtois down and dinked the ball gently, almost goadingly, over him and into the net.Barcelona take the lead with a delicious goal!24 min “If you watch Messi he actually just walks a lot during the game, as we have been told by stats already,” says Ruth Purdue. “But when he comes alive he 25 yards from goal he just bursts into life. A joy to watch. I guess age comes to us all, and he lets everyone else run for him. Genius.”Micky Quinn did something similar at Coventry.22 min Vinicius Junior stabs the ball cockily over the sliding Pique and charges down the left. He gets into the area and cuts the ball back to Benzema, who moves it on to Modric. He dummies to pass and then hits a low shot from 15 yards that is kicked away on the six-yard line by Pique, who seconds earlier had been put on his backside on the left wing by Vinicius.19 min: Messi misses a good chance! Suarez lobbed a loose ball over the defence to Messi, who took it down with his chest, or maybe his right bicep, and moved into the area. As Courtois came out, Messi lobbed the ball over him with the outside of his left foot, but he got too much on it and it drifted past the far post.19 min This is a good spell from Barcelona, who are into their stride after a fairly slow start. Messi looks particularly dangerous.17 min Carvajal tries to kick Messi and ends up on his arse.16 min Vinicius beats a couple of defenders with ease but overhits his through pass to Bale. That was a chance for Real.15 min Courtois makes a brilliant save from Suarez’s vicious hit, although it wouldn’t have counted because of an offside in the build-up.14 min A ludicrous 60-yard pass from Messi releases Dembele, whose first-time cross is put behind for a corner.13 min Varane’s fierce shot on the turn is blocked by Lenglet and rebounds to Kroos, whose deflected long-range shot is well held by ter Stegen. 11 min A good move from Barcelona. Messi combines with Jordi Alba and finds Dembele. He plays a cute reverse pass to release Jordi Alba, whose driven cross is put behind for a corner. It’s played short and eventually slid into the area towards Rakitic, who goes down hoping for a penalty. The referee isn’t interested.10 min Reguilon plays a sharp pass into Benzema, who wriggles away from Lenglet on the edge of the area before dragging a left-footed shot well wide of the far post.9 min Nothing to report in the last few minutes. Real look bright and busy in possession.5 min A lazy, ill-conceived flick from Casemiro is intercepted by Rakitic, who shovels the ball forward to Messi. He slides a through pass towards Suarez, and Varane comes between Suarez and Courtois to concede a corner.4 min It’s been a good start from Real, who are pressing with intent when they don’t have the ball.3 min Bale blooters the free-kick high over the bar.2 min Modric nicks the ball off Busquets near the halfway line and finds Kroos. He surges to within 20 yards of goal before being taken down by Busquets, who is booked.1 min Peep peep peep! Barcelona get the match under way, kicking from right to left if you like to picture these things.The Eleven Sports coverage is, erm, eccentric.

Luis Suarez, who has taken over from Lionel Messi as Madrid’s chief pain in the derriere, scored twice in that game to go with a hat-trick in the season’s first clasico, when Barcelona plugged Real 5-1 in October. Real’s defenders must be thrilled to be facing those two again so soon after Wednesday.Real are nine points behind Barcelona with 13 games remaining, so a point is of precisely no use to them.

It wasn’t a great game, with Newcastle in particular decidedly sub-par. They are 14th tonight, five places and eight points below the Hammers, and six points above the bottom three. With 31 points to their name already a couple more wins should see them safe, but they will have to improve on this performance if they are to get them. West Ham didn’t play as well as they can, but then did they have to – though Diop in particular made a series of Benítez-frustrating blocks. Bye!Rafa Benítez does some chatting:We had 17 attempts, and I think they were lucky in some of the situations when they were blocking our shots. Both goals were poor. These mistakes against these teams, when they have so much quality in attack, then you pay for that.You have to credit their defenders. There were two or three occasions when they blocked the shot. In a normal game it would be a clear chance. When you go away and you have 17 attempts, you have to score at least one goal.We are doing a lot of goo things but we have to keep the focus and the concentration from the first minute until the last minute, and we didn’t do it. We had good situations in the first half, but we were 2-0 down already. We have to be sure that we learn from these mistakes and we are ready for the next game.He says Longstaff has a problem with his knee, which forced his substitution.Here’s Nick Ames’ match report from the London Stadium:West Ham’s supporters came in homage to Billy Bonds, around 20,000 of them taking their seats in the stand that was named after him in a stirring ceremony before kick-off. They left basking in the most routine of victories and enjoying an apposite reminder that their club still produces heroes through the generations.Declan Rice set them on their way against a dreary Newcastle with a header that Bonds would have admired and embellished his soaring reputation throughout. Mark Noble, a captain who strives to mould himself in Bonds’ image, added a penalty and it capped a game that, for one day at least, captured West Ham’s past and present in perfect harmony.Much more here:And Mark Noble also has a chat:For us the three points were massive. That’s all we were thinking about during the week. If you look at this season, our home results have been really good. We just seem to play well here. The fans are behind us now, I think everyone’s happy where they’re sat in the ground, and the fans appreciate what we’re doing out on the green.It’s a great balance because you’ve got Snods who works so hard for the team, myself and Dec who balance it out, and then Manu and Felipe who create some special moments for us. Manu, he’s been out seven months and he looked really good tonight. We’ve got a great squad at the minute. The goal was massive. It was nice to get on the scoresheet again. This season we’ve made it tough at times for teams to come here and play. With Wolves winning today it’s important that we keep pushing. 90+3 mins: West Ham have won this game of football!90+2 mins: And Rondon didn’t hit the post with that free-kick – his shot was excellently saved by a ing Fabianski!90 mins: Save! Masuaku’s cross is intercepted but Arnautovic immediately wins it back and knocks it back to Lanzini, whose curler from 20 yards is well aimed but saved!89 mins: Now Newcastle can try to score from a free kick, and Diop goes into the book for conceding it. Rondon takes it … and hits the base of the post!86 mins: Snodgrass curls the free kick way over the bar.85 mins: Diamé nibbles at Lanzini’s ankles 25 yards from goal, and is booked. Though Sky say it was Dubravka who was booked, for protesting too loudly.84 mins: Felipe Anderson intercepts a pass in midfield and runs to the edge of the penalty area before passing inside to Lanzini, off whom the ball breaks to Snodgrass, who tries to backheel it into the net but, well, doesn’t.82 mins: Nearly an attacking-style thing for Newcastle. Atsu’s low cross picks out Rondon, but Ogbonna throws out a leg to block his shot.81 mins: A clever turn from Lanzini inside Newcastle’s penalty area allows him to move away from two defenders, and straight into two different ones.80 mins: West Ham call it a standing ovation, and it might indeed have been so. I’m not there to see. On TV it sounded like a smattering of polite applause emanating from the few members of the audience yet to slip into a coma.79 mins: Christian Atsu replaces Isaac Hayden for Newcastle, and West Ham bring on Obiang for Noble, thereby ending the evening’s substitutional activity.77 mins: it doesn’t help that the crowd appear to have gone to sleep, as if they were making some noise it might stop some viewers noticing how poor this match has been.74 mins: Newcastle have pushed more players forward since bringing Dummett on, which means that though their attacks continue to be basically hopeless, they are at least less undermanned.71 mins: Arnautovic might have scored with his first touch, but he can’t get enough contact onto Lanzini’s rabona scross.70 mins: West Ham make a second change: Hernández goes off, and Arnautovic comes on.68 mins: Fabianski executes a fancy spin to turn away from Perez, earning a roar from the crowd.67 mins: Newcastle win a corner and Masuaku wins a booking, for no obvious reason. Ritchie once again picks out a West Ham player, Fredericks actually having duck to head clear under no challenge inside the area. 66 mins: Felipe Anderson has gone on a couple of tasty dribbles in the last few minutes, suggesting he may turn up for the last half-hour.65 mins: Newcastle make their second substitution, bringing Paul Dummett on for Fabian Schär.62 mins: And another one! Masuaku floats the ball into the area where it drops nicely for Hernández, but once he controls it he’s almost at the byline, and his shot was never going in.59 mins: A half-chance for West Ham! Two Newcastle players get in each other’s way on the halfway line allowing Fredericks to scamper down the right, and Hernández stretches to get a foot to his cross but can’t control his shot.58 mins: A Newcastle throw-in is flicked by Hayden to Rondon, whose shot from a tight angle is a) Newcastle’s first effort on target and b) useless, and easily saved. I’m getting a bit grumpy about Newcastle now.57 mins: West Ham then go down the left and a low cross seems destined for one of two attackers on the far side of the area, only for Lejeune to fly into the picture at the last moment and get in the way.56 mins: Manquillo cuts in from the right and runs towards the centre, where two attackers stay entirely still. He keeps running until the three of them are basically standing on each other’s toes, and they give the ball away.53 mins: Ritchie’s corner is headed clear. His deliveries have been disappointing so far this evening.52 mins: Newcastle probe their way around the midfield, before Ritchie’s cross is deflected behind for a corner.48 mins: A chance for Newcastle! Perez pokes the ball to Rondon, gets it back, bursts into the penalty area and from near the right-hand corner of the six-yard box drags his shot across goal and wide!46 mins: Peeeeep! West Ham get the second half under way.The players are back out. Newcastle need no so much an improvement as a total transformation, but stranger things have happened. They will start the half with Diamé on the pitch, and Longstaff off it.45+6 mins: And that’s the last meaningful action of the half! West Ham have never been much better than OK, but Newcastle have been terrible and deservedly trail.45+5 mins: Newcastle win another corner, and this is played in nicely by Ritchie but onto Diop’s head. His clearance is headed back into the box where Perez briefly looks to be clear, but Diop pops up again to put the fire out!45+2 mins: Rice finds Masuaku on the left with a nice, quick pass, and he centres for Hernandéz, whose attempted backheel finish finds only a defender’s leg.45+1 mins: Snodgrass dances around the right wing for a while, bamboozling several Newcastle players, and is finally brought down by Almiron. Felipe Anderson’s free kick is rubbish, and cleared.45 mins: What with a goal, a penalty and a couple of injury stoppages, there will be five minutes of stoppage time.The referee stops Noble mid run-up to deal with some encroachment the West Ham captain retreats to its start and then hammers his spot-kick into the top left corner. Unstoppable!The free kick floats to Hernandez, who controls and heads for goal Lejeune slides in and clips his ankle, and that is a penalty!39 mins: Snodgrass and Longstaff commit to winning the same 5050 ball, 10 yards outside Newcastle’s penalty area. Longstaff got the ball but also quite a lot of man, and is booked (personally I think Snodgrass cannot have gone for that ball without knowing the certain repercussions, and didn’t see a bookable offence).37 mins: Lanzini shoots into the wall, and then takes the ball back from Snodgrass but this time curls the ball over everyone and out of play for a goal kick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b3a9847ac4ba0c197445b064dc9bb5d372e384b/0_0_5559_3336/master/5559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e21b17dbe70f6e5427187d10b16d7ac","title":"apprenticeships should be used to improve equality","story":"Employers need to reserve places on apprenticeship schemes for young women, disabled people and ethnic minorities to create a more level playing field, the country’s equality body has said.With National Apprenticeship Week starting on Monday, the Equality and Human Rights Commission says firms need to take steps to get more people from minority groups into trainee schemes, favouring them against other similarly qualified candidates if necessary.Few employers are making use of powers given to them under the 2010 Equality Act to tackle disadvantage and under-representation experienced by certain groups, according to a report by the commission, the University of Chester and the Young Women’s Trust. “Women continue to be shut out of key parts of the economy due to outdated gender stereotypes and a lack of support,” said Dr Carole Easton, the trust’s chief. “We need a level playing field in the workplace for women, disabled people and ethnic minorities,” said Rebecca Hilsenrath, the commission’s chief executive. “If we can do this at the point of entry to the labour market, we will take giant steps towards closing pay gaps and eliminate the outdated idea that certain kinds of people ought to be doing certain kinds of jobs.”But the commission warns that too many companies “are hesitant about using positive action because they’re worried about inadvertently discriminating against others”. Last week Cheshire police were found guilty of discriminating against a white, heterosexual 25-year-old man because it used positive action in an unlawful way. Matthew Furlong, 25, applied to join the service in 2017 but lost out to other candidates. An employment tribunal found Furlong had been discriminated against on the basis of his sexual orientation, race and sex.The commission said ignorance of the law was holding back some employers in opening up apprenticeships to minorities. “Employers need to take a confident and pro-active approach if they are really going to make a difference here,” Hilsenrath said. “Unfortunately employers such as Cheshire police falling foul of the law due to a lack of understanding add to this fear. In reality, when used correctly, positive action is a powerful way for employers to address skills shortages and foster inclusive and erse working environments that allow everyone to reach their full potential.”The report calls on employers to reserve places for certain groups and provide mentoring to them. It also wants a candidate from a minority group favoured if there is a “tie-in” with a candidate from a non-minority group.“Used appropriately and robustly, positive action can provide a vitally effective means of tackling disadvantage and under-representation, but unfortunately, there is little practical evaluation of the use of positive action in apprenticeships or in wider employment,” said Professor Chantal Davies at the University of Chester.The number of apprenticeships in England pledged by next year Women make up only one in 20 new apprentices in building and planning "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7164dd5e76fb467c2823b0560936112d06786833/0_184_5843_3506/master/5843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0286c0a4d8208a77acf62f22430e5d69","title":"treasured island a family adventure on the isle of man","story":"With everything from goat walking and gorge scrambling to sunsets, scallops and Viking kings, the Isle of Man is an outdoor playground, as Rhonda Carrier and family discoveredThe boys are buzzing, grinning from ear to ear I haven’t seen them so excited in ages. I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash. This circular stone-and-glass cafe was designed to take full advantage of the glorious views of the sunsets and the seals that bob amid the rocks below. We watch in wonder, feasting on local seafood such as Manx queen scallops cooked with bacon, garlic and lashings of butter.Other favourite eateries during our stay include Ballacregga Corn Mill tearooms – beside the island’s iconic Great Laxey Wheel, the largest working waterwheel in the world – where scallops come as part of a ine fish chowder, and the Creek Inn on the quayside at Peel.Heading back to the ferry at Douglas we also discover hip North Quay, where we have a last treat of piri-piri chicken and milkshakes at the Barbary Coast Grill \u0026amp Bar and stock up on fresh-from-the-oven sourdough bread at Noa Bakehouse. Pulling out of port, kids little and large agree that we’ve hardly scratched the surface of this high-octane island, and that it will be only a matter of time before we’re back onboard the boat to Douglas.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin.

After graduating, they worked from their kitchen in Brixton but, with the arrival of their second child, they decided to move. “We both grew up in rural places so we wanted to escape the city and be nearer to the beach. Emma’s from this area and we fell for this village because of the lovely school, and made our plans around that,” says Anthony.For the first 10 years they lived in a cottage, on the look-out for a good piece of land for a self-build. They also began to covet this Victorian granary that had been converted into a house. “We loved that mix of industrial and domestic,” Anthony says. They were less thrilled by the interior. “It had been converted in the 70s in a not very imaginative way – it’s an agricultural building but it had been ‘country-cottaged’,” Anthony says.While some creative couples might prefer to manage without an architect, this pair could see the value of bringing in the pros: “Architects are brilliant at things like spatial awareness, creating beautiful sight lines and they are meticulous about the details,” Emma says.They had their perfect architects waiting in the wings: Nick and Rosamund England of England Architecture, recommended by friends and based in nearby Rye and south London. “We share a passion for Modernist buildings and love their ideas and aesthetic,” smiles Anthony. “There was such a good connection that we had a lot of meetings that were an excuse for lunch and a glass of wine as well as making plans.”The couple didn’t want to be shackled to any preconceived ideas of what a country home should look like. “We were inspired by the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth Gallery in Somerset, that mix of architecture and farmyard and garden. We wanted clean, open space and lots of light,” Emma says. The architects guided them to a simple layout, with a large kitchen-dining room at the centre of the house. “It works really well with teenage kids because it’s open plan so we feel more connected to them,” says Anthony.To preserve the proportions of the main space, the kitchen itself consists of one monolithic island, topped with white marble. And rather than boxy stairs, the architects designed the open steel staircase, built for them by a local farmer friend with a side-line in metalwork.The dining area opens on to the living room, which was added on in the 70s. Now it’s clad with long horizontal boards of Douglas fir which has weathered to a beautiful silver-grey, while a wall of glass opens on to a deck and replaces the twee French doors. England Architecture created as many windows as they could get through planning approval, to frame the views of the countryside. To avoid competing with these views, the couple painted every room white and introduced colour through art and objects.They are drawn to midcentury pieces, many of them found in the junk and antique shops of nearby Rye: “We like the simplicity but also the quirky nature of this era,” says Emma. Their home is also peppered with colourful pieces of ceramic and glass from the 60s and 70s. “We love the unique, hand-crafted nature of these pieces, the eye-popping colours and geometric op-art designs.” Anthony agrees. “I made a poster that said ‘want better, not more!’ and I think that’s really important – have less stuff but choose things that will last a lifetime.”A separate work studio adjoins the house: “Work and home life have always been connected for us,” says Anthony. His work takes a traditional approach to printmaking and typography, but uses the techniques in a modern way. He has just produced a book, Look and See, and a limited-edition acid house vinyl record, and is currently getting ready for a new craft biennale at Harewood House near Leeds. In the exhibition, UsefulBeautiful, Burrill’s thought-provoking messages will stand in a Robert Adam-designed hall alongside Chippendale furniture and Jacob Epstein sculpture. Perhaps Burrill’s enduring appeal lies in the humour and positivity behind his simple messages, qualities which are valuable in challenging times.Emma has left photography behind and gardening is her passion now. She’s a volunteer gardener at the renowned Great Dixter and helped build a show garden at last year’s RHS Chelsea. Her spare time is spent carving a garden out of their own seven-acre plot. “There are always more projects to do here,” she says, “but we’re not in a hurry. It feels like we’re going to be here for ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c2e9de195afd8b588600a971385c92c5e000e99/0_2200_4291_2574/master/4291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=684c21fdb35adcb063eed15e220a8484","title":"how we live together three generations under one roof","story":"Three generations under one roof: how’s that working out?As a single parent, I couldn’t get a mortgage.

But, eventually, restlessness kicks inSnuggled up in bed, my son is squished between me and my partner, my daughter is curled up in a corner, having stolen my pillow, and our big black fluffy cat is purring and walking across the lot of us, searching for an empty spot to lie down in. For 10 whole minutes it’s a blissful, cosy start to the day. Nobody needs to rush to work or school, so we have rare time together to chat and laugh in the dim light of the morning. Then my son’s hungry stomach rumbles, the cat digs his claws into my partner and the magic is broken. It’s still only 6.30am. There’s no rest for the wicked – or parents it seems – so I take my moments of calm where I can.Making a big pot of porridge for the family breakfast feels like instant cosiness at very little cost. Stirring the oats with a wooden spoon is hypnotically soothing and the sound of it bubbling gently, mixed with the enticing smell of warm porridge, gets everyone round the table faster than you can say Goldilocks. Each of us has our own favourite topping – maple syrup, bananas, cinnamon, pumpkin seeds – and we start the day full, warm and happy.For us, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in our pyjamas. All the usual rules about being tidy and quiet go out the window and my eight-year-old’s Beanos, Michelle Obama’s autobiography and my 10-year-old’s latest Jacqueline Wilson book are strewn around as we compete noisily at Connect 4 and Cluedo. There are happy winners and defiant losers but spirits remain surprisingly high as we all take turns DJing from our Spotify playlists. The morning passes to an eclectic mix of The Greatest Showman, Little Mix and Christine and the Queens.Eventually, restlessness kicks in and we pile on our clothes, boots, hats, scarves and gloves and head outside for a boredom-beating walk. Within minutes the kids have, of course, pulled off their hats, scarves and gloves (they have that enviable childhood power of not feeling the cold), dropped the football they’re carrying and asked if we’re nearly there yet, but we’re all still feeling pretty content as we head for the nearest wide open space. For big walks and dog-watching we go to Hampstead Heath, for a stroll through a farmers’ market we choose Alexandra Palace, or for impressive den-building sticks we head to Highgate Wood. The dens usually start out as half-hearted lean-tos made from a bunch of weedy twigs, but once we all get involved and uncover hefty fallen branches, they transform into Grand Designs-style creations that should probably have planning permission.I’ve learnt the hard way that outdoor family peace depends on having food supplies available at all times. To make sure I don’t end up wasting money on overpriced snacks, I have a flask of hot chocolate and some apples handy in case there are any sudden meltdowns by the kids (or the adults).When the cold finally starts to bite and tiredness creeps up on us, we head off to meet our friends for a pub lunch. Is there anything cosier than walking into a welcoming pub with a roaring fire in the middle of winter? We’re not fans of a formal, heavy Sunday roast instead we’ll share a selection of starters and tuck into something spicy and light for our main course. The children are happy with anything as long as it involves chips. The adults chat and catch up over a bottle of malbec, while the kids muck around and play games on their phones together. It’s a stress-free chance to relax and recharge, then it’s all back to ours for coffee and cake. It’s just the best way to spend quality time with loved ones and fend off any thoughts of Monday’s back-to-work-and-school blues.In the evening, it’s the four of us again, back in our pyjamas and settled down for a movie. The heating’s down low to save on costs and our sofa becomes a nest of cushions and thick, comfy blankets as we get sucked into the world of Fantastic Beasts, Minions or The Incredibles and share a bowl of homemade popcorn.Bedtime for the children comes once they start yawning, and I’ll read them a chapter of Harry Potter or How to Train Your Dragon before tucking them into bed. The lights are low and our voices are quiet, but as we share the adventures of whichever story we’re reading I know that these tranquil moments of togetherness are the ones that will stay with me.Finally, I head for my room and pick something to read from the stack beside my bed. My phone is off, our home is quiet and the cat is back and purring by my feet. It’s the calmest of ends to the cosiest of days.Download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.

In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

Existing members “would rather had have a rattlesnake than me”, Nancy Astor reflected. Women in the chamber threatened the cosy club that had existed for several hundred years.My new book, Women of Westminster, tells the story of what women in parliament have achieved. Issues such as child benefit, abortion, equal pay, maternity leave, Sure Start, action against sexual harassment and more found a sisterhood of cheerleaders in female MPs.But I was also struck when researching the history by the focus, since day one, on how female MPs dressed – so often used to trivialise or objectify. But female MPs have also used fashion and appearance to tell us something about them and their politics, often to great effect.It was inevitable that women would stand out. In 1919, men wore morning suits in the chamber. So the question of what to wear was one of many Astor had to contemplate as she travelled by train from Plymouth to take her seat. Her decisions set a precedent – and something for her female successors to emulate or rebel against. In a black two-piece suit, white silk blouse, tricorn hat and white gardenia in her buttonhole, Astor dressed as if going to church “in her Sunday best”.For the first female MPs, clothing posed a dilemma. If they dressed too formally, they were called sexless bluestockings if they wore eyecatching or feminine outfits, they were trivialised and condescended to.Some female MPs, including Astor, consciously eschewed fashion or femininity. Susan Lawrence, elected for Labour in 1923, asked a department store to send half-a-dozen inexpensive dresses to her office, “briefly raising her head from her papers to select one by pointing with a pencil”.But other women embraced the difference. Liberal MP Lady Vera Terrington said the assumption that she should wear a “dull little frock with a Quaker collar”, was “all humbug”. Labour firebrand Ellen Wilkinson loved colourful clothing and ignored Astor when she implored her to dress more soberly.When Jennie Lee was elected in 1929 at the age of 24, the press regularly focused on her clothing. One newspaper said she took “the Speaker’s breath away”, with “the assurance of a Bond-Street mannequin” as she walked into the chamber in a bright green dress “of the clinging variety”.There was also the “hat question”. The convention in public meetings was that women showed respect by being covered, and men by being uncovered. Before Astor took her seat, the Times speculated: “No doubt she will wear her hat in the House, as she would do in a church or chapel.” But, it asked, “If she wears a hat, should she remove it when she rises to speak, as male MPs are bound to do?” It was a dilemma, permeated with annoyance at the rules of the chamber being challenged by the inappropriate presence of women. A  headline screamed, “Hat Problem Still Unsolved”.It remained unsolved into the 1920s: in 1925, Wilkinson was criticised for not wearing a hat when addressing the speaker. In 1929, Lawrence’s usual sobriety saw a brief interlude when, wishing to speak but having no hat, she placed an order paper over her head. The speaker ruled that in future women could remain uncovered when speaking in the chamber. The hat problem, at least, was settled.Even in 1945, when the number of female MPs swelled to 24, they were still a novelty. When Labour’s Jean Mann rose to ask a question, members whispered that she was “dressed like a bride”. And when Wilkinson, as minister of education in 1945, was answering questions at the dispatch box wearing a green-feathered hat, she was greeted by opposition jeers.Labour’s Barbara Castle actively cultivated a housewife-superstar aesthetic, and was once interviewed at home in her pink mules, long cigarette holder poised in manicured hands. “Plums don’t fall into plain girls’ laps,” she once declared. She defied the convention that redheads should wear quiet colours, sporting bright red dresses and ostentatious jewellery as well as going to the hairdresser’s twice weekly.This persona served Castle well, solidifying her status as the most famous female MP of the era – and at that stage probably of all time – with speculations that she could become the first woman prime minister. But it also meant she was at times treated with derision and suspicion. One cabinet colleague alleged that “she only has to waggle that bottom of hers and she gets it all her own way” with prime minister Harold Wilson. Castle did not make it to the very top, but the first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, replicated Castle’s style. Well-coiffured hair, bright blue suits and of course the handbag were Thatcher’s trademark – a source of both appeal and caricature.When the now Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, was first elected in 1982, she was sworn in, heavily pregnant, in a red velvet maternity gown. As more women entered the professions, retailers updated their ranges. Harman remembers being overjoyed when Marks \u0026amp Spencer introduced women’s trouser suits – it felt like you were going to work rather than to a “picnic in the countryside”, and helped a new generation of feminist MPs be taken seriously. The 1990s saw a new wave of female Labour MPs, helped by all-women shortlists. Condescendingly called “Blair’s Babes”, many of these Labour women were given fashion advice by Labour MP Barbara Follett, who “did their colours”. Subsequent photos of New Labour women were a rainbow sea of shoulder-padded suit jackets.Today, women are much more visible in the Commons, with 208 female MPs out of 650. But, perhaps predictably, the same judgments are levelled at their wardrobes, as highlighted by the controversy over Theresa May’s leather trousers and kitten heels. When I interviewed the prime minister for my book, she told me she has had “double-page spreads on ‘am I the new Cara Delevingne’, and ‘how not to dress over 50’” in the same newspaper. In 2005 Jo Swinson, elected as the youngest MP at 25, was invited to pose in school uniform by a newspaper and in a bikini for a lads’ mag.Wilkinson said in 1928 that women had “starved in prison, they have given their lives, in order that women might sit in this House and take part in the legislation of the country”. But the battle to have women’s voices heard was not over when they arrived in Westminster. When Astor was attempting to take her seat in the Commons, male colleagues tried to physically block her path. In the 1960s Shirley Williams remembers being routinely pinched on the bottom by male MPs. She initiated a campaign of stiletto-wearing to stamp on the feet of offenders. The potential for abuse is today exacerbated by social media.The fight for equality is a battle to be seen and heard. But the price of political power has been the scrutiny, and sometimes vilification, of women’s bodies and wardrobes. In part this is intended to silence or belittle us. It has not, and will not, work – as evidenced by the determination of female MPs to challenge expectations and take the centre stage of politics.I hope that the next hundred years will see an end to abuse and objectification, and that women – and men – will be judged for what they say and do.Rachel Reeves is Labour MP for Leeds West.

The group is likely to stick with its current name.It is understood that the group has received donations amounting to several hundreds of thousands of pounds from many hundreds of small donors, and is now actively seeking larger-scale financial backing that will allow it to fund central and regional offices and electoral campaigns.Members of the group are planning a series of regional meetings around the country in the next few weeks at which they hope to attract disaffected supporters of the existing main parties.Sources said that talks were under way with several other Labour MPs –and more Tories – who are unhappy and also considering defecting.The difficulties the group will face in maintaining momentum and building a profile were underlined last week when an amendment it put down calling for another Brexit referendum was not called by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow.The former Labour MP Luciana Berger, who quit Labour over its handling of antisemitism, was also not selected at prime minister’s questions by Bercow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f20ad68251a66232d7912cc7d7279a0641a1b25/0_104_4049_2429/master/4049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=987208fb29556bfcb43493504b2cf61e","title":"spacex crew dragon spacecraft successfully launches","story":"Launch brings US plans to resume sending people into space in own spacecraft closerAstronauts could be flying again from US soil as early as this summer after the flawless launch of SpaceX’s privately built Crew Dragon capsule opened “a new era in American excellence”, according to the head of the space agency Nasa.The unmanned spacecraft lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the early hours of Saturday, atop a Falcon 9 rocket. It is scheduled to dock with the international space station on Sunday, for a five-day visit that will test the systems and operations required to allow humans to be aboard the first manned mission pencilled in for July.The milestone test flight, packed with supplies for the space station and crewed by a sensor-clad dummy named Ripley – after Sigourney Weaver’s character in the Alien movies – edges the US closer to ending an eight-year drought in launching humans into space caused by the retirement of Nasa’s space shuttle fleet in July 2011.Since then the agency has had to pay its former space race adversary Russia about $81m per seat to ferry American astronauts to the space station aboard ageing Soyuz rockets.“Today’s successful launch marks a new chapter in American excellence, getting us closer to once again flying American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,” Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, said in a tweet posted minutes after the spectacular 2.49am launch he also called “a major milestone in our nation’s history”.Bridenstine expanded on his thoughts at a post-launch press conference in which he paid tribute to international agreements that kept the US in space for almost a decade and looked ahead to a new era of government-private partnership.“We want to make sure we keep our partnership with Russia, which has been very strong for a long time going back to the Apollo-Soyuz era, but we also want to make sure we have our own capability to get back and forth to the international space station,” he said.“But I think another big milestone here is the idea that we’re not, as an agency, as Nasa, we’re not purchasing, owning and operating our own rockets at this point. We’re looking to a future where we can be a customer, one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace in lower Earth orbit.”SpaceX, a California-based company founded by the billionaire Elon Musk, the co-founder of PayPal, has already proven to be a successful commercial partner, carrying supplies and equipment to the space station orbiting 250 miles above Earth dozens of times on its fleet of reusable Falcon 9 booster rockets and Dragon cargo capsules.With its main rival Boeing, SpaceX is also one of the two lead partners in Nasa’s commercial crew programme, set up to hand over the development and construction of next-generation, near-Earth spacecraft and launch systems while the government agency concentrates on deeper space ambitions such as the moon and Mars.SpaceX has a contract worth $2.6bn while the next step in Boeing’s $4.2bn programme is scheduled to be an unmanned test flight of its CST-100 Starliner in April.Musk, a technology pioneer who also founded the electric car maker Tesla, said the launch had left him drained.“To be frank, I’m a little emotionally exhausted,” he said. “That was super stressful, but it worked, so far. We have to dock with the station, we have to come back, but so far it has worked. We have passed some of the riskiest items.”He also paid tribute to his 6,000 employees at SpaceX.“It’s been 17 years to get to this point, from 2002 until now, an incredible amount of hard work and sacrifice from a lot of people to have gotten to this point. I’d also like to express great appreciation for Nasa. SpaceX wouldn’t be here without Nasa, without the incredible work that was done before SpaceX even started and without the support after SpaceX did start.”The two Nasa astronauts who will crew the first manned mission, former military pilots Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken, watched the launch from the SpaceX control room three miles from the launchpad.“I can’t begin to explain how exciting it is for a test pilot to be on a first flight of a mission,” Hurley said, looking forward to the planned summer mission."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94078443f409cdefe176b7e804fc64d0eaab52ef/0_17_5209_3125/master/5209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=651e2ac556c5518767ccb33d623bb78d","title":"raise legal smoking age to 21 say mps","story":"Smokers will be banned from buying cigarettes until they are 21 as part of measures to improve public health being considered by the government.An influential cross-party group of MPs has proposed raising the minimum smoking age and introducing a levy on big tobacco companies to fund measures to encourage people to quit and to prevent youngsters taking up the habit.The parliamentary group on smoking and health, backed by 17 health charities and medical organisations, also wants to tighten the rules on showing smoking on TV and in films.“Smoking remains the leading cause of premature death and health inequalities,” said Tory MP Bob Blackman, chair of the group. “Ratcheting up tobacco regulation further and faster is essential to achieve the government’s vision for prevention, to increase healthy life expectancy while reducing inequalities between the richest and poorest in society.”The group, which was instrumental in introducing plain packaging and banning smoking in public places, believes it is pushing at an open door.Hancock has said the government is prepared to introduce new legislation to curb smoking rates. “Smoking remains one of the biggest causes of years of life lost in Britain and other countries,” said David Halpern, who heads the government’s behavioural insight team or “nudge” unit. “The good news is that we have learned a great deal about how to help smokers quit. Pushing forward on this agenda is one of our single best bets to extend life expectancy in the UK, particularly among disadvantaged communities.”The group’s submission to the government’s green paper is backed by Action on Smoking and Health, and 16 other health and welfare organisations, including the British Medical Association, Cancer Research UK, the Royal College of Physicians and the British Heart Foundation. It also calls for the collection and publication of tobacco manufacturers’ sales and marketing data, to monitor the evolving behaviour of the industry, and inserts for cigarette packs with messages encouraging people to quit. There would also be increased funding for education campaigns on social and mass media.Baroness Finlay, a vice-chair of the group, said action was needed because “smoking rates among young people have now started to flatline and the inequalities gap is widening”.Raising the age limit at which people can buy cigarettes to 21 would put the UK on a par with only a few countries and cities in the world, including Honduras, Kuwait and New York City. But it is the introduction of a levy, now said to be under serious consideration by ministers, that could prove the most alarming to the tobacco industry.Under the new proposal, each tobacco manufacturer would effectively have to pay an annual fee based on the volume of smoked cigarettes it sold in the UK, potentially raising hundreds of millions of pounds. But the tobacco industry has fought hard to resist successive governments from introducing legislation that would reduce its profits.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said: “Legislation to strictly regulate smoking used to be considered controversial and extreme by all mainstream political parties but governments now have confidence that tough tobacco regulation both delivers results, and, crucially, has widespread cross-party and public support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09ddf4efb953f9522d5a9ae364f9192b02a113d5/0_86_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa35284cfde2c53bf195acf5aec9530","title":"exeter sean lonsdale sale joe ford leicester waps premiership roundup","story":"Exeter remain top of the Gallagher Premiership as the Chiefs provided a hammer-blow to Sale Sharks’ top-four ambitions following a 20-14 triumph at the AJ Bell Stadium.Rob Baxter’s side took advantage of mistakes by the Sharks to run in two first-half tries through Ollie Devoto and Don Armand.

I couldn’t think of a single reason why a person would use that group to promote … anything!” Dexter said she hadn’t read her boss’s screed before it was published and made sure he knew how strongly she disagreed.Images of the startling headline triggered a media firestorm, and one Sutton added fuel to in subsequent interviews. “If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out DC, we’d all been better off,” he told the Montgomery Advertiser.Asked to elaborate, he alluded to lynchings, saying: “We’ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them.”As the widespread condemnation seemed destined to sink the paper, which had a small circulation of a few thousand and no online presence, Dexter said she planned to finish up the last of her tasks – she had been working in an administrative role – and would offer to leave. Instead, Sutton approached her to take over the paper that had been run by himself and before that, his father, for more than 50 years.“I wasn’t prepared at all. He’s looking at me, saying: ‘I want you to take over everything’ – be the publisher, editor, all of it.”She accepted. On Wednesday she published her first edition with her own editorial titled: “I am Alabama too!”Dexter told the  she found the editorial hard to square with what she knew of Sutton, her boss of a few months, who she said had been nothing but warm and complimentary to her in her brief time as an employee.“I wasn’t working in a hostile environment, I wasn’t working in a demeaning environment,” she told the . “I’m careful because I don’t want people to feel like I’m sticking up for him. I’m just saying, I can’t make him into something that he wasn’t.”It wasn’t always this way. Sutton and his tiny newspaper drew national attention two decades ago for their reporting on corruption by a local sheriff, receiving a congressional citation and being discussed as a potential Pulitzer prize contender.Dexter said discovered from talking to people in the community, that the turn may have been reflective of Sutton’s declining health.Sutton has had three strokes in recent years and, according to Dexter, routinely tells her that his “mind ain’t what it used to be”. “The paper started off as a very community focused-on paper,” said Dexter. “They had pictures up when people got married, pictures of things going on in the town. Then a lot of people stopped putting those stories of stuff like that in the paper because of the things that were being said.”Dexter, who has no news background but family roots in the town and region, said she hopes to revive the paper by getting back to those community-oriented roots. Sutton will remain the owner and, technically, Dexter’s boss, but has ceded editorial control to her.

We once again urge the US side to immediately withdraw the arrest warrant and extradition request for Ms Meng Wanzhou and urge the Canadian side to immediately release Ms Meng Wanzhou and ensure that she returns to China safe and sound.”Legal experts had predicted the government of prime minister Justin Trudeau would give the go-ahead for extradition proceedings, given the close judicial relationship between Canada and the United States.It could be years, though, before Meng is sent to the United States, since Canada’s slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.A final decision will probably come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.Professor Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs said “the Canadians will take a beating throughout this whole process” from China.“I suspect the Trudeau government is desperately hoping that the Americans reach a deal with the Chinese,” he said by phone.Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China, prompting Ottawa to stress the extradition process should not be politicized. Last week, Trump played down the idea of dropping the charges.After Meng’s detention, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds, and a Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian man who previously had only been jailed for drug smuggling.Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who had served two postings in China, said Beijing was likely to retaliate further.“They’re not going to take this lying down ... one shudders to think what the consequences could be,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, saying Beijing might crack down on Canadian canola shipments or stop Chinese students from going to Canada.Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.Beijing had earlier questioned the state of judicial independence in Canada, noting the government faced accusations it had tried to intervene to stop a corruption trial.The Canadian justice minister, David Lametti, declined to comment. Huawei was not immediately available for comment.Meng’s lawyers said they were disappointed and described the US charges as politically motivated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7760493bfd997ab31ffd1e5f53c1ddcf6aae04a8/0_140_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc321420bf7261dc15b9da0b0d2cef7a","title":"tell us how are you marking international womens day 2019","story":"We’ll be telling stories you contribute on 8 March – wherever you are in the world get in touch belowOn Friday 8 March millions of people will be taking part in events to mark International Women’s Day.

Symptoms include bouts of extreme condescension, an inability to stop sputtering the word “socialist”, and overwhelming anger that a young woman of colour is unapologetically succeeding.On Tuesday Turner ranted in the Wall Street Journal that Ocasio-Cortez “has little regard for the system that made it possible for her to be elected to Congress”. Turner also lamented that the congresswoman “leads a generation of young people to take pride in their ignorance – of the laws of nature, of history, of the Constitution, of the eternal battle for freedom – and still succeed”.As you can imagine, the congresswoman had a few words to say in response to this, tweeting on Thursday that: “I guess WSJ Editorial Page takes pride in their ignorance of our nation’s history of slavery, Jim Crow, \u0026amp mass incarceration willful doubt on the decades of science on climate change targeting of indigenous peoples, and the classist, punitive agenda targeting working families.”Ocasio-Cortez hit the bigoted nail on the head with that. After all, what Turner was essentially saying in her op-ed was that minorities should respect a system that doesn’t respect them. That Ocasio-Cortez, who “doesn’t come from a rich and powerful family”, doesn’t have an Ivy League education, and has Puerto Rican heritage, should be grateful she is allowed to exist in America, let alone succeed. And that AOC certainly shouldn’t mess with the laws of nature and history that mean rich white men, and a few rich white women, are our leaders and superiors. Turner, and conservatives like her, are terrified by Ocasio-Cortez because she symbolizes a new generation who aren’t going to shut up and be grateful, but are intent on changing an unequal system.“Crazy” and “hysterical” are gendered insults that have been used to belittle women for centuries. A new Nike ad featuring Serena Williams takes on the C-word, with Williams saying: “If we show emotion, we’re called dramatic … if we dream of equal opportunity, we’re delusional … And if we get angry, we’re hysterical, irrational, or just being crazy.” It’s a powerful ad and Williams, who has been relentlessly vilified as an Angry Black Woman, is the perfect person to narrate it. However, before we start applauding Nike, it’s worth remembering that the company is currently in the middle of a class-action lawsuit accusing it of gender discrimination. So while it’s great that big companies are taking on important issues in their advertising, let’s not forget that it is much easier to make feelgood ads than it is actually walk the walk and implement equality in your workplace.Dozens of female leaders have signed an open letter warning that populist movements around the world threaten gender equality. Susana Malcorra, the former Argentinian foreign minister, told the  that women’s rights are particularly threatened in countries that have seen the rise of “a macho-type strongman”, such as Brazil, the Philippines and Italy.According to a new report by the World Bank the only countries in the world where men and women have equal legal work rights are Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden.Decathlon, a French sports retailer, has cancelled its plans to sell a runner’s hijab after backlash. The budget minister, Gérald Darmanin, was one of the many politicians who spoke out about the hijab: “I value women’s freedom more than commercial freedom,” he told French radio station Europe 1. Look, everyone’s entitled to their opinion on the hijab. But speaking out against a product that would lead to more Muslim women going out running because you “value women’s freedom” is disingenuous to say the least. Just say you’re Islamophobic and get it over with, mate.Tabitha King is an author and an autonomous human being – but is usually referred to in the media as “Stephen King’s wife”. King recently spoke out about being treated as an appendage in a series of messages shared on her husband’s Twitter account. “Wife is a relationship or status. It is not an identity,” she wrote. “You might consider the unconscious condescension in your style book, and give women their names.”Speaking of giving women their names, Happy Women’s History Month. Why not kick it off by reading about Shirley Chisholm, the first black congresswoman. Her campaign slogan was “unbought and unbossed” and one imagines Grace-Marie Turner would not have liked her at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f24ebb48f2cfb3bb39d6a64bf4776fe550ab2cbe/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83111027bc909754b026d79f66c63dcd","title":"benny gantz can israeli general take down benjamin netanyahu","story":"A few short months ago, it appeared to be a done deal. Benjamin Netanyahu was on track to take a fifth term in office at the Israeli general election . A win at the polls would virtually guarantee him the title of Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, snatching it from the country’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion.But then an army general stepped in. “No Israeli leader is king,” Benny Gantz promised as he kicked off his campaign less than three months before Israelis go to the polls. “I thank prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his 10 years of service. We will continue from here.” Gantz, 59, running a centrist party called Blue and White after the Israeli flag, has since climbed rapidly in the polls to become the first serious contender to unseat Netanyahu, 69. The former army chief has no political experience and few concrete policies, but hopes to appeal to voters on one basis more than any other: that he is not Netanyahu.Last week, as Israel’s attorney general said he intended to indict Netanyahu in three separate corruption cases, that decision appeared prescient. The prime minister, who denies wrongdoing, claimed that the legal case against him was a political ploy “just to topple the right wing and raise the left to the premiership”.Gantz replied just half an hour later: “Israel deserves better.”Tall, blue-eyed and silver-haired, Gantz has the look of a political star, but his lack of political heft and fondness for opaque promises has provided fodder for critics. But if Israel’s history shows a theme in politics, it is that voters hanker for a leader with military credentials. Gantz is the 12th chief of staff to enter politics. Two of his predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak, became prime minister.Gantz has sought to appeal to both sides of a country where political isions run deep. His message is one that many are eager to believe: “There is no more right and left, there is only Israel before everything,” goes his party’s jingle. But many of his policies remain a mystery, to the extent that the Haaretz newspaper called his older sister to inquire what they were. Even she, it found, “didn’t know his political views”. Gantz’s team have denied requests for an interview.To appease as many people as he can, Gantz has had to appear simultaneously rightwing and leftwing. On security issues, he has pushed the message of being both a dove and a hawk. Head of the army from 2011 to 2015, his campaign released a short clip showing a bomb-flattened neighbourhood in Gaza after the 2014 war he led. “Only the strong wins,” reads text on the video, which boasted that Israel killed more than 1,364 “terrorists”. (The claim contradicts a United Nations inquiry that found more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians.) Yet Gantz said in another video that there is “no shame in yearning for peace” and has promised to strive towards a deal with the Palestinians.The mixed messaging has worked, according to analysis by Alon Yakter, a lecturer at the school of political science at Tel Aviv University, and Mark Tessler at the University of Michigan. Gantz’s “success is because of, not despite, his vagueness,” they wrote in the Washington Post. He appeals to what they call a large number of “sceptical doves” – voters who support a peace deal in theory, but doubt it is possible.Ultimately, Gantz is betting on Netanyahu fatigue. For years many Israelis have been dissatisfied with the leadership of the man they know as Bibi, but have not backed a candidate to replace him. Gantz has focused on how Netanyahu has sowed ision and battered state institutions such as the police and judiciary to stay at the top of government.But the veteran also faces battles to uphold his virtuous image. Gantz is being sued by a family in Gaza in a Dutch court for war crimes and was accused last week of sexual misconduct as a senior in high school. It is unclear how those allegations, which he denies, will sway voters. On the campaign trial, Gantz has made sure attention is focused on Netanyahu and his vices. “Your time is up,” he said. “We are moving onwards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baafbd77f2baaf9c8aac95c2056f582b3ab29f9/0_205_4393_2635/master/4393.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3df8f7904c3535380051b6d73724f33","title":"censured by britain hezbollah bigger than ever in beirut","story":"The group has been added to the UK’s terrorist list, but after Assad’s victory in Syria it plays a powerful role in the regionAt the back of a room full of marble-covered graves, a woman nods gently as she reads to her dead son. Another mother puts a candle inside a small lantern on top of a tomb. Both wear black chadors, and neither says anything above a whisper. Here the secrets of dead are laid bare in inscriptions where and when the men were killed, and whom they were fighting for: the most formidable group in Lebanon, Hezbollah.Between the women, an arched wreath covers three graves to which a trickle of visitors is drawn.Life-size photos of three men stand behind them, with a picture of the only woman buried there, the mother of perhaps the militant group’s most revered figure, its former military chief, Imad Mughniyeh. At times during the last two turbulent decades, the Martyrs’ Cemetery on the edge of Beirut’s southern suburbs has heaved with anger as the dead have arrived from battlefields. But last week an air of calm hung over the graveyard, just as it has for many months in Hezbollah’s surrounding heartland, where after seven polarising years of war in Syria, many residents sense the dawn of a new – but no less foreboding – era.Last week, amid a push by the Trump administrationUS to isolate Iran, Britain announced it was listing Hezbollah’s political wing as a terrorist organisation, in a move criticised by Tehran on Saturdayas “deliberately ignoring a large part of the Lebanese people and the legitimacy and the legal position of Hezbollah in Lebanon’s administrative and political structure”.That position has long been obvious – not only here on Beirut’s heavily Shia southern edge, but beyond Lebanon’s borders in Syria. In addition to the 60 or so graves inside the hall, at least another 1,600 have been dug in Lebanon’s Shia villages for Hezbollah members killed in Syria. Nearly all have been buried without fanfare, the losses absorbed by communities accepting the cost of the war, without fully embracing it.Saved from defeat, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad owes his survival to Russia, and to Iran, the linchpin of Hezbollah in Lebanon. The militant group-cum-power broker has eclipsed Lebanon’s other political players and consolidated its role as the country’s most powerful organisation. Hezbollah’s role in Syria has straddled borders and after safeguarding Assad, Hezbollah has begun to reap a prize far higher than the blood and treasure it has committed. In postwar Syria, Hezbollah and Iran are ascendant both playing lead roles in shaping what emerges from the ruins of war. In Beirut, where it controls three ministries and, together with allies, 70 of the 128 parliamentary seats, it has a decisive hand in the fragile new government’s most important decisions.Few Hezbollah members are willing to discuss their role, or that of the group, inside Syria, and those who are choose their words carefully. But outside the cemetery on Friday, one serving member was ready to talk. A veteran of the Hezbollah-led fight to recapture Aleppo from anti-Assad opposition that had seized the eastern half of the city more than five years ago, the man, in his early 20s, insisted on the nom de guerre Abu Hussein.He first paid his respects to one of the mothers inside, he sat down for a discussion. He reiterated an unflinching belief in the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, while also revealing a fear that Hezbollah’s political role had caused it to do things that did not sit comfortably with him.“We fought in Aleppo and I can tell you we behaved with honour, while the Syrian military did not,” he said, sipping bitter coffee on the edge of a noisy street. “When we were advancing, there was a building full of civilians. We knew they were there and we would not attack it, even though it was in their way. The Syrian military came along later and their senior officer, did not care at all who was inside. He just leveled it. We saw many things like that.”Abu Hussein comes from a Hezbollah family, with a surname that wins him patronage across Lebanon. His uncles and brothers are members and some hold leadership positions. He, however, describes himself as “open minded”.Many Hezbollah members are mindful that those they fought in Syria were almost exclusively Sunnis, a fact which has amplified tensions between Islam’s two main sects in Syria and Lebanon. Tensions remain high elsewhere in the region too, 16 years after the US-led invasion of Iraq which pitched the sects against each other in what was primarily a political tussle that has since been underpinned by identity. “We were not fighting Sunnis,” said Abu Hussein. “We were fighting Isis. They were killing Sunnis, too.”With the war near an end, and Assad still in place, many in Hezbollah remain unwilling to believe the insurgency against Assad began as a homegrown revolt. “I don’t think that. I know there were local people at the start. But there were others at the end. We did what we had to do. Now we need to get along again.”Abu Hussein, and other Hezbollah members, seem more comfortable reverting to familiar territory – the ongoing war with Israel, which has intensified efforts in recent months to stop post-war Syria becoming a stronghold for Iran.More than 1,000 Israeli attacks on mainly Iranian targets inside Syria have gone unanswered by Hezbollah, whose leaders fear the hard won gains of their backers, on Syria’s battlefield, and in Lebanon’s parliament, could easily be lost to any enemy that is eager to take the fight to them.A second Hezbollah member, with access to senior leaders said the Israeli attacks in Syria had caused carnage, and even confusion among a group that sees maintaining deterrence as a priority. “The Iranian targets in the military bases in Damascus and Homs were annihilated,” he said. “I mean the damage was unbelievable. People where shocked, here and there. It’s caused many discussions.”As he finished his coffee, Abu Hussein shrugged when asked about the Israelis. “They’re our enemy and they will be for ever. Do you think them arriving and taking that land was right? Is it Palestinian land, or is it for them?For me, my priorities are Lebanon. I will ask questions, I will keep my mind open. Let’s meet again in the summer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8214ad3bfb12902194215353523508440f70c544/0_8_2745_1646/master/2745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5eea49f12fb83fdcc7dd48a865e36ac1","title":"china population control two child policy","story":"by  Lily Kuo and Xueying Wang in ShenyangFor Xu Meiru, 38, the thought of having a second child is exhausting. Her days typically begin at 5am, don’t end until 11pm, and are filled with shuttling her nine-year-old son to school, helping him with his homework, preparing meals and running an online clothing business.“It’s hard to find time even to sleep for a few minutes in a chair,” she says, sitting in a McDonald’s while her son plays a game on a phone, the detritus of a Happy Meal in front of him.Most tiring is the constant worry over whether she is doing enough to help him get ahead. He goes to music lessons, taekwondo classes and extra English tutoring. She spends the first week of every summer and winter break helping him prepare for the next term. Sometimes her son’s workload is so heavy that Xu does his assignments for him, using her left hand to make her writing more childlike.“There are too many children and the competition is too high. If you don’t do well in school you can’t get into a good university, and then maybe you can’t get a good job in the future,” she says. She is visibly anxious when discussing the prospect of a second child, something that until three years ago would have been forbidden under Chinese law. “If we were to have another child, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have the energy for them,” Xu says.Faced with a population that is shrinking and ageing, Chinese policymakers are attempting to engineer a baby boom after more than three decades of a Malthusian family planning regime better-known as the one-child policy. Central policy planners have loosened restrictions on family sizes, and now all married couples can have two children. There is talk of the limits being dropped altogether, and amid aggressive propaganda drives, local officials are experimenting with subsidies and incentives for parents.But these efforts appear to be too little too late. Birthrates have fallen and are likely to continue to drop as parents like Xu decide against having more children. More young women are pushing back against state propaganda and family pressure, while improving education standards and income levels have delayed marriage and childbirth. Moreover, decades of the one-child policy have made single-child households the norm, experts say.“China should have stopped the policy 28 years ago. Now it’s too late,” says Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and a longtime critic of the family planning policies.Demographers warn that China’s population will begin to shrink in the next decade, potentially derailing the world’s second-largest economy, with a far-reaching global impact. China’s birthrate last year was at its lowest since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, with 15.23 million births, dramatically lower than the 21-to-23 million officials had expected.By 2050 as much as a third of the country’s population will be made up of people over the age of 60, putting severe strain on state services and the children who bear the brunt of caring for elderly relatives.Nowhere is this trend more obvious than in China’s rust belt, the north-eastern region better-known as Dongbei which as the lowest birthrates in the country, the result of strict enforcement of family planning limits and the region’s early development. For residents in Shenyang, the largest city in Dongbei, in central Liaoning province, it’s obvious why few families are willing to have more children – the economy.Rich in resources such as iron ore and coal, Dongbei was at the heart of the country’s heavy industry between the 1950s and 1970s. During the reform era, industries moved southward to the coastal regions, and the state-run companies that employed most Dongbei workers have struggled, causing a mass exodus to other parts of China.“Shanghai, Guangzhou, all these cities are moving forward, but Shenyang has stayed in place. All the high-rises don’t change anything,” says Zhang Yang, 36, who works in purchasing for a local state-owned company. “Few people are having babies because the economy is so bad.”During Dongbei’s heyday, Shenyang was the region’s economic hub, with blocks of factories lining its main street. Now those buildings have been replaced by high-rise apartments, banks and hotels while the factories have been relocated to a suburb outside the city. The new economic zone, the new home for these factories, is quiet.Workers in grey jumpsuits walk along the road just before noon. A sign on a taxi calls on Shenyang residents “to fight” for the rejuvenation of their city. Neighbourhoods in the old industrial sector are being torn down to make way for new buildings.The birthrate here is especially low, at 8.79 per 1,000 women, compared with the national average of 12.43 in 2017. The city is ageing quickly – a quarter of residents were above the age of 60 in 2017, and local population experts believe the city will soon overtake Shanghai to have China’s oldest populace.Dongbei’s struggling economy is the main reason Zhang and his wife have decided not to have another child. He has not had a wage increase in three years. When his son goes to kindergarten in a few years, he expects about half of his income will go toward his schooling and extra classes and activities.His hope is that his son will go to university in the south of China and pursue a career and life there. “It’s not that I’m worried about Liaoning’s future. I have no hope for it at all,” Zhang says.Birthrates in Dongbei, home to about 109 million people, have fallen steeply. The average number of children per woman was 0.9 in 2000 and 0.56 in 2015, according to Yi. That means the next generation will be a quarter of the size of the last one.Last summer, Liaoning released a Population Development Plan, vowing to raise the province’s birthrate by “working hard to create good public opinion about having two children”. Officials promised to explore subsidies for families with two children, encourage employers to offer more services for families, and support women returning to work after giving birth.While parents in Shenyang say they have noticed an increase in nursing facilities at shopping centres and other public spaces, they have yet to see any substantial support from the government. “For all these years, there haven’t been any policies to help. Government pledges like these are like thunder without raindrops. This is like lying to a little child,” Zhang says.Dongbei offers an example of what is to come for the rest of the country. As an early industrial hub, the province urbanised quickly, with incomes and education levels several years ahead of the national average – factors that act as natural constraints on the birthrate, according to experts. As other parts of the country go through similar stages of urbanisation and economic growth, they are going through comparable declines.“This is not just Dongbei but the whole country. You know what they say in economics: development is the best birth control,” says Song Limin of the Population Research Institute at Liaoning University.Researchers believe the national rate of births could fall further. Last year’s low rate surprised many. Liang Jianzhang, a professor of economics at Peking University, says he and his colleagues had expected births to peak in 2017 and begin falling after 2018.“That peak apparently arrived in 2016, with births dropping ever since … What we can expect now is that the number of newborns will continue to shrink rapidly in 2019 and beyond,” he wrote in an editorial in January.“It can be said with certainty that even though 2018 saw a low number of births, that number will not be surpassed for the next 100 years. China will never see more than 15 million newborns in the future,” he predicted.Local governments across China are struggling to reverse the declines with subsidies, propaganda initiatives and new regulations on wokplace leave. In Xiantao, Hubei province, hospitals have offered to cover the costs of childbirth as well as give a 500 yuan (£60) subsidy for the first child and another 700 for the second. In Changsha, in southern China, an advertising campaign last year listed “1,001 reasons to have a baby”. Between 2016 and 2017, almost all provinces extended maternity leave.Some worry that such measures will turn coercive, with the authorities deploying an extensive family planning apparatus to encourage births. Officials once restricted population size through heavy fines, forced abortions and sterilisations.“There is a danger that the government sees that what it has tried so far has failed, and it has to become more coercive. There’s a long history in population planning of extreme coercion. There is no question that the government could adopt coercive measures,” says Leta Hong Fincher, author of Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China.Critics say that less invasive but still punitive measures would probably emerge gradually at local level under the guise of other causes such as preventing sex-selective abortions. Several provinces have banned abortions after 14 weeks, and Jiangxi province in the south requires the signature of three medical professionals before the procedure can be performed. More provinces have put in place obstacles to getting orces, including a test or mandated cooling-off period.Government language has alarmed people. Last year an article in the state-run People’s Daily said: “The birth of a baby is not only a matter of the family itself but also a state affair.” In August, an economics professor from Nanjing University wrote an editorial proposing a “birth fund” that citizens contribute to, then cash in when they have children. Those who don’t have children would get the money when they retire.One internet user wrote: “When you don’t want children, you force people to get sterilised. When you want more, you urge us to give birth. What do you think I am?”For now efforts have focused on cajoling women into have more children for the good of the country. The All China Women’s Federation, a government-affiliated organisation, has been running a “beautiful families” campaign, praising women who serve as primary caretakers of their parents and children.“The party state sees the declining population as a real problem, and it’s women’s duty to respond to that,” says Jane Golley, an associate professor at Australian National University, who focuses on the Chinese economy and labour economics. “It’s a new era of control over women’s reproductive choices.”Yet more women are resisting government and societal pressure, and officials are waking up to their concerns. China’s education and human resources ministries have ordered employers to stop asking female applicants about their marital status and plans for children, a common practice.Ye Liu, a sociologist and lecturer in international development at King’s College London, has been interviewing Chinese women in their late 30s. When the two-child policy was introduced in 2016, most of her respondents were in what should have been the “second spring” of their careers, with the raising of their first child already behind them, with seniority and more bargaining power at work. Many were devastated rather than overjoyed by the new policy.Public resentment is one reason why policymakers did not stop the policy sooner. According to Yi Fuxian, the Wisconsin academic, China could have completely scrapped population controls in 1980 and growth would have moderated naturally. But family planners relied on overinflated school enrolment and overreported births by hospitals, iniduals and local governments. “Why did we follow such a wrong policy for so long? The Chinese government doesn’t want to admit it’s wrong. It says the policy was right but now is the time to change. If it just says the policy was wrong, the public will become angry,” he says.Living in a city with some of the lowest birthrates, Shenyang residents appear surprisingly focused on children. Groups of parents and grandparents tote small children around shopping centres filled with playgrounds and stores advertising toys and educational games. Parents describe the range of activities they can choose from: sensory classes for babies, baby swimming classes, taekwondo, Chinese calligraphy, English tutoring or drawing.The Dunnan True Love Centre in central Shenyang offers high-end convalescence for mothers recuperating after childbirth, a Chinese tradition known as “sitting the month”.This is part of a focus on “quality over quantity”, where families invest all their resources into one child, says Wang Libo, an expert on population at Shenyang Normal University. Of the 500 clients the centre received last year, only three have had a second child, as far as they know. But they expect business to be brisk this year: the year of the pig in the Chinese calendar is associated with luck and wealth and thus an auspicious year to be born.For many families, the pressure to help their child compete is the main reason for having just the one. Xu sends her son to extra tutoring and lessons but worries that he is under too much pressure. She has read articles about children, pushed too hard by their parents, who have killed themselves or run away from home. She tries to find a place in his schedule for some free time, and buys him all the comics and books that he wants. Still, when he performs a little worse on a test or assignment, she grows anxious again. “You can’t help but wonder: what if I pushed him to study for just 10 more minutes?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baafbd77f2baaf9c8aac95c2056f582b3ab29f9/0_219_4393_2636/master/4393.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19c2309d43664313a0bf864c757ce443","title":"iran rebukes uk for outlawing hezbollahs political wing","story":"Britain’s decision to proscribe all wings of Lebanese group draws criticism from TehranIran has criticised Britain for its decision to list Hezbollah’s political wing as a terrorist organisation, saying on Saturday that it ignored both the will of a large portion of the Lebanese people and the group’s role in fighting Islamic State.Britain said on Monday it planned to ban all wings of Hezbollah, which Washington deems a terrorist organisation because of its influence in the Middle East. London previously only proscribed its external security unit and its military wing.“This British measure signifies deliberately ignoring a large part of the Lebanese people and the legitimacy and the legal position of Hezbollah in Lebanon’s administrative and political structure,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Qasemi, was quoted as saying by state news agency Irna.Long the most powerful group in Lebanon and backed by Tehran, Hezbollah’s influence has expanded at home and in the region. It controls three of 30 ministries in the government led by Saad Hariri, Lebanon’s western-backed prime minister.“In addition to ... helping preserve Lebanon’s territorial integrity over recent decades, Hezbollah has been one of the pillars of the fight against terrorism and terrorist groups such as Islamic State in the region,” Qasemi said.Iran and Hezbollah are major players in the war in Syria and the fight against militant groups opposed to the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad, which include Islamic State."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0effeae4a8803f5df052fd8934f787ccfd3248d4/0_459_4923_2953/master/4923.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f891d35ae319652f59152a7989b08cde","title":"saudi arabia detained womens rights activists to be put on trial","story":"More than dozen arrested in 2018 and rights groups say some have been torturedSaudi women’s rights activists detained last year in a sweeping crackdown on campaigners will be put on trial, prosecutors have said.“The public prosecution would like to announce that it has concluded its investigation and prepared the indictment list against the defendants ... and will refer the case to the relevant court,” the state-controlled Saudi Press Agency said on Friday.The brief statement did not directly identify the defendants as female activists nor give a date for court proceedings.More than a dozen activists were arrested in May last year – just before the historic lifting of a decades-long ban on female drivers the following month. Many of them were accused of undermining security and aiding enemies of the state. Some were subsequently released.Those still detained include Aziza al-Yousef, a retired professor at Riyadh’s King Saud University, and Loujain al-Hathloul – who was held in 2014 for more than 70 days for attempting to drive from neighbouring United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia.Some of those detained have faced sexual harassment and torture during interrogation, rights groups and their family members say. Several people with knowledge of their arrest have told the Associated Press that some of the women detained have been subjected to caning, electrocution and others were also sexually assaulted. In February a cross-party panel of three British MPs found the female activists were being detained in cruel and inhumane conditions that meet the threshold of torture under both international and Saudi law.Friday’s statement from prosecutors said “all detainees in this case enjoy all rights preserved by the laws in the kingdom”.But the statement drew sharp criticism from human rights groups.“These women’s rights activists should be released from detention for their peaceful activism not referred to trial,” Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East campaigns director, said. “The Saudi Arabian authorities continue their signature repression.”Michael Page, the deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said: “The Saudi prosecution is bringing charges against the women’s rights activists instead of releasing them unconditionally. “The Saudi authorities have done nothing to investigate serious allegations of torture, and now, it’s the women’s rights activists, not any torturers, who face criminal charges and trials.”Agence France-Press and Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Singular talent the driving force behind numerous landmark buildings worldwideCathy Ward (41) found dead in Clondalkin house on FridayTaoiseach pledges to unblock remedial legislation in Seanad \u0026lsquoin next couple of weeks\u0026rsquoMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues two weather warnings for wind and rainAlliance leader Naomi Long says there is no will to restore the AssemblyLocals mount third demonstration in as many weeks over contentious Crosbie planCouncillor calls for problem to be addressed in areas such as Temple Bar before summerWin comes days after syndicate collects almost \u0026euro175mDaily  says former British servicemen could soon face murder chargesGarda\u0026iacute from several units made seizure of cannabis herb and cocaineLaunch will provide vital data on whether the spacecraft is ready to carry passengersGovernment\u0026rsquos draft proposals rejected by nurses\u0026rsquo organisationTaoiseach says law to be changed to restore UK-Ireland fishing rightsPeople Before Profit and Sinn F\u0026eacutein are resisting any increase in carbon taxMorgan D\u0027Arcy has been an inpatient at Crumlin children\u0027s hospital for five yearsBallymun Kickhams\u0026rsquo designated site may by needed as depot for rail projectBusinessman loses defamation case against Sunday Business PostSchoolchildren to protest lack of action by adults on climate issues in one-day strikeDeath of David Lynch outside his home in Clondalkin is being investigated as a drug-related murder"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3811440.1551464737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit veil of silence as british attorney general cox joins talks","story":"As talks between the EU Brexit task force and the UK resumed last week – notably involving visits to Brussels by British attorney general Geoffrey Cox to meet negotiators – a veil of silence again descended on the substance of those discussions.We’ve re-entered “the tunnel”, in the words of Sabine Weyand, the deputy head of the task force.Cox is crucial. His highly influential legal opinion to the Commons in December argued that the UK could become trapped in the backstop for good. “In the absence of a right of termination,” he wrote, “there is a legal risk that the United Kingdom might become subject to protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations ...“In international law, the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding arrangement took its place.”The backstop is the legal guarantee in the protocol to the withdrawal agreement that, should the EU and UK be unable to agree in time a future trading relationship that safeguards the frictionless border in Ireland, the UK will sustain agreed measures to protect it.The focus of the current talks is reportedly a search for a means by which the attorney general could revise his damning opinion and sway key votes on March 12th in support of the withdrawal agreement – crucially without amending the agreement, which the EU insists cannot be reopened.Yet there are provisions in the agreement – specifically a clause on arbitration of disputes – that do directly address those Cox concerns and that, it could be argued, refute persuasively the case made repeatedly by opponents of UK prime minister Theresa May that the EU could indefinitely delay the UK’s departure.Unilateral exitSources in Brussels say that the arbitration provisions are indeed a major focus of Cox’s diplomacy in the search for a “legally binding” assurance. A letter from the EU to London highlighting its provisions, it is argued, may help to do the trick.Sources also suggest that the attorney general is contemplating telling the House of Commons that the explicitly “temporary” nature of the backstop in the agreement would allow the UK to argue that in international law it would be entitled to repudiate the protocol unilaterally if it became clear that the backstop was in fact becoming a permanent fixture.It is not an interpretation of international law that the EU would share and so there can be no question of the union acknowledging such a right, but Brexiteers would certainly cheer Cox’s affirmation of it to the rafters.While the arbitration provisions do not provide either a specific time limit to the backstop or a mechanism for unilateral withdrawal – the sorts of guarantees being sought by the DUP and other critics of May – they do ensure that a decision to suspend the backstop is not ultimately at the sole discretion of the EU and would be timely.Under the agreement a joint committee, co-chaired by the UK and EU, is charged with the “implementation, application and interpretation” of the agreement once in force after the transition period. The protocol to the agreement (article 20) must be reviewed by the Joint Committee at either party’s request within six months, if either considers that it “is no longer necessary to achieve the objectives set out in article 1(3) and should cease to apply in whole or in part”.Should the joint committee be deadlocked on the proposal to suspend the backstop, the matter can be referred to an arbitration panel of five chaired by an independent figure nominated and agreed by both sides.A further difficultyIf Cox is indeed prepared to revise his negative opinion on the basis of a review and an EU public re-endorsement of the arbitration proposals, he may face some continuing difficulties with a key aspect of the protocol review clause. It clearly requires that any review of the backstop can only be contemplated if it “is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives” – the safeguarding of a frictionless border.That is a test the independent arbitrator cannot ignore, and one that points to permanent UK commitments, which it is unwilling to make at present.Although the UK might be willing to sign up now to the withdrawal agreement on the basis of such an interpretation, and get us through the immediate logjam, the central problems with the backstop’s potential permanence do not go away.

Photograph: Jack TaylorGetty When Labour MPs walked through the ision lobby at Westminster shortly after 7pm on Wednesday, they knew defeat was certain. But for many of the party’s MPs, members and supporters, losing the vote unlocked a prize they have been pursuing for almost three years: Labour’s backing for a second referendum on Brexit.The amendment, which was defeated by 83 votes, outlined Labour’s plan for Brexit, including a permanent customs union and close alignment with the single market. Two days earlier Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s leader, said that, if his first amendment failed, Labour would be “putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.Polls show that about three in five Labour voters favour a second referendum, and support is even higher among the party’s membership. Younger members and those in Momentum, the powerful Corbyn-supporting movement that has emerged as a party within a party, are especially enthusiastic about a vote that could reverse the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.A lifelong Eurosceptic who voted against the United Kingdom’s membership in the 1975 referendum and opposed the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties, Corbyn resisted until this week. In the 2017 general election, Labour promised to respect the previous year’s referendum and to bring together the 52 per cent who voted Leave and the 48 per cent who voted Remain.After Theresa May laid down her red lines ruling out membership of a customs union or the single market, Labour offered a softer Brexit. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, slowly nudged the leadership towards embracing a customs union and, later, a “close relationship” with the single market. But it was an uphill struggle.“Corbyn plus his team of Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy have provided a sort of iron wall of resistance to the pressure applied by Keir Starmer,” says Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London who runs the research initiative UK in a Changing Europe.Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions on the soft left of the party, who has been in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet since 2016, has avoided public criticism of the leader and his allies. Last September, he helped to persuade Labour’s annual conference to adopt a Brexit motion mandating support for a second referendum if the party could not win support for its version of Brexit and failed to trigger a general election.Corbyn’s decision to back a referendum last Monday followed a three-hour meeting with Starmer, who later confirmed that the choice on the ballot paper would be between “a viable Leave option” and remaining in the EU.“One interpretation of this is that Jeremy Corbyn has played Brexit brilliantly,” Menon says. “He sort of supported Remain in the referendum but not enough to prevent Leave from winning – which actually, politically, might have suited him quite well. Because I don’t see Corbyn being as popular as he was in 2017 without the referendum, which challenged the existing order and was a sort of revolutionary moment, and that helped Corbyn.“In 2017 he attracted votes from Leave and Remain because he was profoundly ambiguous. Now he’s in a position where he can say, ‘We’re in favour of a referendum, because we don’t support a Tory Brexit – but, actually, I didn’t block Brexit either.’ So he’s hoping to pull off the same trick. I think the elastic is being stretched fairly thin.”The trigger for Corbyn’s decision was the departure a week earlier of eight Labour MPs to form the Independent Group with three disaffected Conservatives. The MPs who left Labour were unhappy with Corbyn’s leadership for a number of reasons, including his handling of anti-Semitism within the party. But their primary motivation was Labour’s approach to Brexit and its failure to back a second referendum, which they all strongly support.Corbyn feared that other MPs would follow the rebels out of the party – a real danger given the lack of support within the parliamentary party for his leadership and the intensification of feeling over Brexit as the endgame approaches.Most MPs welcomed the party’s embrace of a referendum, but some in constituencies that voted heavily for Brexit in 2016, such as Lisa Nandy, who represents Wigan, near Manchester, reacted angrily.“Large numbers of my constituents are now saying they want to vote for no deal at all. And there’s a real problem here, because not listening to people… is frankly what got us here in the first place,” she said. “We’re about to go back and repeat all those same mistakes again. And worse than that, actually, we’re not being clear with people still. You’ve got members of the shadow cabinet, for example, with deep reservations about this, as surprised as anyone to hear this announcement on Monday.”Even after Wednesday’s vote, a number of shadow cabinet members close to the leadership released videos extolling the merits of Labour’s own plan for Brexit. At the same time, left-wing activists in the Another Europe Is Possible group said it was not enough for Labour to vote for a second referendum: it must also campaign for it.John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University and Britain’s leading expert on electoral behaviour, says it was always going to be in Labour’s interest to move towards Remain.“One understands why the Labour Party has tried to keep as many people as possible for as long as possible, because around 30 per cent of its voters voted to leave and 70 per cent voted to remain. But clearly, given those numbers, when forced to choose, then it makes sense for it to be leaning in a Remain direction,” he says.“The way they’re trying to frame it, and thereby trying to keep Labour Leave voters happy, is to say, ‘We want to use the referendum to vote down Mrs May’s deal.’ Labour’s position decoded is: ‘We think that if Mrs May gets her deal through the House of Commons, then she should have to put it to a referendum.’ They’re not saying that ‘if Mrs May cannot get her deal through the House of Commons we will give her a second chance.’ And that’s a crucial distinction, because they are therefore trying to label it as being against a Tory Brexit.”Two out of three Labour MPs represent constituencies that voted Leave in 2016, but Curtice says the statistic is misleading, because even in Leave-voting seats most Labour voters backed Remain. He also questions the argument made by opponents of a second referendum that most of the seats Labour needs to gain in order to win a general election are in heavily pro-Brexit areas.“I think that calculation excludes Scotland and is therefore completely misleading. Remember that virtually every seat in Scotland is marginal between Labour and the SNP, and Scotland is Remain territory. Jeremy Corbyn’s chances of becoming prime minister rest, crucially, on being able to recover in Scotland, and the SNP are competing with him for the pro-Remain vote, because the SNP are in favour of a second EU referendum,” he says.Labour’s support for a referendum is necessary but not sufficient to make it happen given the current parliamentary arithmetic at Westminster. Up to 25 Labour MPs are likely to defy the whip and oppose it, and there is no evidence that the number of Conservatives supporting it would be enough to tip the balance.Labour is expected to table its amendment when May brings her deal back to the Commons for a “meaningful vote” by March 12th, but the party has not yet decided what form it should take. One option is to adopt a version of an amendment drafted by the Labour backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which offers to support May’s deal on condition that it be put to a confirmatory referendum.“The point about the Kyle-Wilson amendment, which I thought was clever politics, is that the people who have been campaigning for a second referendum have framed it so much as giving people a chance to change their minds, because they were led astray by Boris Johnson et al in 2016, that they’ve turned it into a Remainer cause,” Curtice says.“But the clever thing about the Kyle-Wilson amendment was to say, ‘You know what? We’ll let it through, Mrs May. But then, for it to become law, it has to go to a referendum’.”Campaigners for a second referendum have long believed that their best hope of success will come after all other options have been exhausted. May’s promise to MPs of a vote to extend the article 50 deadline opens up the prospect of the House of Commons seeking a compromise based on a softer Brexit if the prime minister’s deal is rejected a second time.If there is no majority for a softer Brexit, MPs just might opt for a second referendum, but if it were called, how would it turn out?“My current running average is Remain 53, Leave 47, and the polls have consistently shown Remain narrowly ahead for a long time. But much of that lead rests not on people changing their minds but on those who didn’t vote 2½ years ago, who are at least two to one in favour of Remain – at least that’s what they told the pollsters. But will they turn out? Even with them showing up, it’s 53-47, which means the campaign matters. And the Remain side are going to have to figure out an answer to the immigration question,” Curtice says.The prime minister has one further option, which is to call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, this requires a two-thirds majority in the Commons, but Labour would almost certainly vote for it. The Conservatives have recently opened up a strong lead in the polls, and Corbyn is now deeply unpopular and has lost all the gains in his personal popularity he made during the 2017 campaign.Conservative MPs will be reluctant to face another campaign with May as their leader, however, and Curtice believes that unless one of the two main parties implodes, Brexit has made it almost impossible for either to make significant gains.“This country is so polarised between those who are ardent Remainers and those who are gung-ho Leavers, and there’s very little ground in the middle. Which is why Mrs May’s deal is struggling with public opinion as well as in the House of Commons. And it’s why the Labour Party’s idea that it’s going to bring the 52 per cent and the 48 per cent together by triangulation is also probably for the birds. Norway, customs union, single market: these are Remainer solutions, and they won’t bring the country together,” he says.“We have politicians who are used to being perennially told that you’ve got to seek the centre ground in politics. There isn’t a centre ground after Brexit. The distribution of attitudes is U-shaped: it’s the extremes that are well populated, not the middle.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche wrote it for the Richard Gere movie An Officer and A Gentleman. It was sung as a duet after Jennifer Warnes suggested a collaboration with Joe Cocker. Warnes had been a fan of the late Cocker since her teenage years and said she cried out with joy when he accepted the invitation to work with her. Their version was a worldwide hit and also won a Golden Globe and a Grammy.In Swing Time, Fred Astaire sings the gorgeous ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” to Ginger Rogers while she is washing her hair. The sentimental lyrics were written by the brilliant songwriter Dorothy Fields, whose credits include “A Fine Romance” and “The Sunny Side of the Street”. The song, with music composed by Jerome Kern, was up against some terrific competition in 1936 – beating “Pennies from Heaven” and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” to an award in its third year. Billie Holiday, with jazz maestro Teddy Wilson on piano, had a hit with “The Way You Look Tonight” that year and the song has since been recorded by hundreds of best-selling singers, including Frank Sinatra. “The Way You Look Tonight” is popular, romantic songwriting at its very best.Sammy Fain’s formal love ballads epitomised the style of movie music in the 1950s. Fain won the Academy award for best song twice – for “Secret Love”, from the 1953 Doris Day movie Calamity Jane and, two years later, with the title song for Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing. Fain, a trained pianist, started out as song promoter in the 1920s and he was pragmatic about delivering the song studio bosses wanted for this William Holden movie. Fain and lyricist Paul Francis Webster constantly tinkered with the words in “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” to keep 20th Century-Fox happy. The song, performed by The Four Aces on the soundtrack, has remained a favourite of crooners, from Sinatra to Barry Manilow. The song has also been referenced in numerous modern films, including Grease and Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.410 7) “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” (The Lion King 1994)In songwriting terms, it was essentially Elton John v Randy Newman in 1994. Newman was nominated for “Make Up Your Mind” for The Paper and John for three songs from The Lion King (his other nominations were for the songs “The Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata”). “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”, co-written with Tim Rice, was a popular winner and the single sold 11 million copies. Canadian Céline Dion’s power ballad “My Heart Will Go On”, the theme song to James Cameron’s hit film Titanic, has been bought more than 20 million times. “My Heart Will Go On” is the romantic ballad playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embrace at the front of the ill-fated liner that crashed into a iceberg. Dion showed great technical skill coping with the tricky modulations of a song written by James Horner and Will Jennings, while the poignant tin-whistle playing is courtesy of Andrea Corr.Top Gun was virtually completed when Tom Whitlock came up with the lyrics to “Take My Breath Away” as he was driving home from work and mulling on a melody Giorgio Moroder had composed. The agreed they had something good and made a demo to play for director Tony Scott. He called back Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis to shoot some new love scenes to go with the new song. “If you see those scenes, you\u0027ll notice that they are lit differently and there are those gauzy curtains blowing around,” Whitlock told rediscoverthe80s “All of that was to disguise that some months had gone by and the actors didn\u0027t look exactly the same.”710 4) “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (The Woman in Red, 1984)In 1984, another year of popular movie title songs (“Ghostbusters” and “Footloose” were in the running), the Oscar went to Stevie Wonder’s “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. Wonder said that he had the late John Lennon in mind for a song he claimed he had first thought of in 1976. “I had the melody and lyric for the chorus, and I imagined in my mind when hearing the chords that The Beatles were singing with me. And that idea and feeling is what inspired me to use the vocoder.” The song was written for the movie The Woman in Red, a mediocre comedy starring Gene Wilder. In 2018, singer-songwriter John Prine recorded a slow, stripped-down version of the song for Spotify Singles, in which he brings out the essential charm of a ballad some find too saccharine. Wonder’s winner was a particular favourite of the writer Maya Angelou810 3) “Moon River” (Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 1961)In Blake Edwards’s film of the Truman Capote novel Breakfast at Tiffany’s, there is a scene in which the love interest Audrey Hepburn sits on the fire escape at a New York apartment and accompanies herself on guitar singing “Moon River”. The scene is charming and the waif-like Hepburn, staying in tune and doing her best with a singing voice that was thin and limited in range, delivers a moving version of a song written for her by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.The film noir Captain Carey, U.S.A, a tale of revenge set in the aftermath of the Second World War that starred Alan Ladd, is regarded now as a dated dud. Its theme tune “Mona Lisa”, sung by Ukrainian jazz trumpeter and bandleader Charlie Spivak, is the surviving glory of the film, however. It became a global hit when it was covered in 1950 by Nat King Cole. Ray Evans wrote the poignant lyrics – “Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa? Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?” – and realised the song, comparing a lover to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, would work as a showcase for Cole’s warm baritone voice. Cole’s splendid version was at No.1 for eight weeks. In the year it won, incidentally, “Mona Lisa” beat the Disney novelty song “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” from Cinderella.1010  1) “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz, 1939)Although “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” is not a straightforward love song, it is a ballad about hope and loving humanity itself, a song that co-writer Yip Harburg called an attempt to “create a rainbow world”, where the dreams you dare to dream really do come true. It was the song Ariana Grande picked to perform at the ‘One Love Manchester’ concert in 2017 for the victims of the terrorist attack. Remarkably, this 20th-century classic, whose melody was composed by Harold Arlen, was almost cut from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, because MGM were worried that the opening Kansas sequence was too long. Sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s sublime version, orchestrated by Murray Cutter, wowed cinema-goers and the decision to leave it in was vindicated. Lady Gaga sings a brief section of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star is Born.110 10) “Up Where We Belong (An Officer and A Gentleman, 1982)1982 was a year of blockbuster movie songs and “Up Where We Belong” pipped “Eye of the Tiger” to Oscars glory. Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche wrote it for the Richard Gere movie An Officer and A Gentleman. It was sung as a duet after Jennifer Warnes suggested a collaboration with Joe Cocker. Warnes had been a fan of the late Cocker since her teenage years and said she cried out with joy when he accepted the invitation to work with her. Their version was a worldwide hit and also won a Golden Globe and a Grammy.In Swing Time, Fred Astaire sings the gorgeous ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” to Ginger Rogers while she is washing her hair. The sentimental lyrics were written by the brilliant songwriter Dorothy Fields, whose credits include “A Fine Romance” and “The Sunny Side of the Street”. The song, with music composed by Jerome Kern, was up against some terrific competition in 1936 – beating “Pennies from Heaven” and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” to an award in its third year. Billie Holiday, with jazz maestro Teddy Wilson on piano, had a hit with “The Way You Look Tonight” that year and the song has since been recorded by hundreds of best-selling singers, including Frank Sinatra. “The Way You Look Tonight” is popular, romantic songwriting at its very best.Sammy Fain’s formal love ballads epitomised the style of movie music in the 1950s. Fain won the Academy award for best song twice – for “Secret Love”, from the 1953 Doris Day movie Calamity Jane and, two years later, with the title song for Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing. Fain, a trained pianist, started out as song promoter in the 1920s and he was pragmatic about delivering the song studio bosses wanted for this William Holden movie. Fain and lyricist Paul Francis Webster constantly tinkered with the words in “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” to keep 20th Century-Fox happy. The song, performed by The Four Aces on the soundtrack, has remained a favourite of crooners, from Sinatra to Barry Manilow. The song has also been referenced in numerous modern films, including Grease and Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.410 7) “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” (The Lion King 1994)In songwriting terms, it was essentially Elton John v Randy Newman in 1994. Newman was nominated for “Make Up Your Mind” for The Paper and John for three songs from The Lion King (his other nominations were for the songs “The Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata”). “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”, co-written with Tim Rice, was a popular winner and the single sold 11 million copies. Canadian Céline Dion’s power ballad “My Heart Will Go On”, the theme song to James Cameron’s hit film Titanic, has been bought more than 20 million times. “My Heart Will Go On” is the romantic ballad playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embrace at the front of the ill-fated liner that crashed into a iceberg. Dion showed great technical skill coping with the tricky modulations of a song written by James Horner and Will Jennings, while the poignant tin-whistle playing is courtesy of Andrea Corr.Top Gun was virtually completed when Tom Whitlock came up with the lyrics to “Take My Breath Away” as he was driving home from work and mulling on a melody Giorgio Moroder had composed. The agreed they had something good and made a demo to play for director Tony Scott. He called back Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis to shoot some new love scenes to go with the new song. “If you see those scenes, you\u0027ll notice that they are lit differently and there are those gauzy curtains blowing around,” Whitlock told rediscoverthe80s “All of that was to disguise that some months had gone by and the actors didn\u0027t look exactly the same.”710 4) “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (The Woman in Red, 1984)In 1984, another year of popular movie title songs (“Ghostbusters” and “Footloose” were in the running), the Oscar went to Stevie Wonder’s “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. Wonder said that he had the late John Lennon in mind for a song he claimed he had first thought of in 1976. “I had the melody and lyric for the chorus, and I imagined in my mind when hearing the chords that The Beatles were singing with me. And that idea and feeling is what inspired me to use the vocoder.” The song was written for the movie The Woman in Red, a mediocre comedy starring Gene Wilder. In 2018, singer-songwriter John Prine recorded a slow, stripped-down version of the song for Spotify Singles, in which he brings out the essential charm of a ballad some find too saccharine. Wonder’s winner was a particular favourite of the writer Maya Angelou810 3) “Moon River” (Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 1961)In Blake Edwards’s film of the Truman Capote novel Breakfast at Tiffany’s, there is a scene in which the love interest Audrey Hepburn sits on the fire escape at a New York apartment and accompanies herself on guitar singing “Moon River”. The scene is charming and the waif-like Hepburn, staying in tune and doing her best with a singing voice that was thin and limited in range, delivers a moving version of a song written for her by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.The film noir Captain Carey, U.S.A, a tale of revenge set in the aftermath of the Second World War that starred Alan Ladd, is regarded now as a dated dud. Its theme tune “Mona Lisa”, sung by Ukrainian jazz trumpeter and bandleader Charlie Spivak, is the surviving glory of the film, however. It became a global hit when it was covered in 1950 by Nat King Cole. Ray Evans wrote the poignant lyrics – “Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa? Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?” – and realised the song, comparing a lover to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, would work as a showcase for Cole’s warm baritone voice. Cole’s splendid version was at No.1 for eight weeks. In the year it won, incidentally, “Mona Lisa” beat the Disney novelty song “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” from Cinderella.1010  1) “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz, 1939)Although “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” is not a straightforward love song, it is a ballad about hope and loving humanity itself, a song that co-writer Yip Harburg called an attempt to “create a rainbow world”, where the dreams you dare to dream really do come true.

Sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s sublime version, orchestrated by Murray Cutter, wowed cinema-goers and the decision to leave it in was vindicated. Lady Gaga sings a brief section of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star is Born.In the 1850s, he began composing symphonic poems and worked as the conductor of the Gothenburg Philharmonic in Sweden. Over the next decade, Smetana returned to Prague, where his first opera,\u0026nbspBraniboři v Čechách (The Brandenburgers in Bohemia), opened in 1866.A second opera titled\u0026nbspProdaná\u0026nbspNevěsta (The Bartered Bride) followed that same year, bringing success to the composer.Smetana lost his hearing in 1874 as a result of illness (syphilis, per the Encyclopaedia Britannica) but kept working.Between 1874 and 1879, he wrote a series of six tone poems titled\u0026nbspMá Vlast (My Country), which remain known by many to this day.Vltava\u0026nbsp(The Moldau)\u0026nbspembodies Smetana’s love of his hometown and echoes the flow of the\u0026nbspVltava river, also known by its German name Moldau.\u0026nbspTowards the end of his life, Smetana entered a mental health facility in Prague, where he died on 12 May, 1884.In addition to his operas and symphonic poems, Smetana is also celebrated for his highly regarded piano compositions.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years. Brexit is the last straw for young people – so give us a Final SayEU net migration drops to 10-year low ahead of BrexitWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?I’ve resigned my position in the Tory party over Brexit- here’s whyWhile it is difficult to make\u0026nbspdefinitive forecasts about the grocery landscape due to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, Kantar said: “The sector faces medium-term challenges around sourcing adequate levels of staff, particularly in London and potentially also in Northern Ireland. “This will disproportionately affect grocery retailers with large portions of their estate in London but may yet be relieved to some extent if UK immigration remains open to EU nationals and even expands to allow easier employment of overseas nationals hailing from beyond the EU.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Levels of snacking have\u0026nbspincreased. More people are taking lunch boxes into work, rather than buying from sandwich shops or the canteen, because it’s cheaper. The eating out boom of recent years has slowed dramatically.\u0026nbspIt appears that the ‘we’ll be alright if we just keep calm and carry on’ propaganda is being taken with a pinch of salt.\u0026nbspEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcastUK supermarkets lowering standards ahead of Brexit, study showsNo wonder. Kantar makes the point that, according to the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs, in 1988 domestic foods accounted for 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of all of what was consumed in Britain. Today, that figure has fallen to 50 per cent, or half.\u0026nbspMuch of the new consumption has arrived from the European Union, from where 62 per cent of all free foods are imported. In the absence of a deal, or a Brexit delay, in less than a month from now the smooth, uninterrupted flow of that food Britain enjoys through its membership of the single market will come to a juddering halt.\u0026nbspThat’s a big problem because while UK consumers may say they like the idea of buying locally, their buying habits speak otherwise. For example, just 41 per cent of the strawberries bought in Britain are consumed during their June, July and August season. The remainder is imported out of season, some from Europe or North Africa, some from further afield.\u0026nbspRetailers have done their best to respond. Range reviews have been conducted. We don’t tend to notice, but they regularly change through the year. They are changing now in ways they don’t usually change. Imported ranges have, for example, been simplified. Tesco has stated that it didn’t return fridges it rented during Christmas. It and Lidl have said that they’ll be hiring extra customs officials to get their produce fast tracked. Investments have been made in software and logistics planning.\u0026nbspMoney has also been spent on beefing up security too. One of the more specious arguments against a second referendum is it would cause social unrest. A no deal would all but guarantee it. It would brutally expose the lies told by Britain’s politicians.\u0026nbspIt would be remiss of me not to note that there will be some positives, and they may persist if Britain avoids the looming cliff edge. They include supermarkets becoming less likely to reject ‘wonky’ or odd shaped veg (although that was already in train) and their efforts persuade shoppers to eat seasonally. Packaging may reduce, and the top to bottom reviews some retailers have conducted of their businesses will serve them well whatever.\u0026nbspHowever, as a palliative these are rather like taking a paracetamol to deal with the after effects of major surgery.Kantar’s report is a superlative piece of work. Its authors, Fraser McKevitt and Ray Gaul, are to be commended.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The things they highlight in their report - things that are happening right now - wouldn\u0027t have just been dismissed as ‘Project Fear’ during the EU referendum. They would have been laughed out of town. So Remain didn\u0027t mention them.\u0026nbspThe report further serves to\u0026nbspdemonstrate\u0026nbspthe fallacy of the no dealers simplistic case.

Overnight, it robbed him of his confidence and his work as a commercial tyre fitter. He became housebound, unable even to make a cup of tea, and so depressed that one evening he found himself on a bridge near his home in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, Wales, contemplating suicide.\u0026nbspThat was four years ago. Now Mr Ricketts is helping other people suffering from disabilities and loneliness with the Llanelli Visually Impaired Bowls Club. The bowls club has flourished since Mr Ricketts founded it in 2016. This year, they are raising money to attend a national championship in Weston-Super-Mare.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts is also working with the local Men’s Sheds\u0026nbspcharity and\u0026nbspStreet Buddies, a volunteer scheme for residents to get involved in the community. For some of this work, he is paid in time credits, a form of community currency that can be exchanged for tickets to concerts and access to parks and leisure centres.“It’s given me a real boost,” he says. “It’s a way to pay people for help without using money and it makes me feel really good, because I’m giving something back.”What is Venezuela’s new currency system?The stock exchange for goods and skills in GlasgowTime credits in the UK are issued by Tempo (formerly known as Spice). The charity was founded in 2008 at the the Wales Institute for Community Currencies. In their original form, time credits were an experiment to help rebuild\u0026nbspthe ex-mining communities of south Wales.Time credits offer an alternative way to reward work that is traditionally unpaid at a time when local authorities are relying on communities to step in and provide care for the lonely and vulnerable. They should never replace paid work, but time credits\u0026nbspmight give meaning or value to an exchange with a person with disabilities, mental health or addiction issues who could struggle to take part in the monetary economy.\u0026nbspIn times of crisis, such as in Argentina at the turn of the millennium or during the Greek financial crisis, barter economies and community currencies can facilitate exchanges between people when the monetary economy fails. \u0026nbspSome 50,000 people have since earned 700,000 time credits since 2008. Mr Ricketts says the scheme has huge potential in areas of low income by helping community groups give back to volunteers. Families awarded time credits can use the scheme to take advantage of daytrips and leisure activities that might otherwise be beyond their reach.\u0026nbsp“I have seen the potential of them for families with low incomes,” he says. He has been known to give some of his own time credits to people when he sees them counting the pennies to buy a cup of tea.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts always keeps some time credits in his pockets. Given his condition, that can cause confusion. “They look and feel like the new plastic fivers,” he says. “Because I can’t see I have been known to try and pay for a pint with time credits in the pub.”Similar schemes around the UK encourage people to swap their time or labour for time in kind. In Hull, the HullCoin rewards people for getting involved in community action with a digital currency that can be used to get discounts with local businesses. Many cities also have a time-banking network co-ordinated by Timebanking UK. Time-banking is rooted in the idea that every person has something to contribute to their community, regardless of their circumstances.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

He says time credits are a way to enable people like Stephen Ricketts to take a role in their community by recognising the efforts that go into volunteering. The scheme also gets new people into volunteering. Half of people earning time credits have have volunteered before.“People volunteer for its own sake and that’s fine,” Mr Merrill says. “But we know that time credits bring people into volunteering who wouldn’t already do it.”\u0026nbspMr Ricketts says he uses time credits at bowls to thank personal assistants for extra jobs, like making a round of tea, putting out biscuits for the players, or cleaning up afterwards. “After a bit of time, I found out the assistants had children and they were taking them swimming, so when they wanted to take their family out to a leisure part or a theatre, I gave them the time credits to cover it,” he says.Volunteers can currently spend their time credits golfing at Pembrey Park in Wales, learning to paddleboard in Essex, or on hair and beauty treatments at participating salons. They can also be exchanged for short courses at some college and classes to learn how to act or how to cook healthier meals.What really forces currency markets and exchange rates to change?Simon, whose last name is withheld, earned his first time credits with the Haringey Project, which helps people with mental health problems or substance misuse. He earned credits volunteering with gardening when he lived in St Mungo’s Hostel for two years. With the credits he earned, he took his mother on outings to Tower Bridge, Keat’s House and Kensington Palace.\u0026nbsp“I’ve taken my mum to places she’s never been to before,” he says. “I went on lots of trips with time credits this August, it was the best August of my whole life.”Tempo is now looking at harnessing technology to bring time credits to more people. Mr Merrill says time credits could become ever more important in the UK during tightened economic circumstances. “Time credits enables people to address needs in their own communities,” he says. “If they can help unlock capacity and create connections that weren’t there before, those are good things.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years.

Actually, it’s a two-man show: most of the landscape paintings in this exhibition are by David Hockney, but they’re juxtaposed with landscapes by one of his great artistic heroes: Vincent van Gogh.“He’s one of the great, great draughtsmen of all time,”Hockney, fielding questions from a crowd of journalists, who’ve flown in from all around the world. “The drawings are fantastic – he could see space very clearly.” And the paintings are something else. “Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really look.”Hockney is wearing a natty flat cap and a lime green cardigan – he’s always been a stylish dresser. He seems cheerful and contented – he’s always been comfortable in his own skin. However he looks older and frailer than he did a few years ago, and he talks a lot more slowly. This should come as no surprise – he is 81, after all – but somehow it’s still a shock. With his boyish good looks, he was the Peter Pan of Pop Art. Even in late middle age, he seemed a lot younger than his years. Now he finally looks his age, but we should be thankful he’s still alive and still painting. If Van Gogh had lived as long as Hockney, he would have still been alive in the 1930s.“I’ve been deeply influenced by Van Gogh – it’s very visible in this show,” he says. “Van Gogh, to me, is a contemporary artist. Any artist that speaks to you is a contemporary artist. Brueghel is a contemporary artist to me.” Another big influence in his life has been Van Gogh’s letters to his brother Theo. “They’re marvellous,” he says. “If it had been 10 years later he might have been on the phone and the letters wouldn’t exist.”Hockney’s first encounter with Van Gogh was back in 1955, when he was a student at Bradford School of Art. The art school arranged a trip to a Van Gogh exhibition in Manchester, and Hockney was blown away by the energy, the vitality, the joie de vivre of his paintings. “I was 16 years old and I’d just started at the art school,” he recalls. “I thought, ‘Well, he’s quite a rich artist, because he could use two whole tubes of blue to paint the sky’. Not even teachers at the art school could afford that!”Created with Sketch.David Hockney\u0027s first brushes with genius Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)It was the colour that moved him most of all. “I’d never seen paintings like that before – at the art school everybody just painted grey pictures of Bradford. There was not much colour at all. At first I thought he’d probably exaggerated some colour, but now I don’t think so.” Sixty-four years later, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world’s largest collection of Van Gogh’s work, has had the bright idea of juxtaposing a large array of Hockney’s Yorkshire landscape paintings with a smaller selection of Van Gogh’s landscapes, painted in the 1880s in the south of France. Hockney is flattered by this association. “Van Gogh is a terrific inspiration.”Of course there are some similarities between Van Gogh’s woods and wheat fields and Hockney’s, but this show isn’t about narrow comparisons, of style or subject matter. It’s about their shared love of light. Above all, it’s about their lust for life. They’re both artists who adore the natural world, and paint it compulsively. “They’re just so joyful,” he says, of Van Gogh’s landscapes. You could say the same of his. Fittingly, the show is called The Joy of Nature.As Hockney says, it’s a far better title than Dave and Vince. It’s ironic that such joyful paintings were made by a man who chose to kill himself, but that paradox is part of what makes Van Gogh so compelling. “He was joyful when he painted – I know that, because that’s what he loved.”‘Kilham to Langtoft II’, 27 July 2005, oil on canvas (David Hockney)This exhibition also represents a kind of renaissance, for Hockney’s landscape paintings, like Van Gogh’s, were cut short by a tragic, self-inflicted death. In March 2013, one of Hockney’s assistants, Dominic Elliott, died from drinking toilet cleaner in Hockney’s home in Bridlington, the Yorkshire seaside town where Hockney had been living intermittently since the early Noughties. Hockney was entirely blameless, but he’d been asleep in the house when it happened, and the shock was immense. He sold the house and moved back to Los Angeles, his adopted home for the past 30 years. For several months, he was unable to paint at all.In July 2013 Hockney sent a picture to his friend and curator Edith Devaney. It was a portrait of his close friend and studio manager, Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima, sitting in Hockney’s LA studio, his head buried in his hands. Straight away, Devaney spotted the similarity with Van Gogh’s Old Man in Sorrow. This wasn’t just a portrait, Hockney told her – it was also a sort of self-portrait.This portrait led to many more, and the result was his 2016 exhibition, 82 Portraits and One Still Life, at London’s Royal Academy, curated by Devaney. After the trauma of Elliot’s sudden death, Van Gogh helped to bring Hockney back into painting. And now Van Gogh has brought his Yorkshire landscapes, cruelly curtailed by that tragic accident, back to life.Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really lookThe selection was mainly made by the Van Gogh Museum, but Hockney did ask them to include The Road to York through Sledmere, which he painted a decade earlier, as homage to his friend Jonathan Silver. Silver revived Salts Mill in Saltaire, Yorkshire, as a cultural centre (and as a museum of Hockney’s work). He died of pancreatic cancer in 1997, aged just 48. When Silver was very ill, Hockney spent a lot of time with him.He asked Silver if there was anything he could do for him. Silver asked him to paint east Yorkshire – a subtler landscape than West Yorkshire, where Hockney was born and raised. “That picture was painted when Jonathan Silver was dying, and I was driving constantly from Bridlington to Saltaire, and I always went through Sledmere,” remembers Hockney. “It’s always been on my wall.”English landscape paintings are often muted, a blur of browns and greys. Hockney’s English landscapes are glowing – bursting with bright colours and brilliant light. “I’d lived in California for 30 years. It’s bound to have an effect. But I don’t think I exaggerated the colour that much – no, I don’t think so. I think it’s there, but you have to look – hard. Colour is a very fugitive thing.”As he says, we all see colour differently. Some people see it more intensely. Hockney’s intense vision makes us look closer and the world look brighter. “When you’re looking at the world, there’s so much to see.”David Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937, the fourth of five children. During the war his father Kenneth was a conscientious objector, which meant that when he lost his job, as a clerk, he wasn’t eligible for national assistance. He subsequently scratched a living renovating old prams. David drew from an early age, in chalk on the kitchen floor and in pencil in his brothers’ comics.In 1947 he won a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School. He didn’t shine at school, which was just as well. If he’d been top of the class his teachers might have pushed him into a more respectable occupation. “He should realise that ability in and enthusiasm for art alone is not enough to make a career for him,” wrote his teacher on his school report.Fortunately for Hockney, and the rest of us, he paid no attention to his teachers. He went to Bradford College of Art, which gave him a solid foundation in skills like life drawing, then on to the Royal College of Art, in London, where he found his voice. He came out as gay – a brave move in an era when homosexuality was still illegal – and his work blossomed. He made his first visit to America, and returned with his hair dyed blonde, after seeing a TV ad for Clairol which claimed that “blondes have more fun”.By the time Hockney left the Royal College he was already represented by a Bond Street gallery. He moved into a two-room flat in London’s Notting Hill, still a rundown area back then. He slept in one room and used the other room as his studio. His immense talent was bolstered by his insatiable appetite for hard work. GET UP AND WORK IMMEDIATELY was painted in big block capitals on the chest of drawers at the foot of his bed.His first solo show in 1963 earned him enough money to spend a year in America. As he told his friend Henry Geldzahler, he never felt lonely over there. He spent some time in New York but he was drawn to Los Angeles, where he’s lived, off and on, ever since.“Southern California has a marvellous clarity in the light. That’s why Hollywood is there. I always loved the place. I never got bored of it.” The sun-drenched pictures he painted there would have been inconceivable in Britain. “In a cold place like Bradford you hardly see anybody without their clothes on,” he once remarked.Hockney painting ‘May Blossom on the Roman Road’, 2009 (Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima)Then as now, LA is commonly derided by snobbish Brits (and New Yorkers) as a spiritual desert, devoid of culture, but Hockney saw a vivid, lively cityscape that no one else had painted, a city with “the only architecture in the world that makes you smile”. He took to calling himself an “English Los Angeleno”. He vowed to become the “Pirinesi of LA”.His LA paintings made his name, in Britain and America, particularly his swimming pool pictures like A Bigger Splash and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which last year became the most expensive painting by a living artist when it sold at Christie’s in New York for $90m (£68m).David Hockney interview: \u0027I thought I was a peripheral artist, really\u0027“The auction prices for my work have nothing to do with me – I ignore it,” he says, emphatically. “I think people have forgotten Oscar Wilde’s remark, ‘The only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer’.”He’s worked in all kinds of media, from film and photography to set design. He’s embraced every new innovation, from fax machines to smartphones. His iPad paintings were groundbreaking, proving that this new medium could be a new way to make great art.“The first things I did were lots of sunrises from a window, and I realised that with the iPad I could draw without moving from my bed. I didn’t have to get up to get water, or a brush, or pencils, and I could draw in the dark, because of the back light, so I started drawing just before the dawn.” He painted dozens of pictures of the sun rising, on his iPad, through the same bedroom window. “Every day was different, different colours. No two sunrises are the same.”Woldgate’, 2008, oil on 2 canvases (David Hockney)Yet despite his love of hi-tech, he’ll always be remembered as a painter, and a traditional painter at that. “Modern art generally ignores skills and crafts,” he once said, in an interview with Art Monthly. When abstract art was all the rage he flew the flag for figuration. When conceptual art was all the rage he flew the flag for fine art.“There’s a lot of the boring old northern art schoolmaster in what he says about representation versus abstraction,” wrote Tim Hilton, in . But as a new generation of artists rediscover draughtsmanship, it seems Hockney has been proved right.Despite his conventional views on art, he’s no reactionary fuddy-duddy. He was a tireless advocate for gay rights, long before such causes became chic. His friend Henry Geldzahler once wrote down a list of his faults and failings: stubborn hard of hearing unintentionally rude suffers fools gladly generous to a fault. It’s notable that several of these faults are actually virtues.It’s hard to find an artist who’s so universally admired. And after all these years, his hunger for experience remains. “On Saturday I’m going off to Normandy to paint the arrival of spring,” he says. “I can’t think of anything better than watching the spring happen in Normandy in 2019.”Hockney – Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature is at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (vangoghmuseum.nl) until 26 MayWe’ll tell you what’s true.

AI is everywhere, its proponents claim – if it\u0027s not somewhere already, then it\u0027s about to be.And the latest place it has arrived is perhaps the most personal yet: in your mouth. Oral B\u0027s latest toothbrush hopes to bring the power of AI and machine learning to your teeth, using artificial intelligence to coach you into brushing your teeth better.It\u0027s not the first toothbrush to use technology usually preserved for mobile phones and other gadgets to make sure your brushing is as effective as possible. But Oral-B thinks it is the smartest, and the brush has a fitting name: the Genius X.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe toothbrush was revealed in Barcelona this week at Mobile World Congress, an event usually focused on phones. This year, many of the exhibitions focused on foldable handsets and 5G.Oral-B staked its claim not only on the basis of its smart toothbrush but also its general vision of the future of healthcare and its connection to dental hygiene. That vision included a full-scale smart mirror, which could be controlled by people\u0027s hand movements and showed information about the day to come and the overall health of the person using it.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightOral-B does already have a toothbrush that relies on some smart features: the Genius. That too operates as a brushing coach as well as a brush itself, watching how you clean your teeth and encouraging you to avoid bad habits and ensure your entire mouth is brushed.Scientists developing toothbrush to diagnose deadly heart problemsTo know where it is, the toothbrush uses built-in sensors that build on a host of experimental work to understand how people brush. The company put huge numbers of people in front of a camera and asked them to brush, feeding that information into an algorithm that allows the toothbrush to know where it is, no matter which of the widely varying ways of brushing their teeth that people use.But it does so using your phone\u0027s camera, meaning that you have to stick a special holder\u0026nbspto your mirror and then stick your phone inside. When it\u0027s there, it can watch the brush as it moves around in your mouth, monitoring where exactly you are brushing and where needs extra work.That is a rather complicated process that requires a fairly complicated process just to brush your teeth, and might not always work if the phone doesn\u0027t have the right view. Instead, the Genius removes some of that: it just needs to be within Bluetooth distance of your phone, and then will relay information that is displayed on your handset.In the app – which was available to use at MWC, in a booth that let visitors brush their teeth – all of that information is displayed. Brushers are given a score, which factors in whether they press too hard and how long they brush for as well as how effective and complete their coverage was.Over time, people are encouraged to improve that score by better brushing their teeth. Those scores can be viewed historically through the app, which also keeps data on things such as how often your gums bleed.The Genius X is due to be released later this year and pricing has not yet been announced.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Due to a lack of knowledge about the past climate of Mars, scientists\u0026nbspcan not tell whether it came from\u0026nbspgroundwater, precipitation,\u0026nbspmelting glaciers or something unheard of.There is no liquid water on the surface of mars today, though plenty of similar ex-water features\u0026nbsphave been discovered in recent years, suggesting Mars once had a far wetter and warmer climate.Each discovery raises further questions about the planet\u0027s past atmosphere and\u0026nbspscientists ultimately want to know whether or not it would have been suitable for life.Next year the ESA in collaboration with Russia’s space program Roscomos will launch the ExoMars mission with the primary goal to “address the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars.Here The Independent has collated images\u0026nbspfrom recently discovered evidence of water on Mars in the gallery above.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Ms Wong made the discovery after coming across\u0026nbspthe words “Hide Tweet” in the app’s code, which Twitter later confirmed to be the new feature.“Thanks to Jane and @MattNavarra for starting the conversation about this feature we are developing. We wanted to provide a little more context on it,” Twitter’s senior product manager Yasmeen Haq\u0026nbspwrote on Twitter.“We often hear from heavy Tweeters that they want to be able to protect their conversations. People who start interesting conversations on Twitter are really important to us, and we want to empower them to make the conversations they start as healthy as possible by giving them some control.”Twitter is secretly keeping hold of deleted DMsTwitter is ‘thinking about’ a new edit featureMs Haq\u0026nbspexplained how Twitter categorises\u0026nbspconversations as an ecosystem containing\u0026nbspfour different groups: Authors, repliers, the audience and the platform. “We try to balance the experience across all four groups, and we are continuously exploring ways to shift the balance without overcorrecting.”She added: “We think the transparency of the hidden replies would allow the community to notice and call out situations where people use the feature to hide content they disagree with.“We think this can balance the product experience between the original Tweeter and the audience.”Twitter said it planned\u0026nbspto start testing the new Hide Tweet feature publicly “in the coming months”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I felt like I was there again... And I wanted to die. I wanted to die.”Paul Douglas had been in Colnbrook removal centre for a matter of days when he was ordered to pack up to get on a charter flight. The words set him into panic mode. He locked his door and began to cut his wrists. All he could see was the vision of his aunt getting shot dead in the street 20 years before – after she too was deported back to Jamaica.The officers eventually broke into the 30-year-old’s cell and found him unconscious in a pool of blood. Instead of being driven to the flight on 4 February, he was rushed to hospital where he got 22 stitches. After several days, he was discharged and taken straight back to detention – where he is still subject to removal.Paul was just nine when he witnessed his aunt’s murder. With neither of his parents around, she had been his main carer until she was forced to flee to England after becoming a target of the gang warfare that dominated their local area. But the Home Office refused her asylum claim and sent her back – and days after returning she was shot dead.Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushGrowing up in a Kingston neighbourhood with one of the highest crime rates on the island, death was nothing new to Paul. “On the way to school I’d see dead bodies,” he recalls.\u0026nbsp“You’d hear gunshots\u0026nbspbut you became immune to it. When you’re living in and around it, you find a way. I learned to close my eyes and pretend I was in a better place.”But the murder\u0026nbspof his aunt\u0026nbspwas the wakeup call for his relatives –\u0026nbspand when their home was shot at weeks after the murder, they decided to place Paul on a flight destined for the UK.Despite the painful memories, Paul quickly settled into life in London\u0026nbspand began to flourish, excelling academically and seizing on opportunities to learn. He achieved good grades in his GCSEs and was planning to study engineering at college.At the age of 16, though, he was wrenched back to the violence and death he witnessed in his formative years. An altercation with another teenager that began at school – which Paul says he had not wanted to take part in – escalated into a street fight between two groups. During the fracas, a 16-year-old was fatally stabbed.The judge acknowledged Paul did not strike the fatal blow, but the jury decided he and two other boys were jointly responsible. Paul was sentenced to 12 years in jail for “joint enterprise”.“We went from aspiring young boys\u0026nbspto black boys in a gang,” he says. “There was a lot of talk of gang culture during the trial. That was the last thing I wanted.“Coming from such a violent place, I always used to say when I was growing up that I never wanted to be like the people I grew up around. I tried so hard. I never engaged in violence. Up until this point I had never been arrested. I was trying to get somewhere in my life.”Despite the devastation and anger that came with knowing he would be spending the rest of his youth and much of his early adulthood in jail, Paul’s empathy for the victim’s family helped him come to terms with his fate.“Regardless of the situation, someone lost their life,” he says. “I had to think about the boy’s family – a mum, a dad, sisters, brothers. They were suffering. I had to put myself in their position to understand. In this situation there were no winners.”He decided to try to take a positive approach to prison, continuing\u0026nbsphis education behind bars\u0026nbspas well as successfully engaging\u0026nbspin rehabilitation programmes and acting as\u0026nbspa mentor for younger inmates.“There was a lot of emotion. At the time I was young. You just see your future disappear. I knew I wouldn’t be able to experience a lot of things that young people my age did.\u0026nbspI was angry at the system, but I found that that got me nowhere. I couldn’t argue against it. You have to learn to just get on with it.”ColnbrookFourteen years on, after completing his sentence with a glowing report from the parole board, Paul was\u0026nbspsetting up a home to share with his pregnant\u0026nbspgirlfriend, Chanel\u0026nbspGebon,\u0026nbspin time for the birth of their first child.But his\u0026nbsplong-awaited freedom was\u0026nbspcut short when he was detained by the Home Office for the first time on the day he was supposed to be attending his unborn daughter’s ultrasound scan. He was taken to Colnbrook, where he was later told he was to be deported to Jamaica.Chanel, 28, who is a British national, says losing\u0026nbspPaul just before\u0026nbspgiving birth\u0026nbsppushed her into a “dark place”. A week or so after he was\u0026nbspdetained, she went into labour.“It was something we’d always been talking about, how the birth would be. We were really looking forward to the moment,” she\u0026nbspsays. “But I had to do it all without him – just hearing his voice on the end of the phone. It was horrible.“Everything we had planned was positive. Paul\u0026nbspisn’t someone who would want to hurt or upset anyone at all. From the moment he came out, he’s been supportive to so many people. He’s done his time. He’s a lot more mature now – he has goals. Everyone deserves a second chance.”Her words are echoed by\u0026nbspSonya Russo, director of offender behaviour programme Plan B, who worked with Paul during his jail term until the present day, and\u0026nbspwas on the phone to him while he was self-harming in his cell after hearing about\u0026nbspthe charter flight. She\u0026nbspsays the 30-year-old is an “absolute asset” to the community.“Paul has turned things around and survived a 12-year sentence,” Sonya adds. “He has a big impact in the work we do, because he’s obviously relatable to the boys that we teach. What’s happening to him is just awful. Especially his current condition.”Volunteering with the\u0026nbspcharity, Paul has supported young men who have been released from jail, helped them settle\u0026nbspback into the community, and\u0026nbspadvised prison governors about the best way\u0026nbspof teaching inmates – as well as working\u0026nbspwith child victims of the\u0026nbspGrenfell\u0026nbspTower fire.“We’ve got a full-time job for him as soon as we’re allowed to employ him,” says Sonya.\u0026nbsp“He\u0026nbspsettled into a new life after prison and then boom, he’s back in these conditions again – it’s like he’s gone full circle. Since he was a small child he’s had it rough, and he’s losing hope that he’s ever going to be OK.”Home secretary urged to apologise over ‘serious crime’ deportee claimsDespite initial claims by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, that\u0026nbspdeportees were all guilty of “very serious crimes” such as murder and rape, Paul was among a minority of them who had actually been convicted of such an offence.\u0026nbspBut even in his case the\u0026nbspfacts point to a more complex story. The 30-year-old is reduced to tears when he talks about his threat of deportation.“Everything was good. I was finally getting the opportunity to almost live my life. To be suddenly picked up like this and be in this position, I’m mindblown,” says Paul. “I got released by a High Court judge. The judge deemed me not a risk to the public. I walked out of prison with my bags on my back.“Working with young offenders\u0026nbspmade me feel some kind of purpose. I changed some kids’ lives dramatically after speaking to them.\u0026nbspBut they\u0026nbspjust look at what’s on paper. They say they need to protect the public because this person is very dangerous, but they don’t look at the facts. No one wants\u0026nbspto listen.”Harking back to his aunt’s murder,\u0026nbspwhich came flooding back to him when immigration officers came to put him on a flight back to Jamaica, leading him to cut his wrists,\u0026nbspPaul says openly:\u0026nbsp“That wasn’t self-harm. I wanted to kill myself.“The Home Office was told my aunty was at risk of death, but they removed her and allowed it to happen. Now I am in the same position, showing them all the records and everything. It’s like there are\u0026nbspno lessons learned.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“Mr Douglas has no legal right to remain in the UK and has been convicted of murder.“The law requires that we seek to deport foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK. This ensures we keep the public safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

elects new MEPs, lawyers are warning, appearing to torpedo Theresa May’s strategy.Article 50 cannot be extended beyond the end of May unless the UK takes part in fresh European parliament elections, according to a legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag.The conclusion came amid fresh evidence that the exit talks remain in trouble, with a lack of progress that might persuade MPs to approve the prime minister’s deal.The controversy over European elections is crucial\u0026nbspbecause Ms May told MPs a delay to June would be possible without a U-turn on withdrawing MEPs – if parliament forces her to abandon the 29 March deadline.A proposal to keep seats in the parliament would trigger uproar among Conservatives who are already angry\u0026nbspover the Commons being granted a veto over a no-deal Brexit.Post-Brexit US trade demands ‘would allow in chlorinated chicken’However, the EU would almost certainly reject a delay of only two months as pointless, given it has not been possible to agree an acceptable UK orce deal in two years of trying.The blow came as Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, is believed to have warned there has been no progress in the negotiations designed to secure changes to rescue the agreement.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with

exit mechanism from the Irish border backstop, which the EU has rejected, it was reported.On Tuesday, Ms May – while insisting she remained opposed to delaying Brexit – told MPs: “An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections.”However, the legal opinion warned of “a violation of the active and passive voting rights of British nationals” if there was a delay beyond 23-26 May, when the elections are held.Leave supporters to pay £50 to join Nigel Farage on Brexit marchEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcast“British citizens living in the UK would be denied a fundamental right conferred on them by citizenship of the European Union,” the German paper Die Welt quoted the advice as saying.They could take action in UK courts “in defence of their rights to vote and stand for election … in accordance with applicable national rules”.And EU citizens in the UK would also be prevented from “exercising their right to vote and stand in elections to the European parliament in their state of residence”, laying Britain open to possible action by the European Commission.The European Court of Justice could issue a preliminary ruling on “whether or not Britain’s non-participation in the European elections is legally permissible”.It is increasingly plausible that the EU will insist on a much longer extension – possibly 21 months, to allow a trade deal to be agreed while the UK is a member, avoiding the backstop controversy.This week, Emmanuel Macron hinted at that approach when he said France would block a Brexit delay unless it had a “clear objective” based on a “new choice” by the British.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There would have to be an extension that would be called ‘motivated’ or ‘technical’.Asked if an extension to Article 50 was the only option if a Brexit deal is to be finalised,\u0026nbsphe answered: “Yes, you could\u0026nbspsay that.”Mr Barnier said the EU would most likely agree to such an extension, but that member states\u0026nbspwould need to be convinced\u0026nbspthere was a good reason for it.\u0026nbspHe said: “The hypothetical duration would depend on what they want it for. I know there is the idea of ​​an extension without conditions, but you have to know\u0026nbspthat an extension would serve to fix a problem, not to delay the solution.“In my opinion, do not postpone the problem for three or six months, do not risk prolonging the general uncertainty of Europe beyond the elections, but it will be for the heads of state to respond.”Ms May’s hopes of securing the Commons’ backing for her deal rest on obtaining\u0026nbspfresh concessions from the EU on the backstop – the main source of opposition from Tory Brexiteers.Grayling faces parliamentary inquiries amid fresh calls to resignStephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, have been locked in talks with Brussels in a bid to secure legally binding guarantees that the backstop, which would see the UK enter into a customs union with the EU if a trade deal cannot be agreed, would be temporary.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Barnier said Brussels was open to giving further assurances that this is the case.\u0026nbspHe said: “We know that there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU.“This is not the case. And we are ready to give further guarantees, assurances and clarifications that the backstop should only be temporary.”He announced that the EU is considering providing the new guarantees in a\u0026nbspjoint\u0026nbspinterpretative document –\u0026nbspan add-on to the withdrawal agreement – saying this could enshrine assurances made in a letter from Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, in January.\u0026nbspMr Barnier said: “Guarantees, assurances, can be given in a document,\u0026nbspperhaps next to the treaty, not in the political declaration.“We can imagine an interpretative document, where there are elements such as those already in the letter from Tusk and Juncker. That was a letter from two presidents of two institutions. If the document is agreed with the United Kingdom, it would be much stronger.”However, he insisted that any new concessions will\u0026nbspnot include either a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK – a key demand of many Tory\u0026nbspEurosceptics.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbsp“There cannot be a temporality clause, as it is impossible for there to be a unilateral withdrawal from it.

However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

The prime minister told MPs that if the next “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement is defeated, then they will have the chance to vote for an extension of Article 50, thus\u0026nbspdelaying Brexit.Some Brexiteers –\u0026nbspfearing a lengthy delay to the exit process – may decide to climb down, even though their fundamental objection to the backstop remains.Still, plenty of pro-Brexit\u0026nbspMPs still argue the backstop must be time-limited, or replaced in its entirety. On balance, it seems likely that most\u0026nbspwill vote down the deal again, unless Ms May obtains significant concessions in the next fortnight.With no breakthrough in sight as Ms May’s officials\u0026nbspcontinue discussions with their counterparts in Brussels, it\u0026nbspremains an extraordinary (and probably\u0026nbspunlikely)\u0026nbsptask for the prime minister to overturn the biggest defeat in the modern British political history and secure MPs’ backing for her Brexit deal.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The decision to proceed is a formality and allows a judge to hear arguments on whether to grant the US\u0026nbsprequest.A decision to extradite ultimately must be approved by Canada\u0027s justice minister.“There is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision,” the statement said.The Chinese government criticised the decision as a “serious violation” of Ms Meng\u0027s rights and called on Washington to withdraw its extradition request.“The US\u0026nbspand Canada have abused their bilateral extradition agreement,” said a Foreign Ministry statement.The Huawei squeeze is tightening but does it really pose a risk?China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor\u0026nbspon 10 December\u0026nbspin an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Ms Meng.A Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Mr\u0026nbspKovrig and Mr Spavor haven\u0027t had access to a lawyer since being arrested.Ms Meng is living in one of two Vancouver mansions she owns.“We are disappointed that the Minister of Justice has decided to issue an Authority to Proceed in the face of the political nature of the US\u0026nbspcharges and where the president of the United States has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms\u0026nbspMeng\u0027s case if he thought it would assist the US negotiations with China over a trade deal,” said her lawyer, David Martin, in a statement.Martin said the charges against Ms Meng are not crimes in Canada and that his client maintains her innocence.US signals it will refuse to share information if UK uses HuaweiHuawei addresses spy concerns to UK governmentExplaining Huawei, the phone company both hated and lovedThe Chinese Embassy in Ottawa criticised the case in a statement as “a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise”.Huawei is a focus of US\u0026nbspsecurity concerns.Washington has pressured other countries to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.The US\u0026nbspand China have tried to keep Ms Meng\u0027s case separate from their wider trade dispute, but Donald Trump has undercut that. Mr Trump said he would consider intervening in the case against Ms Meng if it would be in the interest of US\u0026nbspnational security or help forge a trade deal with Beijing.The Chinese embassy statement that due to “obvious political interference”, Canada should refuse the US\u0026nbspextradition request and release Ms Meng.US\u0026nbspJustice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the department pursues cases “free of any political interference” and follows evidence and the law.Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Chinese authorities are not interested in hearing about how Canada is bound by its extradition case with the US.Saint-Jacques said China might apply further pressure on Canada.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But Labour’s more paralysing fear is more Remainer MPs abandoning the party. They have clearly decided to throw their Leavers under the bus.The party is now in desperate straits.It’s not just Brexit. For years it has rubbished claims that it has been over-run by racist anti-Semites and rabidly hard-Left conspiracy lunatics. Now ­Corbyn’s ally Jon Lansman, founder of Momentum, admits that it’s all true.“We have a major problem,” he says. “It is obvious we have a much larger number of people with hardcore anti-Semitic opinions... polluting the atmosphere in constituency parties and online.”Deputy Leader Tom Watson is in open revolt, launching a “party within a party” to prevent more moderates defecting.It may be too late. Corbyn’s own anti-Semitic extremism attracted all the racists and cranks who have forced out one Jewish MP and her colleagues. All the while he has faced both ways on Brexit.If he is about to pay the price for it all, it is well deserved.FOR too long we have allowed the supporters of terror to wave their sickening flags during protests on our streets.Enjoying free speech protections, they have spread the lies and vicious hatred of one of the world’s most violently anti-Western and anti-Semitic groups.Police have had to let goons march through London with Hezbollah banners emblazoned with an assault rle.Tory Home Secretary Sajid Javid has outlawed them entirely. Supporters could get ten years in jail.The Sun applauds him.Ours is a famously tolerant country.It will not stay that way unless we get tougher on those aiming to destroy it.YOU don’t normally achieve full “national treasure” status at just .But Olivia Colman — of Peep Show, Broadchurch, The Favourite and many more — did so even before she bagged her magnicent Best Actress Oscar.We all love a British winner.But who couldn’t warm to one so charming, down-to-earth and plain fun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie. Deceive. Betray. Dissemble. They can delay Brexitthey want but there will be no rebuilding the country’s trust. Not for years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But who really believes that MPs will prevent that too, maybe by backing the second referendum Labour now supports. A delay may well be fatal.We are outraged at the Cabinet Remainers and no-mark ministers who held the PM to ransom to secure a vote over halting No Deal. A clearout of this sorry bunch cannot come too soon.But it is plain that they are calling the shots now, not the ERG’s Brexiteers — despite the  claims of  Anna Soubry.All Tory MPs must remember this: Their party can avoid complete destruction — and indeed can capitalise on  Corbyn’s poll collapse — ONLY by  delivering Brexit. Yes, even Mrs May’s version . . . with an improved backstop.No Brexit leads to No Tories — and the collapse of our political system.IT beggars belief. A Labour Party already engulfed by an anti-Semitism crisis backs a violently anti-Semitic terrorist group.This is our official Opposition,  challenging the Home Secretary for more evidence that Hezbollah’s political wing should be banned from Britain.They’re not convinced by its own  deputy leader admitting there’s no dference between its politicians and its military wing, which is already banned.Nor by the catalogue of atrocities Hezbollah has carried out against  civilians, including children, in Syria.Nor by the fact it is dedicated to driving Jews from their homes.Corbyn and his  aide Seumas Milne won’t bend. They are two upper-class idiots who have spent all their pampered lives romanticising left-wing violence.And yet Labour still wants voters to believe it is not racist — and that our nation’s defence is safe in its hands.What a sick joke.WE commend Facebook, for once, for finally pulling the plug on Tommy Robinson.He may pose as a fearless truth-seeker exercising his right to free speech.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”. They know she faces another inevitable and painful leadership challenge by the end of the year — they want to see her leave with her dignity intact.It’s likely Brussels will eventually give some reassurance on the backstop.This might not quite be the full ­open-heart surgery changes to the deal some want.But the test should be whether the legal position changes. If it does, then the deal deserves to pass.And then, come the end of March, we can stop endlessly re-running referendum arguments about whether we should or shouldn’t leave the EU.We can get on with arguing about what sort of country we want to be after Brexit.We can discuss what we want to do with our newly won ­freedoms.And as a country we can start to move on together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a shareholder in hundreds of ­companies, from Greggs and ­Wetherspoons through to Superdry and Moneysupermarket.The UK is already the third-largest destination for this Norwegian investment, and now they’re putting in more.It seems almost surprising, given the endless choruses of woe about Brexit and the pathetic state of our political class in Westminster. Who would want to bet on a country where the job of economic cheerleader is held by Philip Hammond, and the ­alternative is an out-and-out Marxist like John McDonnell The answer is that the Norwegians can see what we sometimes miss about our own country: The UK is a fantastic place to do business.Our legal system is respected around the world for its fairness and is viewed as a “gold standard” under which to sign contracts and do deals.Our corporate taxes are competitive, and are set to fall further. Our location and time zone help to make us a good bridge into markets around the world.Our language is spoken by billions of people, and is the chosen tongue of global business.Our culture is one that still prizes innovation and hard work, despite the best efforts of some Chancellors over the years.And most of all, our people — our greatest asset — are skilled and creative, as employers, inventors and workers alike.It doesn’t come naturally for us to blow our own trumpets and talk ourselves up, so sometimes it feels a bit awkward to ­consider the many things we have going for us.And we all love a good moan, to the degree that it’s essentially a national sport. But we should be careful that we don’t go too far and start to talk ­ourselves down.There’s a dference between being modest and acting like Eeyore with a hangover. Brexit in particular seems to have driven some people a bit loopy, so that you hear some who were once quite ­sensible now ranting about “destroying the country” or “falling off a clf edge”.To hear them, you would think we are a repellent disaster zone, about to slip beneath the waves never to be seen again, like Atlantis crossed with Towie.This is obviously ridiculous. Of course it’s possible that the process of leaving the EU will be dficult.Thanks to politicians who are still ­incapable of honouring their promises and agreeing a clear way forward, the uncertainty about our future ­relationship with our European neighbours has been allowed to drag on for far too long.But it isn’t Brussels, or even Westminster, that made this country wealthy and successful. It is an enterprising approach to le, combining imagination and hard work, that got us this far.Businesspeople and workers, not ­politicians, created the UK’s success.That won’t go away just because we aren’t paying Jean-Claude Juncker’s lunch expenses any more.And once we escape Brussels’ control, we will be free to be even more ­innovative and nimble in response to all the challenges and opportunities the modern age throws at us.The people entrusted with Norway’s £billion national wealth fund can see that. And they aren’t alone.In the latest available data, the UK was Europe’s top destination for foreign investment.Unlike the blowhards and scaremongers chucking out doom and gloom for ­retweets and laughs, these are serious investors, putting their money where their mouth is and betting that our country has a bright future.I know who I’d believe.Norway fund has holdings in:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what will happenit doesn’t pass is truly appalling.If Mrs May’s deal hasn’t won a Commons vote by March , the Commons will vote on whether to proceed with No Deal.The Parliamentary arithmetic is such that No Deal will be defeated.The next day, Parliament will then vote on whether to request an extension from the EU. This vote will almost certainly pass.At this point, the UK would be in the weakest position it has ever been in this negotiation.Whether to grant an extension or not would be up to the EU and would require all  member states to agree.Any extension would almost certainly come with conditions.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already said it would have to be “justied by new choices by the British”.It would also be up to the EU to decide how long an extension to offer.If Parliament accepted the terms of the extension, then there would almost certainly be another effort by MPs to take control of the Brexit process.A cross-party group of MPs is already preparing to do this.If they succeed, Brexit would become softer still.Parliament would try to commit the UK to staying in a permanent customs union with the EU.Some MPs would even like to keep the UK in the single market as well, following EU rules on everything from financial services regulation to free movement.Others would use an extension to push for a second referendum.The only way to sidestep this scenario is for Mrs May’s deal to pass by the th.But given that it lost last time round by  votes — a record defeat for a Government bill — this is a hard ask.Mrs May’s plan for getting it through has been to get something on the backstop to reassure MPs that it won’t be permanent.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has been tasked with doing this.The key to getting the deal through is persuading the Tories’ confidence and supply partners, the DUP, to accept the deal.If they do, the Tory rebellion will reduce substantially.After all,the DUP are satisfied that the deal won’t end up splitting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK — the principal criticism of the backstop — then it is hard for any Tory to object to it on these grounds.Along with the Government chief whip, Cox met the DUP on Wednesday night.The verdict of one senior DUP source after that meeting is that the Government is “not there yet” on getting enough for them to come on board.Some leading DUP figures think the move by Cabinet ministers to try to take No Deal off the table has made it less likely that Cox can get enough to satisfy them.“It’s tricky. Barnier isn’t yielding, the Irish aren’t yielding,” complains one Cabinet minister.At the moment there is little optimism in No about being able to hold a meaningful vote next week.That means the Government will have only one chance to turn round a -vote defeat.But Brexiteer MPs should remember that things will only get worseMrs May’s deal hasn’t passed by the evening of March .THE prospects of Mrs May’s deal passing depends on what the DUP and the European Research Group, the main Brexiteer bloc in the Tory Party, make of any changes Geoffrey Cox can secure to the backstop.The ERG has now set up a  of legal eagles to examine what Cox comes back with.The signicance of this group is twofold.First, the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – a Cambridge-educated lawyer – is a member of it. This, as one former Cabinet minister tells me, shows “the symbiosis between the DUP and the ERG”.It means the DUP and the ERG are likely to take the same view of whatever Cox delivers. The second is that it provides a structure for examining any changes that Cox secures.Some in the ERG leadership were concerned that the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash – also a lawyer – was determined to rubbish whatever Cox gets.They feared that an instant verdict from him could commit the group to opposing the deal come what may.But no one should think that the other lawyers in the group will be looking to give Cox’s work an easy ride.One leading Tory Brexiteer tells me: “If they unpack the stuffing of Cox’s codpiece and find it is a vainglorious appendage, then they’ll say so.”I understand that Cox is concentrating more on a clearer exit mechanism for the backstop than a time limit.But whether this will be enough to satisfy these lawyers remains to be seen. TOM WATSON’S group of Social Democratic Labour MPs is expected to have its first meeting next week.The question of what Watson, the party’s deputy leader, is up to with this group is preoccupying Labour insiders.One option is that he could use the group to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt positions this group want him to.Labour’s electoral prospects cannot survive many more defections.If Watson regularly made clear thatCorbyn didn’t do X, Y or Z then this group might walk, he could change Labour’s approach in a host of areas.Fear of more defection is what explains why Labour is now moving towards backing a second referendum, and why Corbyn loyalist Chris Williamson has been suspended for saying the party is too apologetic about anti-Semitism.But by setting up this group, Watson also makes it easier for it to one day declare its independence from Corbyn’s leadership and stand on its own two feet as a new political party.The group will, over the coming months, work up the policies that any new party would need.IN private, Tories are eagerly speculating about the leadership contest they expect later this year.Allies of Boris Johnson had been confident that he would, eventually, secure the support of Amber Rudd.They didn’t expect the pair to run on a joint ticket.But they were hopeful that she would back himshe was knocked out in the early rounds of the contest.Securing the support of a Remainer from the One Nation wing of the party would have been a big boost to Boris’s campaign.It would have shown that – contrary to what his critics say – he COULD bring the two wings of the party together.But some of those close to him now fear that the Brexit dferences between them are too big to make such a pact possible.They worry that Rudd might now look for someone  to throw her support behind.One Boris backer tells me: “Amber is playing a very clever game.”If he had done that, Cameron would – probably – have won the referendum and would be coming towards the end of his second term as PM.In both recent negotiations with the EU, the UK has reduced its bargaining power by never properly preparing to walk away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But now the seven-year-old is able to live le to the full after boffins developed a £ plastic limb for her which works just like a normal arm.Phoebe was given a prosthetic at nine months old but it did not move and only served to help with hand and eye coordination.She later used a split hook around the age of five which still didn’tlike a real hand, but her le was changed when she was given the cutting edge new limb.The youngster, who lives with mum Julie, , dad Keith, , and brother Jacob, four, in Hazel Grove, Cheshire, said: “I really like it, all my friends think it’s so cool.“When I first put it on it was a bit weird, because it works just like my right hand, but now I’m used to it. It was really weird because I was able to hold a kne and fork for the first time ever. Now I can brush my hair and play catch with it, I love it so much.”The limb was developed for Phoebe thanks to her aunt Claire Handby, who works for accountancy firm Deloitte.In October  Claire visited a D printing event and saw an adult limb. She contacted the firm’s self-styled chief disruptor Ed Greig and they embarked on a mission to create a limb for Phoebe.Using just three measurements and software created by Charity Team UnLimbited, they were able to create a limb. The device is made with plastic and string and uses the kinetic energy from her elbow movement to make the ligaments close the fingers.Mum Julie is delighted with the limb and now wants the NHS to consider rolling out the technology so that more children can benefit.She said: “It’s just amazing to see how much confidence it has given Phoebe. She used to hide her hand, now she can’t wait to show all her friends. The great thing is D printing makes it so cheap. The NHS can’t afford to spend thousands on bionic hands for children because they are already growing.Phoebe has had nine dferent hands in two years because she is growing - but they only cost £ each because they are printed.”Phoebe has had the hands custom-designed for her and designs have included a troll theme, a Disney Frozen look and a special Man United edition for when she was a mascot at Old Trafford last month.Aunt Claire said: “To see her shake my brother’s hand with her left hand, for the first time in their lives, was priceless. It’s something our family will never forget. Phoebe has gone from being the child that is identied as a victim to the cool kid – her friends say they wish they had a hand like hers.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the accusations prove credible, the abusers access to power should be removed.Sir Ian worked with Bohemian Rhapsody director Singer on the X-Men films and had roles at the Old Vic theatre while Spacey was artistic director.Both men have since been accused of abusing others - with the Old Vic confirming they received  testimonies of alleged inappropriate behaviour by Spacey.The double Oscar winner has pleaded not guilty to groping an -year-old restaurant worker in Nantucket, US, and is being investigated by American and British police.He was also accused of making a sexual advance to actor Anthony Rapp when he was aged  in .Spacey said he did not remember the encounter, but apologised for any inappropriate drunken behaviour.Meanwhile Singer allegedly sexually assaulted four men while they were underage - but the director has since branded the report a homophobic smear piece.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fleas were visible on every part of his body.”Apart from having fleas living around his eyes and neck, the court heard that  fleas escaped from just one square inch of Fi’s skin.According to Grimsby Live, David Morris, a nurse, rescued Fi as a stray “off the street”.He said that the dog had been with them for about seven years, and he believed that he had “rescued Fi from certain death on the day I rescued him”.Admitting he was “stupid” but “not cruel”, Morris said he felt “bereftmy dog has suffered”.Morris told the court he had not taken the dog to the vets because he was worried they might discover that Fi was microchipped, and the dog would be “taken back to that awful place” where he suspected he had been cruelly treated.Susan Morris said she had bathed the animal for fleas.Hywel Davies, defending, said: “There were no signs of discomfort or suffering. They were not to know. Nothing there warrants a trip to the vet’s.”The court was told that Fi was a “happy little dog” that “didn’t seem bothered” by the flea infestation, as he “didn’t whine and didn’t scratch unduly”.Sentencing has been adjourned for court reports.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was much speculation on how Wills would plan his schedule, and whether he would even try to attend both events. Eventually, it was decided that William would skip his duties at the game, remaining at the wedding instead.  Harrys brother was the best man for the Royal Wedding, with around  guests attending the cermony. In a statement at the time, Kensington Palace said: The Dukes responsibilities as best man mean that he will not be able to attend the FA Cup. Of course, this time around, William is likely to have a much less pivotal role in the ceremony. Its not yet clear whether the prince will choose his family over his duties with the FA or whether his we, Kate, will attend with or without her husband by her side. Gabriella Windsors wedding is not going to be televised, according to theand its also unlikely that there will be a carriage procession following the ceremony.

Over the years theyve actually plumped for some interesting choices. Prince William used to call the Queen Gary , and Prince Charles is reported to refer to Meghan Markle as  Tungsten . Even younger royals, like Prince George, have got in on the action with cute aliases for Prince Charles and Camilla, who are Grandpa Wales and Gan-Gan respectively. Princess Charlotte gets the nickname treatment too, and the Duchess of Cambridge recently let slip the sweet moniker they use for her while on their visit to Northern Ireland.   During a trip to Ballymena, Kate was talking to blogger Laura-Anne, who is mum to son Bertie. While talking to Laura-Anne about her son, the Daily Star writes Kate was reported to exclaim: Oh! Hes the same age as Lottie! Well, it was either going to be that or Charlie. Thats not the only pet name the Cambridges have for their daughter. Wills and Kate also call her poppet.   The Royal family are said to opt for odd nicknames for a number of reasons. A source told the Sun : The royals are not very good at communicating with one another so this is one way around it. Nicknames are a way of taking the family tension out of things. “They can also be a rather childlike family. They love to play games and they give each other silly presents. I think its because they have to be so earnest in their public lives. Royals have always played in private.

The children - aged seven, six, four, two and one - often do not have enough food to eat and rarely have clean clothes, it is claimed. One girl has also reportedly had to have seven teeth removed because of poor dental care. The childrens plight has emerged after their concerned grandmother and auntie spoke to Grimsby Live and shared horric images from inside the home. They say the children are good as gold but their mother just does not seem to care, and would rather blame others than take responsibility for her children. And despite the worried familys attempts to intervene, the childrens grandmother says she was told by social services that the kids must be ed to their mother.  The grandmother told Grimsby Live: Something needs to be done to remove my grandchildren from that hellhole that they are living in. The place is absolutely disgusting and they are living in filth. There are piles of dirty clothes everywhere, and they never have anything clean to wear, they are never bathed or have their teeth brushed and there is no food at all for them to eat. The cupboards are either bare or full of mouldy food, although there are still bottles of cider and vodka for her boyfriend. The mouldy food also covers the floor and it worries me that one of these young kids could pick something up and eat it, because that is the sort of thing that young children do.  There are cupboards and doors hanging off their hinges, or set to one side, and the children have begun using them as climbing frames. There is no safety equipment like gates in the house to protect the kids.  There is such a mess that the drains have begun overflowing in the back garden, with waste coming up through them. As soon as you walk into the house it reeks of urine and faeces.I have spent hours upon hours in that house trying to clean it, but then I willthe next day and it will be like a bomb has gone off. The disgusting images show a table covered in crushed chocolate cereal while piles of clothes lay strewn across the floor. Pictures also show grubby carpets, littered with kids toys. In the bathroom, numerous tiles have come off the wall by the bath and the flooring appears to have been torn up. In the kitchen, there are numerous pizza takeaway boxes stacked up on top of the oven and the two waste bins are overflowing with rubbish.  Waste also appears to be coming up through blocked drains in the back garden. The children allegedly regularly miss important doctor and dental appointments, with the four-year-old already having had seven teeth removed because of poor dental hygiene, it is claimed. Its also alleged that the children are often left to their own devices, with some of the youngest forced to put themselves to bed at night in broken beds. The worried family members say the situation reached boiling point last week after the daughter reportedly left the house to see her new boyfriend.  She had left the children in the care of their biological father but did notfor more than a day, it is claimed. The grandmother says she rang social services and explained the situation, and they agreed that she could take the children to her house. However, a few days later they rang back and said that the kids must be ed to the house to be with their mother.   The auntie of the children, their mums sister, said: It is heartbreaking when you see how these children are basically left to fend for themselves whenever they are at home. The saddest thing is how the two-year-old heads off to go to bed all on their own. Nobody sits with them, nobody tucks them in, they just head off with their bottle all on their own and go to bed.  The other day when we took the kids to my mums, we searched the house for a long time trying to find the kids some clean clothes that they could wear, but there was nothing. We ended up having to wash everything ourselves or buy them new clothes.  The children also looked like they had not had a bath for weeks, and we ended up having to bathe them, and when we did we found this sticky green slime in one of the kids hair that had been there for ages. We ended up having to go and get a hair cut, because their mum isnt going to do it. One of them also told us that the other day they were forced to eat dry Coco Pops, because even though they asked their mum numerous times to get them some milk, she never bothered. The grandmother says that she is wanting to take custody of her grandchildren in order to bring them up in a nice and comfortable environment, and is willing to move from her one bedroom flat in order to do so. She says that she believes that the children would rather stay with her, because they told her that.  She said: If I could, I would take custody of these kids myself, so that we are able to bring them up in a nice and safe place. They have told me that they do not like living in that house.  For years they have asked meI can teach their mum how to bake and do nice things with them, because we do that at my house, but not hers. Something needs to be done, because my grandchildren should not be allowed to live like this. A North East Lincolnshire Council spokesperson said: We’re looking into this case as a matter of urgency.

Sales of energy drinks to under s were banned by a number retailers last year due to concerns that they contain high levels of sugar and caffiene.

Little Megan Clarkson, aged two, died in January after developing a cough in , which her mum claims doctors said was nothing more than an infection. Her devastated mum Kelly, from Kirkcaldy, Fe, says she took her daughter to see a total of six doctors and five nurses over a period of  months, the Daily Record reports. But she claims she was fobbed off by GPs for two years with no recommendation of an X-ray, despite Megans respiratory rate having increased to double the normal level.   The youngster had begun to lose weight and her chest was indrawing, which is known as subcostal recession - a sign of breathing dficulties. Kelly said Megan had a persistent cough since starting nursery at six months of age, was being sick after eating and was off solids as far back as November . After four months of being constantly told it was nothing more than an upper respiratory tract infection and that some kids cough, Kelly stopped going to her GP. In  her daughter had pain under her arm and bruising that would not go away. She told a nurse practitioner that little Megan had a chesty cough and was choking at night, but was given antibiotics which the youngster could not swallow. Kelly, who has a son Myles, aged five, said: Looking back we feel let down by Megans care when she was around eight to ten months old. Early detection of cancer is your best hope for defeating it and at an earlier stage Megan would have had a  per cent chance of survival and at the end, this had dropped to  per cent. I just think the numbers speak for themselves.   She added: Early detection could have saved her le, but the only way wed have got that isthe doctors had looked passed the viral infections and the come-back--it-gets-worse attitude. When you do come back and it is worse, you feel fobbed off. You feel let down and youre less likely to go back and try to find outtheres anything wrong with your child. Kelly was then given the first of two inhalers to help her daughter breathe and was told the youngster may have asthma, but things took a turn for the worst in December. Megan was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh after Kelly said she had to be nasty in her demands to see a doctor and not a nurse practitioner. By this time the X-ray showed a white out lung, which is often a sign of pneumonia. But Megan was diagnosed with type three Pleuropulmonary Blastoma - a rare and aggressive form of lung cancer found in children. Her windpipe had shted to her left side, which meant her condition could deteriorate quickly. Little Megan was then taken to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow where an ultrasound of her heart showed the tumour mass had grown. Her best chance of survival being an operation to remove it.  The youngster was operated on and had her whole right lung removed, but suffered a massive bleed and cardiac arrest. She died at nine minutes past midnight on January  - just three weeks after being diagnosed. But despite everything Kelly refuses to point the finger at NHS Fe, believing there has been a systemic failure that has let everyone down. Kelly said: Its not specic to any one person, its letting down the whole system which is letting down the people who work there as well. I believe that nobody is given the chance to do their jobs properly and to help children like Megan. I dont see how thats going to be dferent in the future without a massive change in the system. We need to have an investigation into the practices around how we care for children, particularly young children who cant talk for themselves and improve the level of service that were offered.  NHS Fe medical director Dr Frances Elliot said: The death of any child is a tragedy and our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this very dficult time. NHS Fe has not received any direct communication from the family. However, we would extend an offer to meet with the family to discuss the concerns they have raised.

Our children, Our Choice - Work with parents not against them. But the school says the No Outsiders programme, started by the schools assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat MBE, is about making children aware of dferent peoples lestyles.   The programme, run alongside sex and relationship education lessons, promotes LGBT equality and challenges homophobia in primary schools. Books now being read by pupils include Mommy, Mama and Me and King  King - stories about same-sex relationships and marriages. Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, previously explained how it is vital children know about families that have two mummies or two daddies. Mrs Spielman, in light of angry protests against teachings of same-sex couples, told the BBC : Its making sure [children] know just enough to know that some people prefer not to get married to somebody of the opposite sex and that sometimes there are families that have two mummies or two daddies. Its about making sure that children who do happen to realise that they themselves may not fit a conventional pattern know that theyre not bad, theyre not ill. And, at the end of the day, its something that the vast majority of faith schools, even those which clearly teach that homosexuality is not right in their faith, still manage to do in a sensitive and careful way that absolutely does fulfil the law and we report on that very regularly in our inspection reports. This is something where weve got to have sane, rational discussion to say, Are there places where its not working well enough that we can find better ways    But its proper conversation that will change it, not protests, she continued. The essence of democracy is we dont all get our way. The essence of democracy is that we accept majority decision which means there will always be things that some of us dont like.

Peter Earl, Head of Energy at comparethemarket , said: “It’s great to see Brits looking at more and more ways of going green with tracking showing that a number of themes are continuing to grow year on year.This is encouraging, but as the warmer temperatures in February might have prompted some to think, we can all to do more to do our bit.   “That’s why, for today’s Sunday Switch, we’re launching a new tarf with Pure Planet dedicated to renewable energy — providing Brits with an easy way to further reduce their carbon footprint — and are calling on all energy companies to provide green tarfs to support the UK’s commitment to the environment. “Getting a quote and checking whether the green tarf is the right one for you could take just minutes, could give you valuable savings and could enable you to do even more for the environment too.”  Heatwave The research found that  per cent — equating to over  million households — are considering switching to a green energy tarf in order to reduce their carbon footprint.

Lyndsay Davidson has a rare form of cystic fibrosis which has caused so much damage to her lungs she cant leave the house without hooking herself up to le-saving oxygen she carries in a backpack.Le expectancy for the average cystic fibrosis patient is just  but many don’t even make it that far, the Daily Record reports.Lyndsay admits the thought of dying is “always at the back of my mind” and says “I don’t really plan the future because there might not be one for me. I don’t know how much time I will have.”The -year-old is begging politicians to “hurry up” and approve the new law which would move Scotland to a system of presumed consent for organ donations.  After two-and-a-half years on the transplant list Lyndsay has had only one possible match for her tissue and blood type. This week, MSPs heard the first stage of the Human Tissue Bill, which will change the law to presume people have given consent for their organs to be used to save the lives of others unless they have stated otherwise. But it has a long way to go before it is passed, and families will still have the power to refuse consent. Lyndsay of Prestwick, Ayrshire, warned potential donors: “Evenyou are already registered, you need to deal with the family conversations.” She added: “People thinkyou are old you won’t be able to give your lungs, but I have known of cases of lungs from people in their s being transplanted into teenagers.” Lyndsay urged MSPs to back the Bill. She said: “It is the only logical step. Please hurry up.” She has bravely told her story in the hope of persuading more people to sign up as transplant donors.   Lyndsay is like any other young woman her age who likes to go out with her long-term boyfriend Sean McCracken, , and enjoy a social le. She dreams of a career and a house of her own. The young woman was within minutes of a transplant last month but unfortunately doctors decided the operation was too risky because of the condition of the donor lungs. From the day she was born, Lyndsay has had to do physiotherapy twice a day every day to remove phlegm from her lungs and help her breathe. She struggles to breathe and has to take a number of drugs.  Lyndsay learned how to play the saxophone in a bid to help her breathing but admits: “I can’t manage the fast tunes.” When she was a child playing hide and seek, her mum would just listen for her laboured breathing to find her. She could barely do sport and had long periods when she was on oxygen  hours a day. Lyndsay has to go into hospital to get intravenous antibiotics at least every three months. She did a college course in photography after school but is not well enough to take up a career, so takes pictures when she is able and sells them at craft fairs. For Lyndsay, her only real hope of living a proper le is a transplant.  On February  she got the call shed been longing for - but things didnt work out as planned. Lungs had become available and an ambulance was being sent to “blue light” her to Newcastle, the nearest transplant centre. She said: “I was about to go to bed when I got the call. My parents were out. They had gone to a concert in Glasgow and were on the train back home when I phoned to tell them. “They couldn’t speed up the train but I think they sprinted all the way home when they got off. They made it here before the ambulance arrived. By .pm we were on our way. “Mum came with me in the ambulance and dad followed in the car. He stopped to pick up Sean on the way.  She added: “But we were taken aback when we got there to discover I was the only one there. We understood there would be three or four people who would all be assessed to see who was the best match, who was most in need and who was most likely to survive it. I knew there was a possibility I might not wake up again. “When I realised I was the only one there, I was kind of numb. But I knew it still might not happen, because they can’t open the donor up until you are in the opposite theatre. “I had a wash with antibacterial soap and got gowned up. I was pretty much at the end stage when they came in and said they had looked down the lungs. Whatever they saw, they thought it was too risky to proceed.” Lyndsay and mum Nickie had arrived at the hospital around .am, but just  minutes later she knew shed be heading home again. She admits she sometimes thinks about what she is missing out on when she sees friends moving on with their lives.

And now the man has turned to the internet for advice after being weirded out by the truth.  The unnamed man, , revealed all in a post on Reddits Relationship Advice forum. He begins by saying that he and his -year-old girlfriend hadnt been together very long, but their relationship had gotten serious pretty fast and they recently moved in together.Since moving in, shes taken ownership of the laundry and doesnt ever let him help. At first he thought it was sweet that she wanted to do it all, however he now knows there was a very dferent reason for her doing the household chore. While taking out the bin, the man claims to have discovered a pair of his socks in a bag, covered in what looked like poop.   He was baffled, because the couple dont have any pets or kids, and he couldnt understand how it would have happened. But after confronting his partner, she admitted that she prefers to use socks to wipe her bum instead of toilet paper. He said: I flat out asked herit was a fetish. Its not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found out the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own.   She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobeshe is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. He added: She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After shes done with them she throws them away. She used mine because she didnt have any other socks. I hope we can laugh about this later. Im trying to find the humour in it now, but Im still weirded out.  More than , people commented on the mans post, offering advice.

Self-defence training shows a postie dropping to one knee to protect herself and using her postbag as a shield. The move comes after a string of shyhorric attacks in which rogue pets have bitten off fingers, thumbs and even a nose. The new “dog byte” computer program urges posties to look for signs that a pet is present and not to take at face value assurances that an animal is harmless. It also asks users what advice they would give to a new postman. If they make the wrong choice the rookie is bitten. Royal Mail has tried the system nearly  times since November. No attacks have occurred in more than half the areas where the units have been tested.   James Barton, Royal Mail’s online learning manager, said: “Over the years, we’ve tried to do lots of things about this. “We’ve done big public awareness campaigns.

Royal Mail has urged owners to secure pets at delivery times and fit letterbox cages or external postboxes. Mr Barton was himself attacked in  and left with permanent scarring.

From the slightly cute sounding massive penguins and elephant-sized sloths, to crocodiles so big they could feed on dinosaurs, the planet was once home to mega-size animals. Heres a list of some of the majestic creatures you may be relieved dont co-exist with us. Megalodon Sharks are intimidating enough without the thought there could be super-sized beasts out there. But meet the Megalodon. This particular species lived  million years ago and is closely related to the great white shark - but could reach up to ft long.Thats x the size of a T-Rex. They prayed on large things, probably whales, and their teeth and jaws were built for grabbing and breaking bones. Oh, and they also swam very fast. Fossils of the species have been found in Europe, Africa, America and Australia.  There was a film made about the megalodon in  called The Meg, where the shark attacks a submarine. It even manages to trap the crew at the bottom of the ocean.Pulmonoscorpius This is a giant species of scorpion, which thankfully doesnt roam the earth any more.But it did used to live a little bit closer to home than the intimidating mega-shark, with fossils found in West Lothian, Scotland. This guy was cm long and bigger than the average domestic pet cat, using its tail to catch and kill its prey. Also, it had very large eyes in comparison to its modern day counterparts, meaning it probably hunted out its victims in the daytime.   Ornimegalonyx Owls might not strike you as the most terrying creature on the planet, but think about how youd feel as a rodent running away from their super sharp claws.And now imaginethat owl was over three foot tall, weighed over lbs and could kill prey up weighing to lbs. Its said to have had very long legs in proportion to its body, which meant it could run very fast too. On the plus side it did have quite small wings.  The owls lived in Cuba and went extinct nearly , years ago. They lived off a similar diet to modern day owls - rodents, plus the occasional sloth.It pounced on prey and killed it with its powerful talons. Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi Another animal which might not seem like the most terrying but would most definitely beyou came face to face with it is a giant six-foot , lbs penguin.  These were found off the coast of antarctica and also New Zealand, living - million years ago.The regular emperor penguin is around four-foot high. And the weight of this giant, foot penguin meant it could charge and bowl over pretty much anything in its way. Sarcosuchus imperator Back to another absolutely terrying and giant animal - a massive crocodile.Literally a giant, it weighed around eight tonnes and was twice as long as a regular croc. Because of its giant size and the fact it lived  million years ago, its prey would include dinosaurs living around the same area.  Paraceratherium This massive rhino could grow up to ft tall and weighed a hefty , tonnes.Its one of the largest land mammals to have ever existed. They are described as having pillar-like legs to support all their heft - they were approximately five ft long, which is only three inches shorter than the full height of an average woman today. Despite how terrying they sound, they mainly ate leaves and shrubs.Their extinction was probably caused by climate change and a lack of food rather than one big catastrophic event that wiped them all out.  Megatherium A giant sloth the size of an elephant just roaming around planet earth - what could be more unnerving .They lived in South America and only a few land mammals exceeded their giant size. They could be up to ft tall, weighing up to four tonnes.Because it was so big, the massive sloth could feed from leaves and plants that would be out of access to other herbivores in that era. They lived mainly in groups but its been found they would sometimes live alone in caves.  These sloths had longer front legs than back legs and long claws similar to the smaller species we know today.

It’s a great way to stay fit and, by the time I’ve completed this journey, I should have raised around £, in all for a few charities, so that’s not bad.“I am loving the support I am getting from all in Dundee. It’s overwhelming how many nice people there are from Dundee to Durham, Hartlepool to Leeds, Sheffield to London.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity teams up with car dealer to provide on board learning

The decline is attributed to changes in urban planning practices.Cally Smith, , a member of the group, said: “Swts usually nest in holes on the outside of buildings and over time those holes have been filled in due to repairs.“They’re losing their habitat in the UK because people keep repairing the holes that they would nest in. They don’t re-locate very well, so it’s really important to give them somewhere to stay.“What we’re trying to do is raise awareness so people don’t fill the holes in their houses, or to be aware that there may be swts nesting there.“The natural holes are the best thing to have, butthey have been repaired then these boxes or bricks will be used to mitigate that, because that will allow us to spread out the nesting area.”The group is looking to hand out some special boxes to be attached to the side of buildings, which also act as nests.Cally hopes people will take them up on the offer.She added: “We’re working to try to make sure there is a place for them to nest during the summer, when they come back from the more tropical climate.“There’s also deforestation of their tropical habitats, to make palm oil or for logging.”She said: “We can supply external swt nest boxes to people, and we hope they would be able to put them on their houses.“Swt numbers have halved in the last  years, so this is why we’re looking to do this.”The special wooden boxes, which Cally describes as similar to a shoebox, need to be placed four-and-a-half metresoff the ground.Cally and the other group members offer advice to homeowners, and can go to houses to recommend the best course of action for the animals.It is hoped the installation of the boxes will be able to sustain more of the birds during their summer mating season. According to Cally, the number of swts in Scotland is falling more rapidly than in the rest of Great Britain.Huntly resident Cally said losing the species could upset the local eco-system and cause an overabundance of the insects that are eaten by the swts.To contact the conservation group for information on nest boxes, or to volunteer, email huntlyswtgroup@gmail"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"last call to enter accolades","story":"Time is running out to enter an environmental competition.The North East Bioersity Partnership is looking for people under the age of  who have contributed support to the natural environment within the city, Aberdeenshire and Moray.Those selected will be nominated for the North East Scotland Young Wildle Champions Awards.Entries must be submitted by Monday.Winners will be invited to a ceremony at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen on March  where they will pick up a £ prize and a trophy.Click here to find out more and download an entry form."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"pupils to showcase talents","story":"School pupils are to showcase their talents with two upcoming concerts.Children attending secondary schools in Aberdeen are coming together for the spring concerts at the Beach Ballroom.Taking place at .pm next Friday and Saturday, Friday’s show will feature the Aberdeen City Council music ensemble’s training band, youth band and guitar ensemble.Saturday’s event will include the training strings group, youth orchestra and choir.Councillor John Wheeler, education operational delivery convener, said: “The spring concerts are a marvellous  for our young musicians to display their talents.“The music service does a wonderful job of nurturing these talents and already this year we have reaped the rewards.”Tickets can be purchased online from Aberdeen Performing Arts."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/5c7652dfada8e2.02574364-e1551261344274-554x564.jpg ","title":"residents welcome plans for 500 home development on outskirts of aberdeen","story":"Residents have voiced their views on plans to build more than  new homes in their community.Cognito Oak LLP has applied to Aberdeen City Council to build the new residential development at Cloverhill, Bridge of Don, on land east of the A Ellon Road.The proposals will include at least % affordable housing, to contribute towards the demand for homes at a local and national level.Proposed community facilities include parks, inclusive play areas, a recycling centre, community meeting space, shops and cafes.Residents had the chance to offer feedback at a public consultation yesterday at St Columba’s Church. vw, px\"  Willie Mitchell, , has lived in the area for the past  years and has welcomed the proposed development.He said: “I’m really impressed by this.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14072284.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_130718SAUL_06JPG.jpg","title":"familys new hope 85000 raised","story":"NewsFamilys new hope as £, is raised to send son to America for cerebral palsy treatmentThe six-year-old will be heading to America after the huge sum of money was raised to fund his treatment.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsSaul with brothers Clay and Mylo and mum and dad, Karen and Stuart \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family’s bid to help their son walk again is set for take-off. Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14078982.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/0_Hibernian-v-Celtic-William-Hill-Scottish-Cup-Quarter-Final-Easter-Road.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

The council will splash out pound million on a new leisure centre to replace the Citadel in Ayr. There will be a new public park at the Riverside at the bottom of the town and a heritage centre. There will be a new Carrick Academy and Girvan Primary and free school meals for P kids in deprived areas. But among the cuts are  teacher posts will disappearing in schools. There will also be fewer school assistants. But there will be no compulsory redundancies. Swimming pools will open for fewer hours and casual charges for using the pool will go up. Golfers on the council-run courses are set to pay more. Other price increases faced by people include bulky uplts going up from pound to pound. Allotment holders will pay more than double - up from pound annually to pound. People will pay four per cent more for bereavement services. The budget was agreed unanimously by all councillors. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “I’m sure it will come as no surprise that one of the most dficult decisions we had to take was determining the level of council tax increase.” The council tax rise equates to p more a day for a Band D property. Councillor Campbell described the budget as “bold and ambitious.” Conservative local leader Martin Dowey said his party would not put forward an amendment.

South Ayrshire Council’s attempts to open a pound million market have been hit by more inactivity. Bosses claim they are now targeting a May opening date – almost two years later than scheduled. Officials this week admitted they had suffered “signicant delays” in their bid to reopen the former Clydesdale Bank and Suburbia Bar. An initial revival date of September  was promised when council chiefs began their transformation of the site. Last February former Ayr Renaissance boss David Bell said: David Bell said: “Work is scheduled to be complete in late spring this year, when we’ll open the ground floor as a market square to help create a busy new attraction for Ayr town centre.” But the finished article has never materialised. The ill-fated Renaissance team bought the building in March  with a view to breathing new le into the bottom end of the town. The site is where farmers sold their corn to merchants from the s to . And the vision for a new market was formulated to hark back to Ayr’s glorious status as county town. A council spokesman admitted: “There have been signicant delays to this project. However, we are committed to opening the market and events space as quickly as possible for the people of Ayr and beyond. “We have a short specialist fit-out contract to complete, which should be ready for the start of May so that the building can be used for markets and events from the summer.” Ayr councillor Martin Dowey said: “It has been one sorry excuse after another with this building and frankly the people of Ayr and beyond deserve far better.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"sleazy oap 72 who took","story":"NewsSleazy OAP, , who took pics of Ayr schoolgirls in mini-skirts told youre guilty all day longRetired architect Ross McKay was told by a sherf he \"should be able to control\" himself at his age.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsRoss Mackay was placed on the sex offenders register \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner who took pictures of schoolgirls in mini skirts will be on the sex offenders’ register for the next three years, writes Edwin Lawrence. Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March . Sherf Montgomery told McKay at the trial: “There is overwhelming evidence it was you in your car. “You’re guilty all day long.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSex crimeAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14066677.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_elr_ayp_260613babs.jpg","title":"tributes paid mr gaiety ayr","story":"NewsTributes paid to Mr Gaiety as Ayr theatre legend Bernard Cotton diesBernard Cotton was a do-it-all theatre manager in the Gaietys pomp and booked acts like Billy Connolly, Ken Dodd and Barbara Windsor.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsBernard outside his beloved Gaiety \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe man who was ‘Mr Gaiety’ in Ayr for nearly two decades has died suddenly, aged , writes Edwin Lawrence. Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

No concrete dates have been set as the event is still being finalised. However, local people and businesses are encouraged to get involved to help promote Hoggrsquos Borders legacy.Internationally, the anniversary will be celebrated in Washington DC.Enthusiasts can attend an event held in the Library of Congress where they will be talking about Hoggrsquos le and Borderrsquos traditions.Stirling University is known as the world centre of Hoggs work.And they are currently doing a project to collect all the poets work and republish it. So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still in the planning stage and the organisers are currently raising money to hold the celebrations around the Borders and in Stirling.They are currently applying to ious sources for a six-figure sum to

One of the ways is by going into local businesses to encourage them to cut down on what they use.ldquoAn idea we have also had is introducing a pint deposit scheme, similar to the one which is in place at Murrayfield.ldquoThat is something we could look at bringing to Melrose at events such as the Rugby Sevens to cut down on single use plastic.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"dalintobers dazzling daffodils","story":"Since October, come rain or shine, they have been making forays into Craigowan Woods for a morning lesson outdoors.

There is limited space for such activities within the building which can be accommodated where, enabling access to a wider range of activities and resources.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Mundellrsquos wan smiles and empty words about doing the best for Scotland as the Government he is a member of readies itself to push us off the no-deal Brexit clf, is as astonishing as it is appalling.

The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

We remain concerned that these experiences and opportunities are narrowing in schools.Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum for Scotland, said families valued the ldquohuman aspect of formal schooling.She said: ldquoCommunication is key in all human dynamics and canrsquot be replaced by digital means.ldquoSubjects like drama and art are valuable as pupils invest emotionally in them and foster transferable skills useful for their le ahead.ldquoSchools canrsquot replace the family home, but can and should be a refuge from an ever more fast paced world.Dorothy MacGinty, head of Kilgraston, an independent school for girls in Bridge of Earn, near Perth, said a decision to ban mobile phones last year was reaping rewards.She said: ldquoLessons are more interactive, concentration is better and pupils are more engaged in assemblies and particularly co-curricular activities.ldquoIt is vital that schools push activities which deliberately develop these soft skills such as team building, sport, drama and music which all develop critical thinking and self-confidence.ldquoIf schools are to properly educate young people to become the successful and effective members of society they are capable of becoming, a healthy balance of screen time and activity which nurtures soft skills is essential.Speaking to the EIS conference, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said the new curriculum would only fully deliver for pupils when schools embraced the new powers he wanted to give them.He said: ldquoI am fully behind the Curriculum for Excellence, but it will only reach its full potential and have the impact we believe it can have on the young people of Scotlandit is able to be delivered by a profession that is confident in itself and is creative about how it takes forward that approach.ldquoThat is why our education reforms are designed to put the power to change lives directly in the hands of those with the expertise and insight to target resources in the most valuable way.ldquoIt is a vision that requires the Scottish Government, local government and teachers to work together with a range of partners to drive improvement."},{"url":null,"title":"concorde-fans-celebrate-50th-birthday","story":"But from the moment Concordersquos famous drooped nose rose gracefully from the runway at Toulouse in the south of France and the first prototype took off for a -minute flight, aviation merged with national pride, technology with style and an icon was born.Today aviation fans are expected to gather at locations round the country ndash including Scotlandrsquos National Museum of Flight at East Fortune in East Lothian, where G-BOAArsquos once roaring engines rest in eternal peace ndash to celebrate  years since Concorde took to the skies.ldquoIt is our main attraction, and what brings people here, says Ian Brown, assistant curator of aviation at the East Lothian museum.ldquoVisitors come through the hangar doors and see her nose just lsquohangingrsquo in the air. Irsquove watched their jaws drop as they walk in.Born out of a joint Anglo-French project, Concordersquos maiden flight success was savoured as a moment of intense national pride.Most impressive of all was its speed. A cruising velocity of twice the speed of sound, or mph, allowed it to cover a mile in just . seconds.The epitome of cutting-edge technology of its time, Scots aviation fans can at least claim Concordersquos distinctive swept-back super-slim delta wings as their own.Designed under the leadership of Penicuik-born Sir James Hamilton, they were highly complex with a twist and drop design designed to cope with extreme speed.Hamilton left the Concorde project in , by which time the brave test pilots like fellow Scot, Ayr-born John Cochrane had pushed the craft to her limits.He was at the controls when Concorde blasted through the sound barrier for the first time in , and was on the operational flight when the it reached its highest speed of Mach . and an altitude of ,ft, and achieved the Atlantic speed record from take-off to touchdown in .Cochrane was handed overall responsibility for the engine intake systems ndash a task that involved highpressure flying in which he pushed the aircraft to its technical extremes.Many of what must have been adrenalin-fuelled, near deathdefying test flights took place over the west coast of Scotland.ldquoA lot of these flights were out of Prestwick, which was used as a training base and where pilots would take off and fly for a bit before landing, explains Brown.ldquoBecause of the sonic boom, there were lots of trials and flights, many up and down the west coast of the UK, before she received her certicates.Fty sonic boom test flights took place over three years from .People living along the coast and even in Dublin and Glasgow, were warned to be prepared for the sudden lsquobangrsquo as the aircraft sped by.Incredible as it may seem today, Concordersquos development began just  years after the Second World War had ended, and when Glasgow Corporation trams still rattled through the cityrsquos streets.Throughout her letime, British Airways Concorde fleet would go on to make just under , flights and carry more than .m passengers on the supersonic flight of their lives.Exclusive, fast and unique, it attracted a well-heeled fan base, with regular passengers including Joan Collins, Sir Paul McCartney and Diana, Princess of Wales.Travelling on Concorde became an experience in itself, with its up to  passengers speaking of the ldquokick in the back as the aircraft took off and the rising heat as it powered across the Atlantic.Jock Lowe, the longest serving Concorde pilot, said flying the aircraft was ldquolike driving a sports car compared with a normal car.While BArsquos Concorde fleet regularly ploughed a route ,ft above the ground between London and New York, short day trips from Edinburgh around the Bay of Biscay and back gave lsquoordinaryrsquo passengers the supersonic experience without the eye-watering pound, cost of a transatlantic ticket.ldquoTravel agents like Bennettrsquos in Musselburgh sold tickets, and included with the flight details was a car sticker to put in the window because there would be so many people at the airport just to see Concorde that passengers would be at risk of missing the flight.Concorde was retired from service in October , with British Airways and Air France blaming a downturn in passenger numbers and rising maintenance costs.It also came after an Air France Concorde crashed minutes following take-off from Paris in July , killing all  people on board and four on the ground.Aviation analyst John Strickland does not believe another large-scale version will be developed while passengers prioritise low fares above speed.ldquoIf you cut the time it takes to fly to Australia in half, there would be a level of interest, he said.ldquoBut what would people be willing to pay, relative to the price of such an aircraft

It isnrsquot. Itrsquos pitched at an internal audience.In particular, itrsquos pitched at those many SNP members who are suspicious of the leadershiprsquos Growth Commission, the hair-shirt economic blueprint for an independent Scotland written by former MSP turned corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson.A heresy against the  White Paper, the Commissionrsquos report recommended spending Decade One after a Yes vote driving down debt and keeping a tight grip on public spending. It also backed keeping the pound ndash at least for now.Ms Sturgeon declared herself delighted, the membership less so. Besides the whf of austerity, there was that plan to keep sterling and UK monetary policies. Former SNP MPs such as George Kerevan politely but firmly laid into it.After hosting a series of National Assemblies to hear the views of SNP members, Mr Brown will put a motion to Aprilrsquos conference backing most of the Commissionrsquos  recommendations, but with a more gung-ho line on currency.Writing for the home crowd in The National yesterday, Mr Brown said: ldquoWe will propose that it should now be party policy that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency. So far, so clear. But then the fog descends.ldquoOf course, until that can be done safely and securely, our currency would continue to be the pound sterling. It must be done at the right time, in a way that affords necessary protection for our nationrsquos economy and for peoplersquos personal finances.ldquoThe aim of an SNP government would be to complete preparations in time for the newly independent Scottish Parliament, informed by assessments and information from the Central Bank, to take a decision on establishing a new currency by the end of its first term.ldquoThis will ensure that the use of sterling is not an open-ended commitment ndash an issue raised at the National Assemblies.The language is new. But at best, the leadership has moved from agnosticism on a new currency to a highly caveated inclination. Yet something that heavily caveated isnrsquot really a belief in anything. Itrsquos a fudge. Itrsquos also a muddle.For example, Mr Brown seems to suggest evidence and economics would count, but also that Holyrood would decide to back a currency on a set timetable regardless.A politically brave idea, as it would make the following election a referendum on whether to follow through with that decision.Mr Brown also reminds me of someone daydreaming about how theyrsquoll spend their lottery millions before theyrsquove even bought a ticket. It may be enjoyable, but therersquos the small matter of winning first. It was noticeable he didnrsquot offer a timetable on actually securing independence.The audience for this mush is clear from the last line, where he says activists at the partyrsquos National Assemblies didnrsquot like the idea of an open-ended commitment to sterling.They must be a conspiratorial lot. The Growth Commission never made an open-ended commitment to sterling. It said it should be used until something  made more sense, as did the SNP Governmentrsquos Fiscal Commission before the  referendum. Both said sterling was best initially because the UK and Scottish economies were so aligned.But both were open to a new currencythe economies erged. The Commission proposed six tests on credibility, markets, debt, trade, reserves , and public appetite. Explaining the process to voters before a referendum was an ldquoabsolutely necessity, it said. Both were also clear context was all. There was no dogmatism about having or not having a new Scottish currency. It all came down to the circumstances. They definitely did not say, lsquoLetrsquos do this in the first term of an independent parliament to keep the troops happy.rsquoBut it seems National Assembly-goers live in dread of an indefinite backstop on the currency, and want to put a time limit on it, whether itrsquos rational or not. How very ERG-like.I suspect that, behind the fudge, the SNP hierarchy is keeping faith with the Growth Commission, because it sees sense in it, while talking more warmly about a new currency to molly the members.This could backfire on several fronts. The members could see straight through it and get more disgruntled. It was interesting how much scepticism there was from senior SNP figures who want a new currency yesterday. The leadership is not trusted on this. Even vague talk of a new currency could become a giant bullseye for Unionists, who would use to it attack the SNP as reckless and flaky. The party has, after all, backed the euro, the pound, and now, sort of, a third currency.It does not seem driven by long-term national interest, but by short-term party management. The Tories have their Eurosceptics to placate, the SNP their sterling-sceptics.The key thing is whether it helps the cause. But who does this idea appeal to outside the  per cent Will a mystery currency move a single No voter to Yes  Did people reject independence because the last currency offer wasnrsquot radical enough  Did they object to their wages and pensions staying in sterling  Were they crying out to take a punt on a Scottish pound Mr Brown seems to think so. ldquoI believe this approach will maximize support for an independent Scotland, he wrote yesterday.

in January of a backlog of between  and  tonnes of clinical waste and  tonnes of anatomical waste at Scottish HES sites in Dundee and Shotts.HES has previously denied claims human body parts were among waste stockpiled at its sites but Environment Agency reports said the company stored remains of NHS patients in un-refrigerated units for more than six months.Thompsons partner David Martyn, who is in charge of the legal action, said: ldquoThe former employees of HES were dismissed without notice in December last year. They have now waited three months for their former employer to do the right thing and pay them the wages, notice pay and holiday pay they are owed.ldquoSome employees are owed up to five monthsrsquo pay and have had to resort to food banks to support their families. The time has now come for us to begin formal legal proceedings to force the company to pay the money the workers are due.HES became embroiled in a clinical waste stockpiling controversy with the NHS in , during which it denied claims human body parts were among items caught up in a backlog at its sites.On Thursday afternoon around  workers staged a protest outside the premises in Shotts calling for their wages to be paid.Greig Drysdale, who worked for HES for six months, said many of his former colleagues are owed thousands of pounds.He said: ldquoPeople are annoyed because thatrsquos three months without getting a wage.

The people that worked here who built this company up have been left abandoned with money owed to them and with lots of questions still unanswered.HES have been asked for a comment.The UK Government Insolvency Service said workerswho have had a contract for more than two years are entitled to redundancy pay.It said it has received  claims for redundancy and has paid out pound, to claimants, with only one claim outstanding.A spokesman said: ldquoHealthcare Environmental Services has not put itself into insolvency so under law the workers cannot claim for wages owed, notice pay or holiday pay at this time.ldquoIf the company puts itself into an insolvency procedure then these payments could be made.Sepa said it is carrying outregular inspections of the sites.A statement posted on the HES website in January said ldquothedirectors and senior managers of HES have fought daily for the survival of the business, while owner Garry Pettigrew said he was still fighting for workers.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe have supported affected employees through our Pace initiative and will continue to monitor the situation and provide further support as required.ldquoThe company has claimed that their bank refused to release funds to pay salaries.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

She went to Caithness General Hospital in Wick in November after her waters broke when she was  weeks pregnant.It was decided she should go by ambulance to Raigmore in Inverness, over  miles away, to have her babies.But as she was near Golspie, her contractions became stronger and she was taken to the local community hospital, the Lawson Memorial, where she gave birth to a boy.A helicopter was then to take the woman to the Highland capital but was unable to land due to frost on its propellers so she made the rest of the journey by ambulance and gave birth to the second twin.Labours Rhoda Grant raised the case in parliament and claimed the air ambulance should have been called when the woman went into labour.She asked: \"It begs the question why was the air ambulance or emergency retrieval team not tasked initially to airlt the mum from Caithness \"Will the First Minister investigate this and will she make sure that the air ambulance treats situations like this as a priority \"Nicola Sturgeon promised to investigate and asked Scotlands health secretary, Jeane Freeman, to look into it.Bill Fernie, the chairman of Chat, said the case highlighted the groups concerns about mothers having to travel to Inverness to give birth.\"Fortunately, we have not had a tragedy yet and hopefully we never will ndash but this underlines the fears we have had since the changes were made to the local maternity unit. There has been no risk assessment for the people who have to travel to Raigmore to have their babies.\"There has never been a problem with care at Caithness General or Raigmore, but mothers here should get the same kind of access to treatment as they get in the cities and we used to have here. Why in an emergency cant the experts be on call to come to Wick rather than the other way round \"I hope this Scottish Government investigation comes up with some solutions to this whole problem.\"NHS Highland said an internal review will be carried out to consider the specic circumstances of this case.Saturday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Vehicle vandalised in Wick","story":"Police are appealing for information regarding damage done to a motor vehicle in Wick.The bonnet of a car parked at Argyle Square, Wick was believed to have been damaged somewhere between the hours of pm on Monday, February  and am on Tuesday, February .If anyone has any information, Police Scotland can be reached by calling  and quoting reference number: NJ .Saturday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick Francis Street Club placed in liquidation","story":"WICKS Francis Street Club has been placed in liquidation, it was confirmed on Thursday.According to provisional liquidator Iain Fraser, a partner with FRP Advisory, the decision was made following a decline in membership, rising costs and unsustainable cash-flow problems.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award.

I knew it was a process systematically designed to break people down,” he said.“I was subjected to sensory deprivation, with goggles, ear masks and shackled.

And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland olympic hero dame mary peters further honoured by the queen","story":"Dame Mary, from Northern

The First Responders received its first donation on February . Braid Valley Vintage Enthusiasts presented the Scheme with a cheque for pound, for the purchase of two defibrillators and response packs.John Crothers presented the cheque to Stephen Lamont and Alan Murray, two of the team working to get the scheme operational by early summer. Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas. This generous donation will be of great help to us in achieving our aim.”Stephen Lamont issued an appeal for local residents to ensure that their addresses were identiable.“Clear signage is vitalwe are to get to you quickly in a le threatening emergency. “Our plea is that you identy your house number or name clearly so that it can be read from the road. “ If you live up a shared drive, please talk to your neighbours and label the end of the drive with all the house numbers and ensure that each inidual house is numbered. “This will help us to help youyou are having an emergency.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"full steam ahead for carryduff gaelscoil","story":"THE committee of a new Irish-medium nursery school in Carryduff has said it is confident it will open its doors as planned despite losing out on a proposed school building.The new naíscoil is expected to open in September this year and will pave the way for an Irish-medium primary in the area in .Gaelscoil an Aodha Dhuibh faced a setback recently after a lease on the proposed nursery site fell through. However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again.

It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally.

It is a sport,\" he added.\"Ive also been surprised just at the level of disorder on display at some of the matches and we have been concerned, particularly over the last  months that there has been a rise in both disorder, that type of offensive behaviour and the levels of aggression to police officers.\"Meanwhile, earlier this week footage emerged of a group of people singing that they hoped Brendan Rodgers would be murdered by the IRA.Images emerged of Celtic supporters in a pub singing that they hoped their former manager takes \"a bullet from the IRA\".The incident reportedly took place in an Edinburgh bar.On Thursday police Scotland said they were aware of footage posted to social media. It followed Tuesdays announcement that the Carnlough man had left the managers job at Celtic Park to take over at Leicester City.Speaking at a Leicester City Press conference yesterday, Rodgers said moving to the Premier League club was a dficult decision, but one that was \"too good to turn down\".\"It wasnt easy.

The time to decide is here. Our clear position is that, over the coming days, MPs should decide to back the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal. “It delivers on the decision the country made. It hands back control of our money, laws and borders. “It gives us control over our waters, offering us the chance to revitalise our fishing sector.

Supporting it will mean we can all move on to meet the pressing and urgent challenges we all face.”Meanwhile, at Holyrood, a Scottish Government debate on the EU withdrawal negotiations is scheduled to take place on Tuesday.The senior Conservatives claimed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be making “one last attempt to wring yet more grievance out of Brexit” and boost support for Scottish independence.Mr Mundell and Mr Carlaw added: “The best way now to stop the SNP’s separatist games is to back the deal, leave the EU in a smooth and orderly fashion, so we can all get back to the real task of creating a fairer, more prosperous United Kingdom.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Stephen Gethins described it as a ‘botched deal’ The SNP’s Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins responded: “The Prime Minister’s deal is bad for Scotland and the support from the Scottish Tories is sickening – they are clearly rattled and saying anything to try and deflect from their shambolic handling of Brexit. “They have no higher ambition for Scotland than meekly accepting whatever Brexit disaster awaits the UK. Or as one of Mr Mundell’s own Cabinet colleagues put it – ‘Once you’ve hit the iceberg, you’re all on it together.’“Every single Brexit outcome will see Scotland worse off – our nation overwhelmingly rejected Brexit at the ballot box and it beggars belief that Tory MPs and MSPs could advocate backing a botched deal that would see jobs, living standards and household incomes slashed and threatens the growth of our economy.“There is a better future for Scotland, as an independent nation, and the fiasco of Brexit only serves to show how Scotland’s interests are ignored by Westminster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"loneliest dog in britain rehomed after 500 days","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The tour included a two-day tour of Derry.The arrival of the U.S. delegation attracted major press coverage in Ireland and America. The visit also coincided with the annual anti-internment rallies after which British Minister Nicholas Scott, a close associate of Margaret Thatcher, issued a public statement saying he regretted not being given the opportunity to speak to the U.S. contingent and set them straight.Martin Galvin said: \"We immediately replied that were still in the north and were willing and available to meet with the British official.\"But, Scott was immediately recalled back to London from Belfast and a statement was released that British officials did not speak to anyone affiliated with Irish Northern Aid, or who believed that IRA resistance to British rule at the time and in those circumstances was morally legitimate.\"However, Unioinist MP Martyn Smyth appeared with me on a UTV program and said our tour represented a blinkered view of the conflict because the delegation hadnt met with British officials or unionists.\"The following year, Martin Galvin, by then editor of an Irish-American newspaper in New York, organised a second tour which this time consisted of  Americans. It was again planned to coincide with an anti-interment rally on August , .Martin Galvin continued: \"On July ,  I wrote a letter from my office at the Irish People, offering the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and unionist leaders an opportunity to speak to us at a mutually agreed time and venue. It was a genuine offer made in response to both Nicholas Scotts and Rev Smyths public comments the year before.\"However, the British response to the offer to talk was to have then Home Secretary Leon Brittan issue an Exclusion Order against Martin Galvin at Cabinet level on the eve of the American delegations arrival in Ireland.\"Its been speculated that the ban was payback because I was in charge of American support for the hunger strikers in . But, a pretext was also added that months before at the rededication of the United Irishmen Roddy McCorley monument in Toome I had made a fairly commonplace remark that I was glad there were still men and women who carried on in the spirit of Roddy McCorley to be free,\" Martin Galvin said.However, the recent emergence of a previously classied Northern Ireland Officememo dated July ,  makes no reference to an exclusion order nor any concerns about allegedly inflammatory remarks in support of the IRA campaign from Galvin.The Exclusion Order against the American was however issued the next day-July , .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe NIO memo, signed by a JM Lyon, states: \"You may have seen that Martin Galvin had secured some publicity for his request to the Secretary of State and the Unionist parties for a meeting with the NORAID party when they visit Northern Ireland next month.\"I suggest the letter receive a short Private Secretary reply.\"I suggest Mr Barriemight inform Washington of this correspondence and let them know the terms of our reply when it has been sent.\"I suggest we do not ourselves issue the text to the press either here or in America, but should make it availableasked with the thought that this is a propaganda ploy at its most transparent.\"In view of the imminence of the visit, it would be helpfulcolleagues could let me have any comments, by telephone inconvenient, by close of business on  July.\"Martin Galvin said: \"Instead of intimidating or silencing the delegation the ban had the opposite reaction. Sinn Fein leaders had learned of the ban and told me it was important that I defied it because it would highlight censorship.\"I agreed to defy the ban and I was photographed in Derry beside Martin McGuinness to prove Id been in the North.\"When we went onto Belfast on August , the RUC had planned a brutal retaliation. Gerry Adams called me onto the  to speak at the anti-internment rally the RUC immediately fired plastic bullets and baton charged a peaceful crowd. They murdered Sean Downes and injured many more.\"But, like Bloody Sunday, the number of cameras, journalists and witnesses meant that British violence couldnt be covered up.\"The following year, , Galvin again defied the ban and appeared in Derry once more carrying the coffin of an IRA member.And, in August  on the th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Derry, Martin Galvin was arrested at Free Derry Corner whilst accompanied by Martin McGuinness.After being held at Strand Road RUC barracks he was shipped to a military base in England before being deported to Washington on a British military aircraft.\"It after this incident that the British Government announced that the Exclusion Order was being withdrawn. Ironically, I was told of this by Denis Donaldson who had been sent to America and who was obviously targeting me.\"Speaking of the -year-old episode, Martin Galvin told the Derry News: \"The ban against me was simply one more of the countless examples of British officials imposing petty and arrogant policies behind some noble cover story and then being surprised that anyone would refuse to bow to their edicts.\"We were trying to show Americans what British rule was like for nationalists in the six counties.\"I think its ironic that I was made aware of this British document just as I was traveling to Derry with another American delegation. When we met in the Guildhall with eight councillors and Deputy Mayor Derek Hussey, I referred to the memo and noted that the last time I brought an American delegation to the north and requested a meeting with the British and unionists I had been sent an Exclusion Order in reply.\"CAPTION: Martin Galvin being arrested by the RUC at Free Derry Corner in . The late Martin McGuinness can be seen on the fringe of the left handside of the phoptograph."},{"url":null,"title":"mobuoy toxic dump clean dependent funding says government department","story":"A government department has said that remediation works at the Mobuoy Road “toxic super dump” in Derry will not commence unless funding is secured.The comments made by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairscome ahead of a scheduled community meeting at Drumahoe Primary School on March  at which people have been encouraged to demand answers and a clean-up of the site after years of inaction.The Mobuoy Road waste site consists of two distinct parcels of land, namely the City Industrial WasteSite and the Campsie Sands and Gravelssite – situated .km east of Derry and occupying a signicant  hectares of land – the equivalent of  rugby pitches.It has been acknowledged by environmental experts that the illegal dump poses serious risks to the River Faughan, which runs alongside it, and supplies % of the city’s drinking water.Eamonn McCann has been vocal about the urgent need for a clean-up operation over the years and raised Mobuoy in his first speech at Stormont as an MLA.  He also said that people were aware of illegal activities at the site.Yesterday, Mark H. Durkan MLA described it as a “ticking time bomb” which could turn a “huge environmental crime” into an “even bigger environmental crisis”.Previous waste management activities on the CIW site include an old landfill regulated by the legacy Derry City Council.At the stakeholder meeting on November , , the estimated volume of controlled waste illegally disposed at the Mobuoy waste site was reported to be a minimum of , m.The nature of the illegal deposits includes municipal waste, construction and demolitionwaste and municipal waste mixed with CD waste.Both the CIW site and CSG site have been subject to illegal waste disposal activities, according to local council officials.Paul Hughes has been a member of the Mobuoy Road Stakeholders Forum which has been meeting at regular intervals over the past number of years.The forum is made up of local youth and community representatives, elected representatives as well as members of the River Faughan Anglers.‘Justice for Mobuoy’At recent meetings remediation options have been explored and outlined by the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency in terms of cleaning up this illegal toxic “super dump” - which is understood to be one of the biggest illegal landfills in all of Europe.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr Hughes said: “We are continuously told that that the Department is working towards cleaning up the dump. Its time to make it happen. At a recent meetingthe Councils Environment  Regeneration Committee the officer charged with heading up the clean-up said that they have been lucky with Mobuoy so far. What a statement to make.“Mobuoy Dump must be cleaned up without further delay. The floods of August  proved just how fragile the situation is.  The River Faughan remains under constant threat from pollution.“We should all be concerned about the issue.  We must all stand up for the Faughan.  I would encourage everyone to get along to this meeting and ask questions. I would suggest that everyone writes down all their questions and puts them directly to the NIEA on Wednesday th of March.”He added: “Our elected representatives have failed Mobuoy and have failed the River Faughan.  Despite a public inquiry having been unanimously agreed back in , it never ever happened.“Its time for concerned citizens to take control of this process and now is the time to demand that Mobuoy Dump be cleaned up once and for all and lessons learnt do that a disaster like this is never allowed to happen again.“It’s time to stand up for the River Faughan.  Make a point to attending this meeting, demand answers, demand a full clean up, demand a public inquiry. Its time to get Justice for Mobuoy!”‘Subject to funding’When asked what would need to be done to make the area safe and prevent any risk of contaminating the DAERA said would be dependent on funding.A spokesperson explained: “The Northern Environment Agency has agreed an integrated approach for remediating the Mobuoy illegal waste sites that takes full account of the need to protect the River Faughan.“At this stage DAERA through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, is seeking to enforce the former operators to remediate. In parallel to this, DAERA is developing a signicant business case to support remediation of the site.“The solution is not a simple one. The protection of the River Faughan needs to be managed through a remediation programme that comprises of several complementary phases in which there are a number of treatments on site within each phase of works. All elements of this programme will need to be supported by an extensive environmental monitoring programme.“At this stage, the remediation programme is subject to DAERA securing funding for the preparatory works required prior to remediation commencing on site.”Further detail will be presented by NIEA to the local community at an event on Wednesday th March at .pm in Drumahoe Primary School.Photo: Environmental Campaigners Paul Hughes  Eamonn ODonnell at the Environmental Gathering rally in Derry last October."},{"url":null,"title":"people profit accuses sinn fein touch reality welfare reforms","story":"People Before Profit has accused Sinn Féin of being out of touch with the reality of welfare reforms.People Before Profit candidate for Foyleside Shaun Harkin said Universal Credit has left people in debt and poverty, while denying thousands disability benefits.He commented: \"Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan has called for the Department of Communities to ensure welfare mitigations continue.

I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child.

No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade. They will wear the same unorm, access the same curriculum and extracurricular activities and be treated with the same care and respect that they currently receive in their respective schools.Mr Maguire added: ldquoThis is something that very few communities in Northern Ireland can avail of.

Longford settled first and leading marksman Darren Gallagher registered the first score with a free in the fourth minute, but despite a lot of possession, the home side struggled to get scores on the board.Downrsquos defensive cover was superb with Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty making a more than impressive debut at half back.He received great support from Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Castlewellanrsquos Colm Flanagan and Bryansfordrsquos Ruairi Wells as Down closed up shop.Mind you, Down also struggled early on to get scores, but all that changed in the th minute.A measured long ball in from Caolan Mooney was ruthlessly pounced upon by OrsquoHare and he finished to the net with panache.Points from Gallagherand Liam Connerton drew Longford level in the th minute, but Down responded in style and regained the initiative with unanswered points from OrsquoHare , Conor Poland and corner back Gerard Collins.Longford had a goal chance in the th minute when Darren Quinn carved out an opening for the lurking Gallagher, but Burns made am outstanding save to deny the danger man and send Down in at the break with a - to - lead.Paddy Tallyrsquos men stretched their lead to seven within one minute of the second half when another long ball in, this time from Poland, picked out OrsquoHare and he grabbed his and his sidersquos second goal.Longford got a much needed point from Connor Berry in the th minute, but minutes later Burns denied Gallagher.

Taking part in the mass were Canon Sean Rogan, who is a former school governor, family friend Fr Seamus McGinley and Diocesan priest Canon Noel Conway.Among those attending were Mr Eamonn McGrady, chairman of the schoolrsquos board of governors, and Mrs Darlingrsquos husband, Martin.Mrs Darling is leaving the school in the equally capable hands of the incoming principal, Miss Rosemary McLoughlin, who is the current vice-principal.Having worked at St Maryrsquos since , Miss McLoughlin is the perfect person to steward the school over the next few years as St Maryrsquos faces the prospect of joining the new lsquosuper schoolrsquo proposed by the CCMS for Downpatrick for .Itrsquos a challenge that Mrs Darling wishes she was around to oversee.ldquoRetiring is something thatrsquos really quite bittersweet for me because I will really miss the school and everyone here, and seeing the girls every morning, said Mrs Darling.ldquoBut of course I wonrsquot miss the administration. I actually thought of leaving last year but as we had our th anniversary I wasnrsquot going to leave before I had handled all of that.ldquoI think itrsquos nice for a principal to take over a school a little bit before the begining of an academic year.She sees the proposed new lsquosuper schoolrsquo as a great opportunity for the school and its students.ldquoI would have absolutely loved the challenge to ensure that every single child going into that school would be properly catered for and would be treated respectfully and fairly, she said.ldquoNot only our girls but that the children from the other schools would be treated equally and fairly.When Mrs Darling looks at her students, she unrelentingly sees promise and potential in each and every one and makes no apology for it.She is well-known for her high expectations for the students.ldquoI believe I have helped the children here to raise their aspirations, to hold their heads up high, be proud of who they are and realise that they are as good as anyone , that they are capable of being successful in their own right and to bring that success to their families and their communities, said Mrs Darling.ldquoOur children in this school have seen GCSE and A-Level results increase year on year. They know that I expect them to achieve. I expect them to work hard and to keep going until they get it right and until they get to where they want to be.ldquoTheir parents have been a wonderful support to me as a principal. They have been very engaged and we have travelled the same path together. We have built a very constructive partnership to support their children to be the very best they can be.ldquoItrsquos very important to me that every child coming through the door of this school know that they are valued, they are cherished and that they are provided with a first-class education, to progress and to be the best that they can be.Mrs Darling speaks highly of her teaching staff and all the staff who help make St Maryrsquos the school it is today.ldquoI was very warmly welcomed into the Downpatrick area and the parents were extremely supportive. We have a wonderful board of governors who have been very supportive in working with me and the vision I had for the school and Irsquom very fortunate to have had the staff that I had, she added.Like many other teachers, she was called into education due to being inspired by her own teachers from Newtownhamilton in Co Armagh where she was raised.ldquoI always wanted to be a teacher, recalled Mrs Darling. ldquoI think I was fortunate to have wonderful teachers as a pupil and was really inspired by many of them.

When it did so, there was more debate around NIO minister John Penrose and Labour’s shadow minister Stephen Pound’s early years in politics – with Mr Penrose recounting how he “ate a great deal of curry” in Ealing – than there was about the legislation, so uncontroversial was its nature. No Northern Ireland MP even spoke in the Commons debate.The limited Westminster debate about the Northern IrelandRegulations  is hardly a great surprise.Even contentious Northern Ireland legislation can sail through almost empty Westminster chambers with unanimous support from the few MPs or peers who turn up.And in this case the legislation was not even seen as controversial, but as a regrettable but unavoidable outworking of the inability of the DUP and Sinn Féin to agree to restore devolution in Belfast.The striking thing was the reaction in Northern Ireland.There were no demonstrations against the move, no calls for an urgent meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and not even a press release from Sinn Féin or the SDLP to register perfunctory criticism of another act of direct rule sending more power back to London.Even in the perpetually outraged and hyper-partisan world of social media the decision passed with more comment on Lord Duncan’s vocal abilities than on the substance of how the law was being changed.This is not an isolated case. For more than a year now there has been a plethora of direct rule legislation – inidual acts of direct rule rather than a simpler and more far-reaching decision to suspend devolution and give all Stormont’s powers to the secretary of state.The legislation passed last week allows Mrs Bradley to appoint the attorney general, a member of the Victims’ Commission, a member or chair of the Livestock and Meat Commission or a member, chair or vice-chair of the Housing Executive. join MPs and women impacted by Northern Irelands strict abortion laws on Westminster Bridge in London.

But theof a key policing and justice power – the appointment of a local attorney general – to London made it a potentially sensitive statutory instrument.With the agreement of Parliament, Mrs Bradley had already taken to herself the power to appoint senior police officers, members of the Probation Board, members of the Policing Board and the highly sensitive role of police ombudsman. The ability to appoint members of the Judicial Appointments Commission – the body which appoints judges – had already gone to the Lord Chancellor in London last year.It is now routine for the secretary of state to decide on Stormont’s budget and pass it by direct rule at Westminster. And next month she will use another act of direct rule to slash the subsidies being paid to RHI claimants.Cumulatively, these and other acts of direct rule mean that power is seeping from Stormont – where now even civil servants will not be taking the decisions – to London.The general indference, or grudging support, of most people – whether unionist, nationalist or other – to these moves is potentially signicant.Government and civil service sources have privately said that a reason for not implementing full fat direct rule – as happened on every other past occasion when devolution collapsed – was concern about the reaction of nationalism.There was also probably concern about the Irish Government’s reaction at a time when the Brexit negotiations were ongoing and then, since summer , the complicating factor of the DUP’s deal to keep Theresa May in power.It is still possible that a move to implement full direct rule – especiallyit was seen to allow the DUP unique influence over how Northern Ireland is run – would grab the attention of a hitherto apathetic public and could anger nationalists.But the evidence so far is that the numerous acts of direct rule to date have provoked virtually no controversy at all - even from those such as Sinn Féin who would be expected to publicly oppose them out of ideological principle, evenquietly acquiescing in what is happening.It is almost certainly the case that there is no grand plan from either the secretary of state or the prime minister to incrementally institute direct ruleStormont cannot be recovered.What she is doing is arguably not even the bare minimum to keep the most essential wheels of government turning in Northern Ireland. Mrs Bradley has, for instance, repeatedly rejected the uncontroverisal pleas of the survivors of historical institutional abuse for her to use direct rule powers to provide them with compensation.Perhaps the reason that Sinn Fein in particular, but also the SDLP, have been so quiet is that neither of them have a viable alternative to the inexorable sht of power from Stormont to London.Both parties – and the Irish Government – initially proposed using the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conferenceto replace Stormont, a sort of back-door joint authority whereby London and Dublin jointly run Northern Ireland. But the Belfast Agreement precludes the BIIGC from dealing with devolved matters, something which Simon Coveney articulated clearly last July.Since then there have been no viable alternatives put forward by Sinn Féin as to how Northern Ireland should be governedit cannot agree to share power with the DUP at Stormont.On Tuesday, Thereported that the government is likely to reintroduce direct rulethere is a no-deal Brexit. The paper said that several Irish Government sources had confirmed that Dublin is aware of the plans, “which have been suggested as an administrative necessity rather than a political move” due to the need for rapid legislative and executive decision-making in such a scenario.If that does happen, it could leave Sinn Fein in an philosophically weak position unless it can propose a realistic alternative whereby urgent decisions can be taken.try catch  TrendingMomo contacts N.I. man -

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The time to decide is here. Our clear position is that, over the coming days, MPs should decide to back the Prime Ministerrsquos Brexit deal.ldquoIt delivers on the decision the country made. It hands back control of our money, laws and borders.ldquoIt gives us control over our waters, offering us the chance to revitalise our fishing sector.

Supporting it will mean we can all move on to meet the pressing and urgent challenges we all face.Meanwhile, at Holyrood, a Scottish Government debate on the EU withdrawal negotiations is scheduled to take place on Tuesday.The senior Conservatives claimed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be making ldquoone last attempt to wring yet more grievance out of Brexit and boost support for Scottish independence.Mr Mundell and Mr Carlaw added: ldquoThe best way now to stop the SNPrsquos separatist games is to back the deal, leave the EU in a smooth and orderly fashion, so we can all get back to the real task of creating a fairer, more prosperous United Kingdom.Stephen Gethins described it as a lsquobotched dealrsquo The SNPrsquos Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins responded: ldquoThe Prime Ministerrsquos deal is bad for Scotland and the support from the Scottish Tories is sickening ndash they are clearly rattled and saying anything to try and deflect from their shambolic handling of Brexit.ldquoThey have no higher ambition for Scotland than meekly accepting whatever Brexit disaster awaits the UK.

Whilst there needs to be a greater emphasis on catching those responsible, we just cannot let the stuff lie there, it must be cleaned up.Praising environmental health staff, Cllr McAlinden explained that while it is the responsibility of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, this advice from the HSE’s advice has caused problems.“The SDLP council group has raised this issue and have met with the Council’s director and senior officials to discuss this very issue. I was astonished to learn that new advice from the Health and Safety Executive is apparently the reason why we cannot get our roads cleaned.“The official advice is to ensure that when staff or contractors are litter picking along roads there must be a set clearance area between operatives and vehicles using the road.“In its most simple terms, we could see our main roads coned off or even closed off completely just to enable litter to be cleared.”Councillor McAlinden added: “Officers across the councils are challenging this guidance and that staff involved in the work think it’s madness.”“The health and safety of our staff and contractors are vital, but this guidance is overkill.”“It could and will see litter stacked up on roadsides and will ramp up the costs of clearing it when the issue is settled. I just hope common sense prevails and that some action can be taken in the interim.”Rail crossing at Lurgan to close all weekend Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT |

As a former pupil of St Patrick’s College in Armagh, Frankie became fully involved with its past pupil society. In his youth, he played for several local teams around Lurgan. He was a member of Clan Na Gael’s  Championship team as a -year-old, later becoming a valued member with Wolf Tones in Derrymacash. Frankie joined the family business, which had become a wholesale wines and spirit company, Terence McKeown  Sons. Indeed he spent the rest of his working le helping to grow this into a highly successful company as Managing Director. It eventually grew into Rehill McKeown, based for a while in premises in Mary St, Lurgan, then to purpose-built premises in Annesborough Industrial Estate. He expanded the business into off licenses and later purchased MrErlains bakery in Belfast. The company was sold to CC in the late ’s. Frankie was highly respected in the business world. He was deemed a gentleman who was wise and generous with his time, helping clients and staff.He was also part of the local Rotary and then Probus Club. Frankie also had a passion for golf and was a member of Lurgan Golf Club since the early ’s. His proudest accolades included becoming a Captain in the early ’s and then President in early ’s.Indeed he was involved in the club until very recently.

His favourite venture was the ownership of a horse that would be called Church Place, as in the location in Lurgan. Frankie would regularly attend Fairyhouse, the Maze and many other Irish venues. In a tribute, Frankie’s brother Donagh said: “When you know someone who has been part of your le for all of your le, you have many memories and good times to recall. “From childhood Frankie was around, and perhaps because of the age dference, could easily and often was seen as my father. Indeed, from the age of  when my father died, he most definitely indirectly inherited the role. He was always caring, sometimes a little stern, though for the best reason, to instill a little discipline in a young boy’s le, only with a word, I should quickly add.“It was his love for sport that we shared a joint passion, that began with a ‘kick around” in Silverwood. Always the competitive type, he occasionally let this young boy win. “When he and Bridie got married, the two would temporarily adopt myself and younger sister Aideen as their own, before having their own children. By then I became a useful babysitter from time to time. “Their door was always open and we were always welcome for family occasions. Boxing Day night was always a special time for wider family get togethers with the extended family.“It’s taken me a couple of days to be able to write my thoughts about Frankie’s passing. It will take me quite a few more to come to terms with it, even though I’ve known for a while that these days were coming. My family and friends will have many stories to tell, all tinged with personal sadness, though all with a common vein of how much fun he could be, how generous he was, how he truly cared for all, not just us, his own family.“A few years ago, I had the chance to make a short video for Frankie’s th birthday. I had a chance to make a few jokes, tell a few stories of his success in business and sport, and tell of his love of sport. Best of all though was to express something that I don’t think I really did over the previous  odd years I had known him. I said “Frankie,I never told you before, I’ll tell you now. I love you”Mr McKeown passed away peacefully at his home at Kiln Lane, Silverwood, Lurgan on February , .he was the beloved husband of Bridie and loving father of Mary , Anne , and Mel, father-in-law to Kevin, Eamonn and Geraldine, a cherished grandfather of Bronagh, Niamh, Fergal, Kate, Orla, and Grainne, dear brother of Maire, Patricia, Terence , Michael, Gerald, Diarmuid, Donagh, Aideen and the late Jim and Jackie.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
