Motoring groups welcomed the possibility of a 60mph limit.Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘Few things irritate motorists more than roadworks when there’s no sign of activity, or are as frustrating as seeing that the road ahead is clear but to be stuck at 50 miles per hour.‘Motorists might well ask whether every effort has been made to get road improvement schemes accelerated to take advantage of lockdown traffic volumes, and whether schemes are being managed in a way that minimises disruption.’Nicholas Lyes, head of roads policy at the RAC, added: ‘Drivers need to prepare themselves for many years of roadworks ahead.‘When it comes to new stretches of smart motorway, they can only hope that all the years of works and reduced speed limits are worth it in terms of increased capacity. Worryingly though, drivers tell us they have serious concerns about how safe these motorways are.’A Highways England spokesman said: ‘We understand people get frustrated with roadworks.‘That is why we have been carrying out these further trials to look at where we can increase the speed limit to 60mph in different types of roadworks and in different ways – such as 247, or when there is less activity on site, or on the side of the road furthest from road workers.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Baby boy born lockdown 23 weeks weighing just 1lb set home","story":"Share this articleLockdown baby boy born seven inches long at 23 weeks set to go home after winning his battle for life"},{"url":null,"title":"Mortgage holidays taken one six homeowners lockdown","story":"Share this article Originally intended to offer homeowners a three-month break from repayments, the Government scheme was extended a further three months in late May. Eric Leenders, of UK Finance, told The Telegraph: \u0027Lenders understand that many households will continue to see their finances squeezed as the pandemic continues, and we are working hard to ensure everyone gets the support suited to their needs.\u0027The industry has a clear plan to help homeowners get through these tough times.\u0027While it is best for customers to restart their payments if they can, where this is not possible lenders are keen to help, whatever a customer\u0027s financial situation.\u0027       People who have contracted the virus or have seen their income fall because of its economic impact are eligible for a mortgage break.Many who initially applied in March are coming to the end of their three-month break and banks are encouraging customers to resume payments if possible.But borrowers in the most financial difficulty can extend their repayment break for a further three months.There is also a deadline of October 31 for applying for an initial repayment break.UK Finance also said banks have offered 962,000 credit card payment deferrals and 689,000 breaks to personal loan customers during the pandemic.Almost two million homeowners take mortgage holidays"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e744fa7635864e35089522752b98a99c4fa17d09/93_0_3407_2045/master/3407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb977ceed2ff7ba953b8b66097466b7","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests, the return of football, and the impact of Covid-19 – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dbd1be359c5fc6bf9343236a2f1403608ff8e9/0_28_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d378f6df2521e2fc83c5806c860f8295","title":"meet the makers the woodwork of takahashi mcgil in pictures","story":"Takahashi McGil is run by husband-and-wife team Mark McGilvray and Kaori Takahashi.

Though many businesses were relieved to welcome customers back after months of financial uncertainty, some shop workers were concerned that the risks posed by coronavirus were still too high. spoke to workers at non-essential retailers about their experience of reopening.“We’re dealing with cash, people’s goods and phones. I don’t know if that person is ill, or who they’re mingling with before they come into contact with us. I’m trying to carry on as normal but it makes you paranoid,” said James, who works at a pawnbroker in the north-west. “I’m anxious about passing it on to family members who are high risk.”James said some of his customers don’t believe that the risks posed by coronavirus are real, with some even claiming it is a theory, and subsequently refusing to follow physical distancing guidelines. He does not feel his company has done enough to safeguard him from this.“The company have put profits over anything else. I feel like more could have been done in regards to, well, everything really. They’re talking about making money, and not asking if people are well,” he said.Despite this, he feels he has no choice but to work.“I’m in the north-west, where the R rate isn’t very far below 1, so I think it’s a bit too early, I’d like to see that lower first. It makes me apprehensive, but I’ve got a mortgage and bills to pay, so if my employer says come in, I’ll be there.”Heidi Schramli spent lockdown redecorating her shop with her daughter Wren, and had high hopes for a flurry of customers on reopening.“Locals who were passing by while we painted the shop were asking about opening, so we had an expectation of a queue outside. But when we opened the door, nobody was waiting. The first person who came through the door was asking for a parking disc,” she said. “We wanted there to be fireworks, but we felt so deflated.”Despite their disappointment, Heidi said she felt immense relief on reopening the shop, describing it as “like taking the lid off a pressure cooker”, with all worries about reopening under lockdown restrictions disappearing instantaneously.The approach of customers to coronavirus measures has been very different, with some wearing full PPE and others picking up lots of items as they browse.“It’s most definitely been a positive experience,” she said. “It’s been a relief that although we’re still very quiet, people are still appreciative of what we do.”Abigail, 24, who returned to work on Monday, said she has been surprised at the frustration she feels towards her customers.“We ought to be glad to see them, but instead I feel that they are essentially putting us at risk for items they can live without, or order online. It’s hard not to show anger, but people are treating it as an outing. For them it’s just one interaction, but it means we’re interacting with a hundred people a day,” she said. “We must be in work and at risk, or else risk our jobs.”While Abigail said she doesn’t feel it’s too early to open, she described the precautions as “surface level”, and said she’s conscious of putting her 70-year-old parents, who she lives with, at risk.According to Abigail, few of her customers are rigidly following the physical distancing measures in the shop, and this has got worse since the start of the week.“At the beginning everyone was being super careful, but now people’s awareness has gone. I think people have given up a bit. One guy stood back waiting carefully, and he stood out because everyone else was quite complacent.“A lot of customers just think it’s about themselves and how safe they are, not the workers.”“It’s so important for us to reopen, both in terms of income, and in staying a community hub,” said Tom, who runs a record shop in Stroud with his business partner, Sean Roe. “It’s been really positive. Record shops are very emotive things, and it’s great for people to come back to them.”Berry and Roe have redecorated during the lockdown, and have put screening around the counter. They also ask customers to sanitise their hands on entry and exit to enable them to browse the records safely, and are currently allowing only one household group into the shop at a time.“It’s definitely been worth all the work. We’ve done the best we can to give ourselves the best chance,” Berry said.Phoebe* works in a kitchen showroom in Wales, and returned to work a week ahead of other shops reopening. She said that in less than two weeks, the coronavirus measures at work have relaxed significantly.“We began by being very strict and diligent about wiping down surfaces, using our own stationery equipment and only making drinks for ourselves. However, this is relaxing on an hourly basis,” she said. “We’re already retuning to our old ways of making rounds of tea and sharing desks.”Customers in Phoebe’s showroom have mainly appeared relaxed about the risks, with very few avoiding touching surfaces or wearing PPE.“We offer to use masks with customers, but nine out of 10 say no. Because of the nature of our work, most customers have already had tradesmen and builders in their home throughout lockdown, so they’re a bit more relaxed,” she said.“It would be silly to say I wasn’t worried about the virus it would only take one customer to spread the infection. But I’ve got to get on with my job.”* name changed at interviewee’s request"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30776cb7bd5b4df490bef2b7afe5af85b6815fa/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7b2c090d046df9124de44c5e48deca04","title":"agents save rare cactus texas smugglers","story":"Special agents in America have busted a smuggling ring on the US-Mexico border, but their haul is not drugs or the immigrants that President Donald Trump rails against with his “big beautiful wall”.These smugglers were trafficking something all together less high profile – so-called “living rock cactus” that grows uniquely on the arid plains of Big Bend national park in Texas.“They’re not your typical cacti. They have no spikes at all, they’re the teddy bear of cacti – soft and plushy,” said botanist Karen Little, who specialises in conservation.The plants (sp. Ariocarpus fissuratus) take decades to grow to maturity, and they’ve historically been vulnerable in the wild because feral hogs eat their roots. But now they have a more dangerous predator. “The bigger threat now is from people,” Little said.The plant’s rarity has made it highly sought after in Europe and Asia and attracted organised crime, said Phillip Land, the special agent in charge of the US Fish and Wildlife Service that presides over the Big Bend’s 1,250 square miles of rocky desert.The raid is a coup for Land and his cactus cops – they seized around 4,000 of the rare plants. But it seems nothing when compared with the tens of thousands of cacti that get ripped from the ground every year.The plant’s purported hallucinatory qualities make it valuable, Land said, but demand is also strong from hobbyists and horticulturalists who collect and show off these plants.“These people are threatening the species with extinction and killing the local ecosystem,” he said.With a huge area to patrol, taking on the cactus smugglers is not easy, but John F Bash, Texas US Attorney general, isn’t holding back. “When you mess with protected Texas cacti, you’re messing with Texas,” Bash said in a statement after the latest arrests.Land said his team at the US Fish and Wildlife Service is honing its cactus-poacher catching skills. If agents get a tip-off about suspicious activity, they go undercover, posing as tourists, to get as close as possible to the smugglers – sometimes putting tracking devices on their vehicles. But the gangs are tech-savvy too, often knowing the precise GPS location of the cacti they want to dig up.Some will even buy up chunks of terrain where they know the cacti grow, Land said. Poachers damage land that’s been untouched for hundreds of years, digging up entire “colonies” of cacti.They then harvest the plant and sell it on the Internet, packing it into boxes that dodge customs by pretending to be toys.The cacti are an unlikely luxury item, Little says, because for most of the year they’re not much to look at. “They’re squat and grey and seem lost in the green limestone of the landscape,” she says.They don’t grow upwards like the giant saguaros straight out of a John Wayne movie. “You’d barely even notice these cacti until you walked right up to them,” she said.“But then, in the autumn, they bloom with the most incredibly beautiful pink flowers. It’s their ugly duckling beauty that makes them even more desirable.”Over the years Little has watched as the population of these cacti disappear from the landscape of the Chihuahuan desert. The living rock cactus is not alone. There are 1,480 species of cacti but almost a third are now threatened, Little said. In part it’s the loss of their natural habitat to humans, but more and more it’s the black market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5961c465e25dbe54c73635a4429bebecf26d3280/0_0_5056_3371/master/5056.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a40fdf03007697a179c1af6c06ba6809 1400w","title":"eliza scanlen little women australian interview","story":"After acclaimed performances in Sharp Objects and Little Women, the Australian actor has quickly found herself one of Hollywood’s most in-demand young starsBy the age of 20, Eliza Scanlen had already played a full American anthology of roles, from dark and depraved (Amy Adams’s rollerskating, psychopathic kid sister on HBO’s Sharp Objects), to sinister (Mayella, who falsely accuses a black man of rape, in Aaron Sorkin’s Broadway staging of To Kill A Mockingbird) to literary heroine (Beth, the docile yet dogged, sickly sister in Greta Gerwig’s Little Women).And yet the Australian actor, now 21, who started out playing a stalker on Home and Away, hadn’t played the staple of rising star roles: a character who’s fallen in love.“That’s obviously something that every actor wants to do,” Scanlen tells me by phone from her home in Sydney. But, in keeping with a burgeoning career already distinguished for its challenging, ferocious roles, such romance came with an edge. Enter Babyteeth, an Australian film from director Shannon Murphy, in which Scanlen plays Milla, a terminally ill teen who falls for Moses (Toby Wallace), a restless, rat-tailed, 23-year-old vagabond she meets at a train station.Since her breakout role in Sharp Objects just two summers ago, Scanlen has rapidly built a résumé of rangy, captivating performances. Her acting often teeters delicately between unhinged and deeply grounded, able to strike a tricky balance between poles – as Milla, a reverent, unpredictable teen staring down a bitter diagnosis, for example, or as Amma Crellin in Sharp Objects, the beguiling, rollerskating (spoiler alert) killer at turns sweet, saucy and terrifying.On screen, Scanlen is unafraid to hold the center against such commanding actors as Sharp Objects’ Adams and Patricia Clarkson, Little Women’s Laura Dern.That fearlessness contrasts with how she describes the first year of her Hollywood career. “I think before I did Little Women, I was still quite afraid – I didn’t want to take up space,” she says. Scanlen booked Sharp Objects, with an audition Adams said “floored” director Jean-Marc Vallee, just weeks after graduating high school in Sydney and, at 18, moved to Los Angeles. The high-octane six months of filming and then promoting the series, far from her family and isolated in a new country, was “an incredibly scary experience for me”, Scanlen says. Her role as Amma was “emotionally turbulent, and I just didn’t really know what to do with that experience, because I didn’t know anyone my age who had that experience. There was no one to talk to about it.”Given the still rampant gender inequity and underrepresentation of female directors, Scanlen’s Hollywood career has been remarkably full of projects led by women — Sharp Objects, based on Gillian Flynn’s novel and created by Marti Noxon, Gerwig’s Little Women, and now Murphy’s Babyteeth. It’s unusual, Scanlen says, but still, she feels “lucky to have been thrust into the industry at a time like this, where women are being given the autonomy that they’ve always deserved and what the industry has needed for so long.”To observe so many women in creative roles – writers, producers, directors, lead actors – has “imbued in me a confidence, a sense that I should be here, and that I deserve to be here. And if I want to try another creative role in the industry, then I can do it and there is nothing holding me back.”Working with Gerwig and Murphy in particular inspired her to plunge ahead with last year’s Mukbang, a short film she wrote, directed and casted with friends, on a teenage girl’s wire-crossing, world-opening foray into the niche internet corner of Korean “mukbang” videos in which creators eat large quantities of food on webcams.It’s also bolstered the confidence to call out double standards in December 2019, while promoting Little Women, Scanlen declared to the Independent that she was “tired of making excuses for young male actors by saying that they’re just boys and they’ll get over it. The ‘boys will be boys’ thing, I think that’s really the crux of it. Everyone should know what it means to be professional.”She laughs at my mention of the comments now, having not expected them to generate a headline, but stood by them. The different standards of professionalism is, she says, something she’s experienced on sets. “I think women in key creative roles – and I guess it’s because they haven’t had that opportunity at their fingertips their whole lives, it hasn’t always been available to them – they are more aware of the responsibility that it holds.”Men have been in said positions for longer, “and it comes with a complacency and just maybe a self-righteousness I really despise”. There are “a lot of men I’ve worked with that are great”, she notes, “but it’s sad that it only takes a few to be angry about it”.In moments such as these and the film industry at large, Scanlen relies less on direct advice from her veteran co-workers than a model of how to conduct a career. Working with such veteran actors as Clarkson, Adams and Ronan instilled in her “a sense of confidence and ability to tackle situations like that when they come”, she says. Ronan, in particular, “takes up space in a way that is not overbearing – it’s really inclusive”.Scanlen will next appear in another twisted role, alongside Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson in gothic thriller The Devil All The Time, to premiere on Netflix at a yet unannounced date, and later in M Night Shyamalan’s latest, still-untitled project for Universal. Beyond that, Scanlen says she’s currently “sick of seeing the female plot device that people like to say is the heart of the film, but most definitely is not”, and instead on the lookout for the mundane, frenetic, idiosyncratic.“I want to see more of female characters identifying less with the struggle of the patriarchy and more just normalizing confident, empowered women,” she says, “rather than having the patriarchy or gender roles or the limitations or restrictions that have been placed on women defining the story.”Bringing more women to the lead of creative projects, both in front of and behind the camera, is “an important movement within our industry”, she added, “but I’m looking forward to the day that women can lead a film or a TV show and for that to not be the selling point.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629949db692d83d6a0b11be4d50a62c4017ef637/0_2297_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=119675d5e42344a9d30320abb194320d","title":"holiday at home yotam ottolenghi summer meze recipes greek burnt courgette yellow split pea puree spanakopita cigars","story":"All the fun of the Greek table at home: chargrilled herby courgettes, a split pea dip with caper salsa, and little spinach and feta rolls (edible Jenga optional)Most summers, I spend a couple of weeks on a Greek island with family and friends. After a day on the beach, the holiday routine calls for everyone to chip in to get the long evening going. There is shopping to be done and plenty of cooking there are cocktails to make and a table to set and there are kids to look after before we can all, finally, relax. This year, however, I expect the group to be smaller, the evenings shorter and the sun not to shine quite as brightly, and I imagine I will be reliving my Greek summers remotely, by infusing olive oil with plenty of garlic and oregano, by stuffing filo with greens and by covering the table with sun-conceived meze.Here, I’ve applied the same technique used on aubergines when making baba ganoush to courgettes. It gives them a mellow smokiness and that distinctive flavour of the grill. If you can’t get fresh oregano, use thyme instead. You will be have some of the aromatic oil left over – keep it in a sealed jar and use it for dressing salads or roast vegetables. Serve with bread.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 2-4, as part of a meze spread6 courgettes (1.4kg)120ml olive oil1 lemon – zest peeled off in 6 wide strips, then juiced to get 1 tbsp5 oregano sprigs3 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1 tinned or jarred anchovy, drained and chopped (optional)Salt15g pine nuts, toasted1 tbsp dill leavesTurn the grill to its highest setting. Put the courgettes on an oven tray lined with baking paper, put on the top shelf of the oven closest to the grill, and cook for 45 minutes, carefully turning them once halfway through. The courgettes will look completely burned and blistered on the outside by the end, but that’s fine. Remove from the oven and leave to cool down slightly.While the courgettes are cooking, put the oil in a small saucepan on the lowest heat. Add the strips of lemon zest, oregano, garlic and anchovy, if using, and cook gently for about 20 minutes, until the garlic has turned golden but not crisp. Turn off the heat and strain, keeping the oil and aromatics separate.When the courgettes are cool enough to handle, cut a long slit through the skin of each one from top to bottom. Use a spoon to scrape out the flesh, then transfer to a colander placed over a bowl discard the skins. Stir half a teaspoon of salt into the courgette pulp and leave for 15 minutes to drain.To serve, spread the courgette over a serving plate and sprinkle the pine nuts on top. Drizzle with the lemon juice, then arrange the reserved garlic slices, lemon zest and a couple of oregano sprigs on top. Spoon over three tablespoons of the aromatic oil and finish with a sprinkle of dill.This is a take on fava, a Greek meze of yellow split peas topped with capers and red onion. It’s fantastic as a dip, with plenty of bread and heaps of good olive oil, but I also like it as a warm side for grilled fish or roast meat.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 30 minServes 6 as a dip, or 4 as a side\u0026nbsp3 tbsp unsalted butter\u0026nbsp3 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, peeled and finely choppedSalt180g yellow split peas, rinsed well and drained½ tsp ground turmericFor the caper salsa2 tbsp capers, roughly chopped2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped2 thin lemon slices, pips removed and finely chopped, flesh, rind and all2 tbsp olive oilPut the butter, two tablespoons of oil, the onions and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt in a large saute pan for which you have a lid. Turn on the heat to medium, and cook, stirring often, for 16-18 minutes, until soft and deep golden. Transfer half the onions, along with most of the oil and melted butter, to a small bowl and set aside.Put the split peas, turmeric, 1.2 litres water and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt in the pan with the remaining onion and bring to a simmer on a medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes, then cover with the lid and cook for 35-40 minutes more, or until the split peas are very soft and most of the liquid has evaporated.Meanwhile, mix all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl.While the peas are still warm, put them in a blender or food processor with any remaining cooking water, add the last tablespoon of oil and blitz smooth.Spoon on to a plate, and make a crater in the middle.

Fold gently to combine, then set aside.Working one filo sheet at a time, and keeping the remaining sheets under a damp tea towel so they don’t dry out, cut each sheet lengthways into three strips, around 8cm wide x 35cm long. With the narrow side facing you, brush the exposed side of each strip with butter, then fold each strip in half by bringing the two narrow ends together, leaving you with 8cm x 17cm rectangles.Brush the exposed side with butter again and, with the narrow end facing you, spoon about 25g-30g of the spinach mix along the bottom edge, keeping a few millimetres of pastry exposed around the edges. Gently roll the pastry upwards, encasing the filling inside a cigar-shaped parcel (don’t worry about encasing the exposed ends). This should make 24 cigars, about 8cm long x 3-4cm thick.Arrange the cigars seam side down on two oven trays lined with baking paper, brush the tops with more melted butter, and bake for 22 minutes, or until browned all over.Remove from the oven and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes before serving warm or at room temperature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f487a81068d1c0bb55b57b32b12a837fd8f6311c/0_71_2045_1227/master/2045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca358008136b6e29e2432643248d5fc5","title":"watford leicester premier league match report","story":"The celebrations were intense, even in a deserted stadium. Watford were minutes away from a costly defeat after Ben Chilwell had given Leicester the lead with a stunning goal, but they refused to give in. They were into stoppage time when Christian Kabasele knocked on a corner and Craig Dawson swivelled brilliantly before hooking a volley past Kasper Schmeichel in the Leicester goal, rescuing a draw for Watford just when all looked lost.Relief pouring out of them, Nigel Pearson and his coaching staff were all off the bench to hail the centre-half’s acrobatic equaliser. It could be a precious moment in Watford’s survival bid, even though a draw keeps them firmly in the relegation mire, and it was hard to argue that they did not deserve a point after competing well in their first game back. Leicester, who lie eight points above Manchester United in fifth place, had paid for one lapse of concentration and have more to do if they are to secure Champions League qualification.Leicester did not need anyone to tell them to be wary of a Pearson side scrapping to stay in the ision. Five years have passed since he defied the odds by saving Leicester from relegation and there have been glimpses of his ability to inspire an improbable escape act since pitching up at Vicarage Road in November, not least when Watford pulled off the most surprising result of the season just before lockdown, ending Liverpool’s unbeaten run in stunning style.Ismaïla Sarr was the star on that February evening, tearing Liverpool’s defence apart with his speed and skill, and the winger was Watford’s most dangerous player in their first game back. The 22-year-old spread unease in the Leicester back four whenever he charged down the right and was entitled to ask why none of his teammates were able to seize on any of his inviting crosses during a tight first half, though anyone searching for the answer was able to find clues in Pearson’s constant shouts of “Shape” from the touchline.The margins are fine at the bottom and Watford, with Troy Deeney on his own up front, were determined not to give anything away. They sat deep from the start, allowed Leicester the ball and worked to ensure there was no space for Jamie Vardy to race in behind. It was pragmatic but necessary from Watford, who might have been carved open had they given James Maddison and Youri Tielemans the space to spring Vardy clear, and it was hard to remember Ben Foster making a save of note before the interval.Vardy’s only clear opening, a vicious effort that swerved narrowly wide in the 16th minute, stemmed from a rare error from Kabasele. Chilwell was another threat whenever he burst forward from left-back and there were shooting chances for Maddison and Wilfried Ndidi from the edge of the area. Yet Leicester were not quite at their sharpest in the final third and the best chance of the half fell to Watford, who could have snatched the lead when a risky touch from Ndidi allowed Abdoulaye Doucouré to test Kasper Schmeichel.Doucouré had already slashed over after receiving the ball just inside Leicester’s area and Schmeichel was called upon again at the start of the second half, racing from his line to deny Sarr. Watford were starting to show more ambition and they went close again when Deeney planted a header narrowly wide.You sensed that Watford needed to score during that flurry. Rodgers shook his side up by bringing on Demarai Gray for the disappointing Harvey Barnes, while the introduction of Hamza Choudhury allowed Leicester to reassert themselves in midfield. The mood changed and Watford escaped when Marc Albrighton cracked a fierce shot against the woodwork. Moments later Maddison saw a low drive pushed away by Foster.Leicester were pushing hard and they took the lead when Chiwell, showing why Chelsea want him, popped up on the left before finding the far corner with a rising drive in the 90th minute. It was a special goal and it should have been enough. Dawson had other ideas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bf556dde327d58eb0a922642cb4761aa036602c/0_218_4541_2727/master/4541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94c7546cc4217b83645b152cdeca8479","title":"brighton v arsenal premier league live","story":"33 min “Hi Rob,” says Robin Burchfield. “You said, ‘Trossard plays a nice give-and-go with Propper, and then, from a very tight angle, volleys the ball in the direction of Chichester’. Unless a tremendous amount of spin was applied which will change the direction of the ball in mid-air, I would say that it is in fact heading in an Eastbourne direction instead.”31 min: Chance for Arsenal! Saka’s low cross from the left takes a deflection and bounces up towards Lacazette, who improvises nicely to flick a header towards goal. Ryan es smartly to his left to make an excellent save.30 min Burn is booked for a poor tackle on Pepe.28 min Propper drives a pass straight out of play. As you’d expect, Brighton look very rusty in possession.26 min Trossard plays a nice give-and-go with Propper, and then, from a very tight angle, volleys the ball into Chichester High Street.25 min Mooy twists Ceballos one way and then the other to win a corner, prompting some not entirely appropriate oohs from the fake fans. Gross’s corner is a poor one.23 min It’s time for the drinks break.20 min Maupay runs at Holding and drives a low cross-shot that is well held by the ing Leno.18 min Arsenal still look the better side in possession. Saka moves into the area and tries to zip past Webster, who stretches to make a clean challenge.16 min “Will Arsenal be playing every day from now on?” says Ian Copestake. “Nice of them to just get on with it rather than moaning about fixture pile-ups as others might have of wont to be (so to say).”I’ll give you a pile-up, mate.14 min Brighton apply a bit of pressure through a series of set-pieces. Arsenal defend solidly though, and that’s that.11 min “Hi Rob,” says Tom McPeterson. “Looks like it could be a cagey one today, but if it doesn’t end in a draw then I can see one of these teams winning this.”You’ll look very silly when the match is abandoned after half an hour due to the apocalypse.10 min Brighton are hanging on. Lacazette’s close-range shot is brilliantly blocked by Dunk, who threw himself at the ball like John Terry and stopped it with his bum.8 min: Saka hits the bar! What a superb effort. He picked up a loose ball 25 yards from goal, moved infield and whipped a right-footed shot that beat Ryan and clattered off the bar. He looks a serious player, this kid, a potential superstar.7 min It’s been a good start from Arsenal, who look sharper than Brighton. That’s probably to be expected, given they’ve already played.5 min A dreadful pass from Propper goes straight to Aubameyang, who moves to the edge of the D and slashes a rising drive just wide with his left foot.3 min “If Saka is going to lay as one of a central three, des it not make more sense to put him on the left, rather than in the midfield monsterdestroyer ogre role in the middle?” says Charles Antaki. “He’s only a little chap.”Yep, that’s where he’s playing, wth Ceballos to the right and Guendouzi in what is now known as the ogre role.1 min Bukayo Saka is playing in midfield for Arsenal in a 4-3-3 formation. And Arsenal almost score after 33 seconds when Aubameyang’s close-range scissor kick is crucially blocked.1 min Peep peep! Arsenal, in red, kick off from right to left. Brighton are wearing the usual blue and white stripes.It’s a lovely afternoon in Falmer, warm but not sweltering. It’s almost time for some more football action.“Quite an odd line-up for Arsenal, if they are playing 4-2-3-1, with three wingers on the team sheet,” says Marty Bull. “Do you think they will play Pepe in the middle, or 5 at the back with wing-backs?”I think they’ll play 4-2-3-1 with Pepe in the middle, but that’s just a guess. I’m no tactics tsar.It has finished Watford 1-1 Leicester in the lunchtime game. Ben Chilwell gave Leicester the lead with a screamer in the 90th minute Craig Dawson equalised in injury time with a spectacular overhead kick.“Afternoon Rob,” says Geoff Wignall. “I can’t help thinking that Brighton (and Hove, as I’ve lived in both) could be the team punished by David Luiz’s absence.” It’s Saturday, it’s 3pm and it’s live? Bob Lord will be spinning in his grave. This match between Brighton and Arsenal - and the one running simultaneously between West Brom and Birmingham in the Championship - is the first English league game to kick off at 3pm on Saturday and be shown on television in the UK. To some it’s sacrilege, to others a logical compromise. I’ll level with you: I can see both sides!The match itself may also sit on the fence. Brighton and Arsenal are among the Premier League’s draw specialists, with 24 between them this season. Brighton are in 15th, two points above the relegation places. Since their 2-1 victory at Arsenal in early December, they have won only one out of 14 league games, with eight draws in that time.Brighton were only a point behind Arsenal after that win in December. Now they are 11 points apart. Arsenal’s form picked up after Christmas, and they were unbeaten in the league in 2020 before David Luiz’s Chaplinesque display at the Etihad on Wednesday. A Champions League place is not beyond the realms, but the Europa League is a more realistic target. Both teams could really do with a win today, though that hasn’t stopped them drawing in the past. Kick off Don’t play silly buggers, you know full well when the kick off is.

Ref right to give nothing.Some lovely football from Bellingham allows him to create space on the edge of the box, then lay it off to Hogan who earns a corner. I have not seen much of Bellingham live, so this is pretty exciting and he looks pretty ruddy good so far. A big goal at the bottom as Pearce bundles the ball home from a corner against relegation rivals Hull.Robert Lewandowski has already netted twice today for Bayern, taking his season’s total to 33. Not a bad effort.A lot of clubs have used their lower tiers to promote supporters groups and the like. West Brom have just stuck massive adverts over the seats for Marc Darcy Menswear and some underwhelming whiskey.Lucas Joao provides a deft touch to a cross. For those trying to watch matches at home ...West Brom look confident and bright here, already getting a decent amount of possession in the opposition half. Birmingham might not be able to cope here.Birmingham have nothing really to play for, so have released all their soon-to-be out-of-contract players and have seven academy players on the bench. Questions the whole integrity of the restart. Gio Reyna has just set up Erling Haaland to give Dortmund the lead. Great combination work from the two sons for former Man City players. Here we go for even more football!All over at the Den. Derby complete a fine win, that keeps them in the very crowded mix for the play-offs, and draws them level on points with MillwallI say that but Millwall have got one back, deep into injury time from Connor Mahoney.And Sibley has a hat-trick, and an impressive Derby win is sealed.A bit of team news for the big 3pm games:And here’s Ed Aarons’ report from Craven Cottage:Brentford struck twice late on to secure an impressive victory at Fulham. Meanwhile, at the Riverside, Swansea were out of sight by half-time to put Middlesbrough in further trouble at the bottom.The visitors break from a Fulham corner and the ball makes its way to Marcondes, who cuts back onto his left foot and fires home frmo 12 yards.Marcondes gets in down the right and fizzes a cross to the back post where Benrahma is lurking and stabs it in.Benrahma curls a free-kick well wide rom 25 yards out. This game is fizzling out.Middlesbrough are yet to concede in the second half, which is good news for them.Another headed chance for Mitrovic but once again the final product lacks power and calmly ends up in Raya’s hands.Reed departs. He had an excellent game for Fulham, providing lots of energy in midfield. No wonder he has tired himself out.There has been plenty of good football at Craven Cottage but the final ball has repeatedly let the teams down. I guess this is the difference between the Premier League and Championship.Brentford’s Baptiste gets the better of Odoi on the left but his pull back from the byline is pounced upon by Rodak.Some very good news from Hull where Angus McDonald starts.Boro complete their subs. No Ravel Morrison, alas.Cavaleiro looks like he is coming on for Fulham, which is exciting news for anyone hoping to see a goal. WHAT A SAVE! Bryan swings in a cracking cross, which Mitrovic steers towards the net with his head but Raya reacts superbly to repel it.Fulham know their market ads for Charles Tyrwhitt are whizzing round the hoardings. Odoi tries to take a throw-in but messes it up and launches it straight up in the air, followed by a shout of “Oh shit!”. Lovely stuff. We are only nine minutes away from getting the Hull team news. Will they be able to field five subs?All square at the break. DISALLOWED GOAL! Mitrovic stands roughly two yards offside before receiving a through ball, which he slots home. Inexplicably he seems to think he was onside and moans at the assistant. There was no need for him to be offside. What a waste. Nifty work from Knockaert allows him to play in Decordova-Reid who has the chance to shoot but instead tries to find Mitrovic in the centre, allowing Dalsgaard to intercept and clear. Watching this game, I definitely think Brentford would be the more fun side to have in the Premier League. They could be the new Norwich.Just a double change for Boro. JR offers: “As a West Brom fan I’ll take anything but a Cottagers win I guess. Big game between the Baggies and the Bees next Friday.“Also, I’ve got one eye on the Watford v Leicester game which reminded me (not that I really needed reminding) what a cheating little er Knockaert is. “That insane playoff finish years back where he ed to win a penalty then then had his penalty and rebound saved then Watford immediately scored to win the semifinal was one of the more satisfying examples of instant justice I can recall.“(To be clear, I don’t call Knockaert a cheating little er just for that incident. I’ve seen him at it on multiple occasions).”Derby are wearing their light blue away at Millwall rather than white against a team in navy. An odd decision. Bayern Munich have now won the league, so there are plenty of changes to their side. New Zealand international Singh starts.All level in the capital as Sibley finds the net from close range.Victor emails in: “Very few things surprise me anymore. However, when I saw today’s Middlesbrough team I was genuinely open mouthed. Only shock is we are only three down at half time. Utterly and completely unacceptable.”I would like to say things can only get better but I am suspicious they could get a lot worse for Boro.Clinton Morrison says Mitrovic should have scored his header in the first half due to the “the form he has been in”. He’s not played for three months, Clinton.A bit of a disaster for Boro.Goalless in the west London derby.

Jacob Steinberg was at Vicarage Road to witness a textbook late bloomer. Here’s his report. Enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM.Leicester remain third in the Premier League table on 54 points. A chance to put a little pressure on second-placed Manchester City was spurned they’re six back on Pep’s reigning champions. Watford meanwhile have a precious point that keeps them out of the relegation zone. Had the match ended 0-1, they would have slipped to 18th, but as things stand they move above West Ham into 17th, a point ahead on 28.Craig Dawson, grinning like the proverbial cream-covered cat speaks. “Yeah it was obviously a great goal and an important point for us. It’s something you practice in training, and obviously it doesn’t go in very often, but I’m delighted with my first goal. The lads worked ever so hard and it was good to get the point in the end. It was disappointing to concede, but great spirit from the lads to go up the other end and get the equaliser. We stuck at it. Great point!”They’re not perfect matches ... but they’ll give you some idea. This classic isn’t a million miles away from Chilwell’s goal ...... while Dawson’s strike was in the same ballpark as this.Leicester will be sick, but in truth that’s the fair result. Both teams attacked, created plenty of chances, and were rewarded with a pair of absolute crackers. Nigel Pearson and Brendan Rodgers seem to agree, smiling warmly as they embrace at the final whistle.The corner clanks off Kabasele, ten yards out. It flies forward to Dawson, who has his back to goal. Dawson swivels and sends an overhead kick powerfully towards the bottom left. Schmeichel sticks out an arm, but can only deflect it into the top left. The acrobatic effort was so sweetly struck, the keeper had no chance!90 min +3: Some head tennis in the Leicester box, and Ndidi is forced to concede a corner. It’s sent in, and ...90 min +2: Deeney is at the centre of a penalty box scramble, but he can’t shift his feet to poke a shot goalwards.90 min +1: Watford have five added minutes to salvage a point.Gray, out on the right, sprays a diagonal pass towards Chilwell out on the left. He takes one touch, and arrows a rising shot across Foster, off the top of the right-hand post, and into the net! The moment that left his boot, it was always going in. What a strike!89 min: Sarr robs Justin out on the left, but then races ahead of the ball to give possession back to Leicester. And then ...88 min: Watford make their final change. Holebas comes on for Masina.87 min: Much better from Chilwell this time, as he hooks into a crowded box. Dawson extends a leg to stab clear with Vardy lurking.86 min: Evans finds Chilwell down the left with a glorious crossfield pass. Chilwell shanks his cross pitifully into the stand behind the goal. He cocks his head back, a Pez dispenser of frustration.85 min: Kabasele guards the ball out on the right, and buys a cheap free kick off a clumsy Maddison. A free kick, and a chance to load the box. Hughes curls it towards Deeney, but Soyuncu wins the battle and Leicester clear.83 min: That’s Albrighton’s last contribution of the afternoon. He’s replaced by Iheanacho.81 min: Leicester are dominating now. Watford are sitting back, a little too deep. It’s possible they’ve decided one point is so precious they’re best not to roll the dice for three. But it’s a dangerous game. Albrighton wins a corner down the right. Foster plucks it from the sky, but Hornet hearts would have been in mouths for a second there.79 min: Perhaps unsurprisingly, the play’s a little bit disjointed all of a sudden.77 min: Three changes for Watford. Femenia, Capoue and Doucoure are replaced by Cleverley, Chalobah and Mariappa. This is like the rugby, or the aftermath of a half-time Mourinho tantrum.76 min: Nothing comes of the Leicester corner, and Tielemans is replaced by Chowdhury.75 min: Gray shimmies in from the left and rolls the ball towards Albrighton on the right. Albrighton creams a rising effort towards the top right it’s beaten Foster all ends up, but crashes off the inside of the post, across the front of goal, and away. Leicester come again, Maddison pearling a low shot towards the bottom right. Foster fingertips around the post spectacularly. Two astonishing efforts! How did that Albrighton one, in particular, not go in?!73 min: Both teams are trying to get on the front foot in search of the opening goal. Maddison nearly forces a pass down the left to spring Gray clear Welbeck drives down the middle on an attempted break. Nothing coming off yet, but this game doesn’t deserve to end goalless.71 min: The game restarts, everyone refreshed. It’s the taste!69 min: Watford make their first change: Welbeck for Pereyra. And that’s drinks!68 min: Vardy chases a speculative pass down the right. He gets there, but there’s nobody in support, and he’s visibly frustrated at the lack of options. But he holds the ball up, and it’s eventually shifted wide left for Gray, who cuts inside and attempts a curler towards the top right. It’s high and wide, but not egregiously so.67 min: Gray’s immediately in the thick of it, demanding the ball and firing a pass wide right for Justin, whose low cross is well dealt with by Dawson.65 min: A straight swap for Leicester City, as Barnes is replaced out on the left wing by Gray.63 min: Leicester are beginning to work their way back into this, after a quiet start to the second half. Maddison probes down the right and wins a corner. His surprise low pullback is missed by Deeney and Vardy, who both take fresh-air swipes, but eventually Watford clear.61 min: Maddison’s delivery is delicious, dipping towards the far post. Soyuncu should head home from six yards, but knocks it down and left of the target. Soyuncu’s header might have brushed Dawson’s flailing arm, but the Leicester man looked offside, so it’s all moot.60 min: Justin waltzes down the right and is lightly brushed by Deeney. He goes down and wins a very generous free kick. Maddison will take this, with the box loaded.58 min: Hughes and Pereyra nearly open Leicester up out on the left. Not quite, but the hosts are asking most of the questions here. Leicester may make a change soon, with Gray sent out to warm up.56 min: Sarr backs himself in a footrace with Chilwell. It’s no contest. Sarr whips in from the right. Pereyra claims to have been impeded at the far post by a light Justin shove, but the referee isn’t interested at all. No penalty.54 min: Hughes slides a ball down the left for Pereyra, who drops a shoulder and creams a shot-cum-cross goalwards. A combination of Schmeichel and several of his defenders manage to deflect the ball away from danger. Leicester stream up the other end, Vardy haring after a long pass, and nearly getting there too. But Foster comes out of his area to acrobatically clear. No goals, but it’s good fun, this.52 min: Barnes, Chilwell and Maddison combine smoothly down the left. Maddison prepares to burst into space, but he’s cheekily clipped by Capoue. Nothing that earns a booking it’s smart but cynical. The wind is removed from the Leicester sail.50 min: Watford go so close again! Sarr clips a cute ball down the right to send Kiko scampering towards the byline. Kiko loops towards the far post, where Deeney rises above Justin to win a header he had no right to win. His powerful downwards header bounces inches wide of the left-hand post. Had that been on target, Schmeichel was beaten. Watford have had their chances today!48 min: Leicester are pressing forward. But they lose possession. Capoue rakes a fine direct long pass to release Sarr, who flies clear of Chilwell and Soyuncu. It looks like the opening goal’s a-coming, but Sarr’s attempt to slip the ball past Schmeichel is denied by a strong left arm. What a save! Even so, Watford should be leading.47 min: Tielemans dribbles gently down the middle, having been sent scampering forward by a fine midfield-splitting Maddison pass. He’s upended, so this is a chance for Maddison to send a dead ball whistling goalwards ... but he blooters it straight into the wall.We go again! Watford get the second half underway. No changes. “Having watched the impending calamity that is Victor Lindelof yesterday, it’s striking how solid and reliable Jonny Evans looks week in, week out at Leicester,” begins rhetorical questioning’s Justin Kavanagh. “A pro’s career is a lot about timing, I suppose, but when you think about the money they’ve spent on defenders since 2015, wouldn’t Manchester United have been a lot better served if they’d just hung onto Evans?” In a television studio somewhere, a former United captain nods his head sadly.More half-time entertainment. We’re really spoiling you today. Here’s our new Forgotten Stories podcast series. Get on it, you won’t regret it.Half-time entertainment. The Championship has restarted today. Catch up with what’s been going on ... but don’t forget to come back, y’all.Just enough time for Sarr, set clear by a stunning diagonal pass from Hughes, to sling yet another ball in from the right. Pereyra and Kabasele get in each other’s way at the far post, and a magnificent chance is spurned. And that’s the end of the opening period. Leicester started strongly, but Watford were the team carving out chances towards the end of the half. A fourth consecutive 2-1 win for Watford in this particular fixture is still on.45 min +2: Maddison can’t beat the first man and it’s an easy clearing header for Kiko Femenia.45 min +1: Soyuncu sprays a pass wide right for Albrighton, who earns a corner off Masina. Maddison will take.45 min: There will be three added minutes, the majority of it for the drinks break.44 min: The half begins to peter out.42 min: Sarr rips past Chilwell as though the £60m Chelsea transfer target wasn’t there. He reaches the byline and pulls back, but to nobody in particular, allowing Chilwell to redeem himself by calmly wandering off with the ball.41 min: The free kick’s looped into the mixer. Dawson wins a big header to the left of the Leicester D. The ball bounces towards Schmeichel, who eventually snaffles, although Pereyra nearly got there first with a cheeky toe.40 min: Maddison’s deep delivery is easily cleared by Watford. Doucoure attempts to break down the right, and is caught by the cynical leg of Tielemans, who becomes the first player to go into the referee’s notebook.39 min: Maddison and Barnes take turns to probe purposefully down the left. Both players think about shooting, but take too long about it. But Leicester keep working the ball, and Masina is panicked into flipping Justin into the air out on the right. Free kick.37 min: Maddison whips dangerously towards the far post. Deeney contorts acrobatically to back-head clear from close range. That’s a brilliant clearing header. Evans tries to keep things going for Leicester by crossing from the left, but it’s easy meat for Foster.36 min: Albrighton dribbles with purpose down the right, earning a corner. From which ...34 min: A snap shot by Doucoure from the edge of the box. It flies over the bar. Then Watford come again, Deeney breathing down Ndidi’s neck, forcing the Leicester midfielder to miscontrol. The ball breaks to Doucoure, who is suddenly one on one with Schmeichel. Doucoure slams it straight at the keeper, who should nevertheless still get credit for saving with his legs. The best chance of the match so far.33 min: Pereyra’s free kick instigates a comic-book cloud with arms and legs sticking out of it. At some point unclear to the human eye, the ball sails off into the stand.32 min: Kiko is upended by Maddison out on the right. That was wholly unnecessary, the Watford man was going nowhere. A free kick and a chance for Watford to sling something into the mixer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a2e0faf67f20dba3949fc27387106fb3199cf02/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32efafbf2a14be03fcc80cca205e71ce","title":"share your reviews of the last of us part ii","story":"The sequel to Naughty Dog’s hit video game is finally here, but what did you make of it?

In this, the sequel to 2013’s isive, post-apocalyptic The Last of Us, you play as Ellie, a young woman immune to the virus that has during the past 25 years devastated North America, turning most of the population into zombies. Only pockets of survivors are left, living in fractious scavenger communities.This adventure game, which mostly takes place in Seattle, is a revenge story that charts, in preposterously high definition, Ellie’s physical and psychological descent into violence. It’s brutal stuff (offset by odd moments of guitar-twanging downtime): you hear the gurgling death rattles, see the puddling blood, survey images of the kind of brutality and its aftermath that usually exist only in police files and on the dark web.The game sets various new high-water marks in terms of its spectacular production. The crumbling vistas, exquisitely rendered faces and memorable action set pieces all dazzle, while the poised dialogue casts a lingering spell. But the central message, which hinges on the kind of structural conceit of a boldness and invention almost never seen in this category of big budget crowd-pleasers, is less readily convincing. During the course of the game Ellie kills hundreds of zombies and humans from different hostile factions – a particularly American conception of human survival: gun-toting and ravenously dog-eat-dog. As she does so, you witness and become inveigled by the corrupting influence of her chosen behaviours.Later, during a flashback, Ellie must use a sniper rifle to take potshots at zombies shuffling on a hill across a sunlit valley. Once you get your eye in, compensating for each bullet’s gravitational drop, the thrill of guiltless cause and effect is shared between character and player. The game’s violence is designed, through years of iteration, to be deeply enjoyable, a fact that threatens to undercut its message that violence is a corrupting, abhorrent cycle.There is virtue in interrogating the gun violence around which the video game blockbuster has become orientated, and The Last of Us Part 2 offers a profound and thoughtful attempt to cause the player to dwell on what it means to aim a gun at another human being and pull the trigger. But it cannot wholly shake off the fact that its core message conflicts with its fundamental pleasures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/747894f0be66e7cbe8a2b8f9b5d6ff12953032a8/0_404_6064_3639/master/6064.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1b52ec7f3125c5dbffece51dfb7bbcfd","title":"got pregnant by mistake single motherhood","story":"Having a baby lay somewhere in the future.

I just thought those children would grow up with me and their yet-to-materialise father in a lovely farmhouse, hugged by the hills, with an Aga and a dog and long, invigorating walks through the fields. This was not how I had grown up in Yorkshire, but it wasn’t a million miles from it either. It was an idealised version of home, and it lived somewhere vaguely in my future as an unspecified certainty.Exactly how I thought La Vida Farmhouse was going to appear when I was, in fact, living in a one-bedroom rented apartment in West Hollywood in 2010 isn’t clear. My apartment was just behind the Sunset Strip part of Sunset Boulevard. The Strip is the glamorously cheesy bit, full of rooftop pools and famous people, and it was a place that encouraged in me a relationship with reality that could at best be described as negligible. I was working as a journalist, interviewing Hollywood celebrities for newspapers and magazines back home.This was unreal life, where a friend offered me a free place on a health retreat on a ranch in Mexico, and I’d go to power yoga lessons where they told me and the wealthy Californians who surrounded me to feel the pain, and I felt the pain so much that I could barely manage the trip back to LA. By the time we got home I was unable to sit down. A day after that I was in the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Beverly Hills, which was the place where Paris Hilton and co would end up after paparazzi-induced car crashes and the Kardashians would give birth. It was, improbably, my local hospital.It wasn’t clear to anyone quite where this agony was coming from, or if it had anything to do with the exercise at all. I spent a whole day being wheeled around to different tests, and having a cash machine wheeled right up to my face by a credit-cardiologist. Finally they told me that there was good news and bad news. The good news was that the MRI scan had revealed the main problem: I had something like a slipped disc. I would not need surgery and it would resolve itself naturally within a week or two if I was sensible and simply became addicted to industrial-strength painkillers instead. Something like that.The bad news, however, was that while they were poking around, they had discovered some trouble in my ovaries. Oh, I know about that, I said, I was diagnosed as having polycystic ovary syndrome in my 20s, I’ve been told it’s probably fine. Well, it isn’t fine now, they said, it’s much worse, and coupled with your hormone levels and your age and – hang on a minute, I thought, your age? I was only just into my 30s – all right, I was 34 – but nobody had ever said your age to me in that tone of voice, suggesting that I had used a lot of my age up already, rather than not had enough of it yet. Regardless, the doctor continued, I had the best kind of infertility, because I could still carry a child in my own womb. It was just that I would not be able to conceive naturally. In my life, it was as if I was the captain of a magnificent ship but was somehow always in a dinghy buffeted about in the ship’s wake, about to catch up with myself. Up ahead on the magnificent ship, I was organised and sober and slim and shiny-haired. This infertility news was the first thing to finally break through to me that the ship had sailed off without me. I went home, shut the door of my apartment and cried for a week.What an idiot I had been, thinking that I could go back and make a family later, that I could work out how to have a relationship with a nice man later. I didn’t know any nice men. What I knew were exciting men, egotistical men, men who ran fast, whom you could sometimes run alongside, as long as you didn’t let out a single whisper of genuine need.I told my friend Mal about this most awful diagnosis that had made me reconsider my whole life. And when my monologue ended, he smiled and said, “Sophie, all the doctors have said to you is that you can only get pregnant on purpose, not by accident. That’s it. Which is, as you would say, brilliant. So I think you should celebrate this amazing news by going out and fucking like it’s the 1970s.”And that is the story of how I didn’t use a condom the next time I had sex, which would turn out to be the very next day, which turned into the story of how I became somebody’s mother for the rest of our lives, the end. Except it’s not the end, is it? It never is.I remember feeling particularly hot that next night, as I left my apartment with Mal’s fantastically bad advice still ringing in my ears. I remember trying to walk confidently straight past the hotel reception desk, then stopping round the next corner to secretly check the text message again. Then I was beside the swimming pool, deserted but still floodlit. I remember hearing a noise and looking up and seeing him, a man I’ll call the Musician, grinning down at me.We had known each other for about seven years by this point, ever since a mutual friend had introduced us backstage after one of his shows and our eyes had locked. Once again, we were now wrapped around each other like we had something to prove, and I suppose we did, even though I would spend many years afterwards wondering what it was. I took a big gulp of the whisky that was on my side of the bed while I laughed and said that we didn’t need to use anything, because I definitely couldn’t get pregnant.The next day, when I got home, I sat down at my computer, opened a blank document and typed a paragraph that began with these words: “And one day I will tell you all about how you were conceived in a hotel room in Hollywood.” My hands seemed to be typing by themselves. A wave of anger rushed over me. It felt as if something beyond me had written it. I didn’t like it. Hadn’t I been told, just 10 days previously, that I would never conceive a child naturally? Was I taunting myself with a child who had already turned out to be a ghost?I slammed the laptop shut and got on with my day.Christmas and New Year came and went, and I found I didn’t like the taste of alcohol any more. I pretended to be doing Dry January, hiding the very confusing, nagging feeling that eventually led to me taking a pregnancy test.A couple of days after the test, I had to tell him. I had to summon up all of the strength inside me to break it to the Musician that he was going to be a father. I didn’t know if we were starting a family or starting a war. My best news – and it was, truly, starting to feel like my best news – could be his worst. The terrifying thing was that I had to tell him over the phone because sending a text saying “We’re having a baby” seemed a little informal.He was thousands of miles away and not expecting to hear from me. In fact, I talked so fast when he answered that he couldn’t hear what I said, which meant I had to take a deep breath and deliver my big news all over again. These phone conversations continued, over the weeks, turning into a big old argument: disbelief, terror and sometimes tenderness, too. And every time I would put my hands to my belly, where barely anything existed beyond a particle theory of cells. I knew the miraculous accident was here to stay.Later that week I spent hours in my local bookshop, nervously scanning the shelves for a guide to show me the way. All I could find were books called things like What To Expect When You’re Expecting, full of advice on folic acid and how your husband should give you a back rub to ease the tension of growing another person inside your person.What I longed for was a book called What To Expect When You Weren’t Even Fucking Expecting To Be Expecting, which would tell you what to do when you found yourself standing on Santa Monica pier holding your phone in your trembling hand, desperate to hurl it into the Pacific Ocean so the thoughts of a scared man couldn’t buzz through it any more. We had to stay in regular communication, and sometimes it could be sweet, even, on a very good day, to the point of us discussing potential baby names we liked. We weren’t going to become a couple, but there were moments when we could be friends. But mostly it was a battle.I tried to find a bigger apartment in LA, one more suited to babies and less to parties. Nobody would rent one to me, not once they’d taken a look at my rapidly growing bump and my rapidly shrinking income. With my tail between my legs, I moved back to London and began attending antenatal classes, where the husbands and boyfriends were taught all the helpful things they could do. I experienced the class solely as a guide to heteronormative marriage practices, with me the only single person there, feeling like the extra prick at a wedding.Of course, this shouldn’t have been a thing in open-minded London in the 21st century. I was hardly being forced into a home for unmarried mothers and having my baby adopted against my will. Technically, I had nothing to feel ashamed of, but shame is tidal at certain times it wells up and surges on to the land. The loneliness of the long-distance runner has nothing on the loneliness of the single person in an antenatal class.So imagine my delight when, about halfway through the course, one of the dads took offence at being told he should probably give up smoking, and he left. The numbers balanced out fine after that. I find it odd when people say that giving birth was the single best day of their life. I can safely say that giving birth was the single worst day of my life. All right, the single worst two days of my life. I was 18 days overdue when I finally let them induce me, and it was 48 hours after that when they cut the baby out of my womb. My daughter is the best thing in my existence, but I can quite clearly separate loving my daughter from not enjoying 10 different doctors waggling their poky things up my chuff.There’s another bit of labour I find hard to write about. The bit where the Musician, who had been going to come, and then not going to come, then did come, somewhere around midnight, when I’d gone deep into an animal state. Or so I thought. The bit where he’d sat at the far end of the bed, too far away, and he finally stood up and I thought he was coming towards me so I reached out my arms to touch him. I needed that contact. But I had misread the movement and he was in fact standing up to leave the room. A cheery goodbye came from him as I lay there, contracting, the midwives and doctors looking at me as my arms tried to find a place to fold themselves back into. I was no longer an animal. I was shame.But then I was made into two. In the operating theatre, a baby was passed over the white curtain to me and she was my daughter, she was a broken star, a bloodied astronaut, a bloodied moon. She was a missile coming straight for me an answer to the question that my body asked without me knowing. She was the smallest person I had ever held and the biggest thing I had ever seen. An alien who clearly knew everything about everything. I cried involuntarily. It came from me like a bark.The baby’s face was lopsided, one eye more closed than the other, a big red mark across her forehead, and I didn’t know how to ask if that was how she was always going to look, if I would reveal a lack of love by already wanting her to be different at 28 seconds old. Some time later, we were wheeled along the corridor to meet her father, and as we arrived I felt an acute sense of embarrassment. I felt an even more acute sense that this was not how it is supposed to feel when you present a man with his baby.Three months later, and a live human male person was actually chatting me up at a party. For the first time in a year, I did not have a baby inside my womb, or hanging from my breast, or snoring beside me in a pram.Of course, most new mothers go out to have some respite from the four walls that surround them, and the feeling of being needed at every second of every day, and while those were my goals, too, I also had another motive. I had come out on the pull.Pregnancy is not an ideal time to meet someone, but I’d got through that, and was now in the afterwards stage where you’re merely leaking milk from your breasts. So that was fine. In fact, it was more than fine – because said milk was making them enormous.The man trying to talk to me was a real grownup in a suit jacket. When he introduced himself, I immediately felt the whooshing rush to my heart that could only mean one thing: total inadequacy.“What do you do?” he asked.I told him I was a journalist: “But… I’m not really working at the moment.” Oh God, quick, Sophie, salvage it.“Because I’ve just had a baby!” I added, hurriedly.Looking into his confused eyes, I realised my mistake.“But I’ve already split up with the dad!” I barked, solving everything.My brain helpfully nipped back in for one killer finale.“In fact, I actually had the baby on my own.”I didn’t get to find out what he thought, because, oh my God, he turned around to talk to someone else. I went and sat at a table with some people I vaguely knew, and was still laughing to myself, wheezing with relief that I would never again have to experience The First Time A Man Chats Me Up After Having A Baby On My Own.The private clinic was as white as the “here comes the science part” of a L’Oréal advert. We gave our names at the desk and waited to be called. There wasn’t much small talk between the two of us adults. The baby slept. We went into the private room. The doctor seemed highly intelligent, talking us through the clinical procedure before explaining that she was legally obliged to ask us why we were having it. I decided to sit this one out. And so we waited, the doctor and I, both turning to look at the Musician. I think I may, for a nanosecond, have even enjoyed the look on his face.“We just, we just want to be sure,” he stuttered. It was an innovative usage of the first person plural, seeing as I was perfectly sure already. “Just, you know, just for the avoidance of doubt,” he added, nodding as if everyone was already agreeing with him. The doctor and I both knew that nobody in that room was agreeing with him.“The baby doesn’t have to be woken for the procedure,” she explained, “as we can swab her mouth for the saliva sample while she’s asleep in her pram. You won’t even need to take the covers off.” My relief was marred only by my disappointment that nobody would now get to see what I had dressed my four-month-old in – a grey babygrow that had one word lovingly stitched across it: Daddy.The doctor swabbed each of our mouths with a separate sterile bud, which then went into sealed plastic bags. When it was all done, the credit card handed over and the receipt signed with my blood – I mean his pen – he and I stood outside on the street and looked all around us. It was preferable to looking at each other.And then the Musician and I tried to talk, but only revolting angry words came out. I began to walk away, pushing the pram down the street. The shouting carried on at my back. I pushed the baby to the end of the street, and then round the corner to the end of another street, and then suddenly I was free.Still, the child maintenance payments continued to arrive. Sometimes they felt like a mockery. Sometimes they felt like an apology. Sometimes they just felt like a great big help and it was a relief. The months passed into years, and the anger turned into pain, and the pain turned into a ghost that sat on my shoulder for many years and flicked my nerves while allowing me to live. But life takes its snaking turns around unexpected corners, and we are on better terms now and beyond. Family life has changed again. I was always grateful for my best ever present, one given to me in a curious pocket of magic that we had somehow slipped into in the California moonlight, and if I think about what my life would have been without her – my diminutive partner in crime, and in beauty, and in fart jokes – I almost can’t breathe again. She has his sense of humour. It’s a very good one.We are a small republic of two, my daughter and I. We sit at the breakfast table every morning, staring across at each other like Frost and Nixon. And every day she says, “Mummy, look at my sad face.” And I say, “That’s not very sad, look at my sad face” and I do a mournful expression the same as hers, only I let my jaw hang down and let one of my eyes tilt to the side, as if I am dying, and she giggles and says, “No, Mummy, look at my sad face” and she copies all of mine but adds an enormous sigh to it, a sigh that knocks her head practically off her neck, and so I say, “Look at my sad face” and I do everything she did but I also fall off my chair on purpose and collapse on to the kitchen floor at some personal discomfort and start to cry out, rending my garments, “I am so sad, oh Lord why hast thou forsaken me” and then my daughter is almost hysterical with rancid delight and joins me on the floor, crying out, “Oh Lord, why have shaking” because that’s what she thinks I’ve said, and then we remember that it’s 8.42am on a school day and I have to get her hair into two French plaits that I learned by watching a YouTube instructional video 11 times.We grab our coats and run along the street and get there before they close the gates at 9am. We always make it just in the nick of time, and we hug each other goodbye, and she goes up the stairs to her classroom, but stops at the big landing window and waves down at me again. We both bump a fist on to our hearts to show that we will carry each other in there all day.Some might think a romance between a parent and child is not healthy. What would they think if it came from a father who wanted his little girl to know that she was beautiful? I have had to provide both things, the romance and the rules. A single parent is both structure and playground, walls and soft landing, good cop and bad cop. You don’t ready someone to travel into a famine zone by starving them, so I have prepared my child for an ugly world by fattening her with love, like a foie gras goose. And when we are sad, we sit there being sad, crying, accepting, until we can laugh again.As a child, I learned that sadness makes people uncomfortable, and it still makes me uncomfortable, if I’m honest. But what I know now is that it doesn’t always want to be fixed – rather it wants to be heard. In our house, I have made room for it, so it can come and go like familiar visitors do. It makes the happiness less frantic. I tried a lot of cures for existential angst, but becoming this person’s mother was definitely the one. She gives me somewhere to put all that love I’d been wasting on my fears. I want to be the safe place my daughter turns to at night, and wakes up to in the morning. The safe harbour. Unconditional. Not everybody gets one of those. • The Hungover Games by Sophie Heawood is published by Jonathan Cape on 16 July at £14.99. To order a copy for £12.89 go to bookshop.

I usually spend a lot on plants, but I’ve realised I don’t need to. My polytunnels and greenhouse are as good as a plant fair.”Hunting Brook Gardens, 45 minutes from Dublin, is a contemporary garden making bold use of colour, running up around a charming timber cabin where Blake lives. The cabin doubles as a teaching studio, with a programme that includes workshops on health and wellbeing. The 20-acre site dips into a wooded valley, mossy and damp, with a trickling stream that gives the garden its name, and soars again into a wildflower meadow with views of the Wicklow mountains beyond.Blake, who trained at Dublin’s National Botanic Gardens, has travelled the world hunting for rare, exotic plants, including his extensive collection of araliaceae, with evergreen scheffleras and the towering aralias he collected as seeds on a plant trip to China. Hunting Brook has erse growing conditions, from full sun to deep protected shade Blake’s willingness to experiment means he has managed to grow a wide variety of plants, although the garden sits at nearly 1,000ft (300m).When you enter, you’re confronted by exuberant dry beds full of huge aeoniums and succulents hot tropical spots explode into colour, with the towering spiny tree, Aralia echinocaulis and dahlias and alstroemerias sit among swaying grasses and big-leaved exotica. There are cool dappled woodlands full of ferns and erythroniums and, in the deep shade of a gorge, scheffleras mingle with native mossy saxifrage. Plants from every corner of the globe are, often improbably, joyously partnered – strange-looking pseudopanax rise out from Geum ‘Totally Tangerine’ – creating a rich brocade of plant life.When he was forced to close Hunting Brook’s gates, Blake took solace in the garden. “At the beginning, I sat in my favourite tree in the valley, worrying about money and thinking, how am I going to survive this?” he says. That tree is an old beech. “It’s the most effective therapist I’ve had.”Blake may have been by himself, but hasn’t felt as alone as he had imagined. “I’ve felt supported by my plants, the trees, the birds.”And although he has missed the lifeblood of the visitors, he has enjoyed having it to himself, too. No one, not even the old beech, knows what the next months will bring, but Blake wants to hold on to this newfound relationship with his garden. He has just reopened it to visitors, but will make sure there are more moments for just himself and his plants. Euphorbia rigida An upright, early-flowering spurge, with acid-green flowers in late spring. Grows to 60cm. Geum ‘Totally Tangerine’ Reliable, loved by pollinators, and combines well with purples, such as Penstemon ‘Raven’, and grasses such as Stipa tenuissima. Schefflera delavayi A hardy, exotic shrub or small tree with spectacular large terminal heads of white flower in summer.Michelia doltsopa ‘Silver Cloud’ The new magnolia with heavenly scented white flowers.

I wanted to create a safe space where we could focus on our finances,” she says.The ethnicity gap does not stop at pay – the inequality that begins there runs through everything involving money. Almost across the board people of colour are worse off than their white counterparts and, typically, black households face the biggest deficit. Compared with white households they have lower earnings and less cash in private pensions, investments or other assets to draw on.According to a recent report by the Runnymede Trust, Black African and Bangladeshi households have only 10p of savings and assets for every £1 of white British wealth.Some of the issues are explained by the demographics of the community: black people are generally younger and live in cities, so may have higher living costs and have had less time to build up wealth. Plus, some pay gap figures reflect inequalities around education and opportunity.Otegha Uwagba is a writer and the founder of Women Who. She is working on a book called We Need To Talk About Money, which will be published next year. She says people often make the argument that the pay difference is a result of people clustering around low-paid industries. “But even when you compare people with identical qualifications doing identical jobs in the same geographical area, there is still a difference in pay,” she says. “It’s hard to find any other reason for that beyond racism.”She adds: “Why aren’t we doing the same thing with mandatory disclosures around the ethnicity pay gap as we have around the gender pay gap? Racism is a really ugly part of British history that people just don’t want to face up to.”It may not fix the problem entirely – figures show black workers are more likely to be agency staff than white workers and pay audits mask disparities between staff and outsourced workers. But it will shine a spotlight on the issues.Cole calls the figures “very poor” considering the government has set a target for every boardroom to have BAME representation by next year. One of the problems is “lazy recruitment”, she says. “People continue to hire in their likeness – they recruit from the same small pool of candidates who went to the same small pool of universities and have the same background.”Cole says there is a lack of career progression within firms but also an underlying issue around expectation and experience. “As a person of colour, you often don’t realise there is the opportunity for you to do these jobs,” she says. “There are no role models – when you are at school they talk about considering something in the entertainment industry or something in sport … A lot of schoolchildren don’t know these jobs exist because their parents don’t do them and they don’t know people who do. They perceive there is no one who looks like them who has succeeded.”“Money begets more money. Discrimination compounds things and wealth and income gaps are passed on to the next generation.” Even when the inequalities in pay are ironed out, it will be some time before all the other gaps are closed.With fewer assets to pass down, the problem grows. It is not only the wealth that accumulates, but also the knowledge about how to make the most of your money.Flavius is on the property ladder, thanks to help from her mum. “My mother came over here as a Caribbean woman and worked super hard, day and night to get on the property ladder and then she helped us, so I’m very lucky. But that is where the knowledge stops.”While those from wealthy backgrounds may learn from their parents about building up assets, she says “you don’t have that generational knowledge passed down”. Her website is somewhere where women from similar backgrounds can share tips and help each other meet their goals. Many of the organisations she recommends are not specifically geared towards any community but she says it was the Black Investor 360 show that opened her eyes to investment opportunities.Again, representation is important to show people that they have these chances, she says. “If you see people who look like you doing the things that you want to do, then that helps,” she says. “The women I speak to are very different – some have just left college or school and are starting out, while some are older than me and have maybe come into some money. Some of them have never seen a financial adviser and don’t know where to start.”1) Research from the Runnymede Trust shows the vast differences in wealth and assets between households of different ethnicity. The figures show that that for every £1 a white British family has, black Caribbean households have about 20p and black African and Bangladeshi households approximately 10p. Accumulated assets offer a safety net when things go wrong and can be passed down through generations.3) Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, pensioner families received an average of £533 a week in total income, including money from occupational pensions, personal pensions, investments and the state. Black households were the least likely to receive personal pensions or income from other investments and most likely to receive benefits on top of the state pension. Their total income was lower than other groups."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234b988b35a6d9b049c49ae40f05d1a1b740a780/0_597_5227_3137/master/5227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dfe571af8c0f79b487b0a2f8e3db19b","title":"travel summer holidays flights ferries insurance rights","story":"From flights, ferries and quarantine to staycations and insurance, the lowdown on your rightsThe Ryanair email sent out to millions of people this week was certainly enticing, advertising up to 250,000 seats from £29.99 each on one of the 1,000 flights a day that the airline will be running from 1 July. Reading the long list of destinations on offer, you could almost forget that the UK government is still advising against all holiday travel. But it is, so if you have a trip planned – or are desperate to get one in the diary – here’s what you need to know.Since 23 March the government has advised against all travel outside the UK and until that changes, holiday travel abroad is on hold. It means no tour operator can resume services and people venturing abroad under their own steam will have no insurance cover. Ministers have indicated that consumers should know when and if the ban will be lifted by 4-5 July, which is, coincidentally, when pubs, restaurants and hotels in England look set to partially reopen.Expect any lifting of the FCO ban to focus on European countries first, possibly from 11 July, but to be kept in place for higher-risk destinations.There is nothing to stop you booking flights or a holiday before the advice changes, but you do so at your own risk. A second wave of coronavirus infections, either here or at your chosen destination, would result in bans and lockdowns being swiftly reimposed, as has happened in Beijing this week.A lifting of the travel ban will almost certainly have to coincide with either the introduction of “air bridges” – agreements with countries guaranteeing that people can travel between the two without quarantining – or a lifting of quarantine for selected destinations.The UK quarantine has been in place since 8 June and is being reviewed for the first time on Monday 29 June. This would allow a partial lifting in time for 4 July or, more likely, a week or two later when the school holidays start. But nothing is certain.There would be little point in the FCO allowing Britons to travel to European destinations while the Home Office kept its quarantine in place and other countries continued to apply their reciprocal two-week quarantines.Spain has said it would expect this to be waived before it let Britons arrive there, unrestricted. The French president was in London on Thursday making the same point.Expect a workaround allowing some travel around 11 July or, more likely, a week later – assuming no deterioration in the pandemic – but, again, don’t count on it.If the quarantines are not lifted, it is unlikely tour operators will resume operations.Those booking package holidays are covered if the tour operator cancels the trip, although as the past few weeks have shown, you may face a significant wait for a refund and come under pressure to take vouchers instead.TuiFirst Choice has cancelled all holidays before 10 July and is waiting for a government announcement before deciding what happens next.If you book your own flights and accommodation for a July or August trip now you are taking a big risk.Ryanair is offering customers booking now the chance to change the flights at a later date without facing a fee. However, buyers can only switch to flights running up until 31 December, which will not suit those looking for summer sun. You will also have to pay any difference in fares, which could be more than the original booking. EasyJet is allowing passengers to switch flights up to 14 days before departure without a change fee, provided travel restrictions remain.Plenty of hotel chains are offering free cancellations to those prepared to take the chance and book a visit. Hotel deals are very competitively priced right now. It you are feeling brave, there are some lovely hotel rooms in Europe at hostel prices.Booking an expensive trip further afield to, say, South Africa or South America, and even Australasia, right now looks like folly.In a word no. Insurance is there to cover unforeseen eventualities, and clearly that is not the case here and now. The Post Office, this week, put its travel policies back on the market having previously withdrawn them. These policies will cover buyers for medical costs if they contract Covid-19 while abroad, but they pointedly exclude any cancellation claims that arise due to a second outbreak.Most insurers have said that bookings made after the pandemic was declared in March will not to be covered for Covid-related claims.This is set to be the next battleground for lots of UK consumers, and the problems are already starting. This week, a reader contacted us to complain that easyJet had moved his 2 July flight from Luton to Geneva to a booking from Gatwick the following day, as a “flight amendment”. He felt the move was designed to avoid the airline cancelling his flight and having to refund him. He has since been offered vouchers instead.Lots of Britons will be booked onto flights departing in July that will not be cancelled, irrespective of whether travel restrictions are in place or not.Those who find themselves in that position will either have to take replacement vouchers – where offered – or claim on their travel insurance – provided they booked the flight before March.Once travel restrictions are lifted, many of those deciding that they don’t want to get on a packed plane face losing considerable sums spent on DIY trips, unless a medical reason precludes them from travelling and they can make a case to their insurer.Airlines with several flights a day to, say Budapest may opt to merge them to accommodate fewer passengers. Most airlines have the right to change the time and even the date of flights, set out in their terms and conditions. Allowed changes of 3-5 hours are typical for short haul operators, but changes of up to 12 hours on long-haul legs are allowed.The airline must tell passengers at least 14 days in advance of such a change, and it cannot change the flight number as this is considered a cancellation, meaning a refund is due. Expect more of this over the coming months, and airlines refusing refunds on the basis that flights, albeit at different times, and even at different airports, were offered.Currently, big operators have cancelled all holidays up to early July, and are waiting to hear from the authorities before deciding what happens next.Mark Warner says it is “confident” that the restrictions will be lifted in time for all its holidays from 9 July onwards to operate as planned.Tui is allowing anyone who booked a trip before 16 March for travel until 31 August the option to switch to any of its holidays currently on sale.Again, if the restrictions are lifted, your holiday goes ahead, but you don’t want to risk it, you face losing your money – or having to accept a credit note at best. Right now it is still against the rules to stay overnight outside your home unless you are a single personparent and you have formed a bubble with another household.Again, this looks set to change in England, possibly as soon as 4 July. Some English hotels and campsites are hoping to reopen from around this time, or as soon as they are given the all clear.Wales said on Friday that it would reopen for tourism from 6 July. Scotland aims to open to visitors on 15 July, while for Northern Ireland – and the Republic – it’s 20 July. While lots of people will be pinning their hopes on a camping holiday, which could be considered the least risky Covid-19 holiday, there is still uncertainty in the sector concerning shared toilets and washing facilities.The Camping and Caravan Club says it expects some campsites to initially open without toilets and showers, which is fine for those in a caravan, but less helpful to tent users. It has a list of its sites that it expects to open this summer. Arguably, yes. Eurotunnel, P\u0026ampO and Stena all carried on operating passenger services throughout the crisis, some with reduced services, but all are taking bookings now. To enter France you currently need to fill in a health questionnaire.P\u0026ampO is quoting £300 for a return with a car in mid-July coming back a week later. Currently there are no foot passengers allowed. Eurotunnel is quoting similar prices, and this has the added advantage that you stay in your own car for the whole journey.DFDS is also taking passenger bookings for its routes, including the Newhaven-Dieppe route.Brittany Ferries which operates to ports in Western France, such as St Malo is hoping to resume passenger services in the last week in June. Passengers can make bookings on the website. Stena continues to run its services between Harwich and Hook of Holland. It’s probably wise to opt for refundable tickets.

OK, it’s hard to completely lose yourself between your bathroom and the front room. But part of the magic of Glastonbury comes from the sheer commitment: giving up home comforts and signing up to a weekend of the unknown. So let’s do this properly. Get in the shower and have a deep scrub, it will be your last for the weekend.18:00 Decant all your spirits into plastic bottles, stick on a denim gilet and a pair of wellies. Fill your car, or failing that a bathtub, with three packets of Percy Pigs, a bag of satsumas and an unlabelled plastic bottle of water that’s been sitting around since last year but is probably fine. Sit uncomfortably for a few minutes while listening to The Breeze radio, the south-west’s more relaxing music mix. Keep texting in that “you’re on your way to Glastonbury” till you get a shout-out. Congratulations, you’ve made it!20:00 The first thing that hits you when you arrive at the real Glastonbury is the smell: that single-origin blend of bonfires, cowpats and long-drop toilets. Recreating such scents at home is probably a health and safety hazard, but you can still make a nod to the Pilton aroma by sticking a big pot of chai tea on the boil and lighting a few log fire candles. It’s not quite the same but once the no-showering kicks in you’ll start to get those festy top notes.22:00 A number of hardcores over on the Glasthomebury Facebook group are planning to camp in their back gardens. Fair play, but if you don’t fancy having that conversation with your neighbour, perhaps a better midway point is to move your bedding into the front room and set up a bit of a den by scattering fairy lights and wet wipes across the floor. Pour yourself a lukewarm G\u0026ampT, order a takeaway with an inexplicable amount of halloumi in it and settle in. BBC Four is showing Julien Temple’s dreamy 2006 video essay Glastonbury, a perfect primer on the festival’s anti-establishment heritage. Don’t over-exert yourself tonight, there’s a big weekend ahead.10:00 Rise and shine! Time to treat yourself to the Glastonbury breakfast: an ancient grains macrobiotic vegan Buddah bowl and a pint of Tuborg.13:00 The BBC has a mammoth archive of live performances from past years to watch over the weekend, including a dedicated iPlayer channel and classic sets going out on BBC Two and BBC Four in primetime. Just like at the real Glastonbury, though, it is still far too early to be watching any live music. Instead, head to the online Green Fields where Liz Eliot, the area’s curator for decades, has put on a special programme of events. “It’s been really disappointing,” she says, “because I’m 80 this year and was hoping to bow out of this role, but we’re still trying to get that spiritual feel of our area over, while being a little tongue in cheek.” You’ll be able to get your penknife out for craft demonstrations and enjoy free online yoga and qigong. Those missing the gentle back and forth of the festival’s many spoken-word events can hear Sir David King, a scientific adviser to the Blair government, talk about the links between climate change and Covid-19.18:00 It is impossible to ignore the fact that, for some, Glastonbury is a weekend for experimentation with certain substances. Whether that is part of your normal festival experience, it’s probably safe to say that your flatmate isn’t going to appreciate it if you’re in the living room sweating through a T-shirt and flailing your limbs to Frankie Knuckles while they’re trying to teach a Skype numeracy lesson to their year twos. Stay away from any hard stuff: instead we give you permission to crack open your first pear cider of the weekend, a beverage that was basically invented at Glastonbury and now takes up three aisles at Sainsbury’s.20:00 This would have been Kendrick Lamar’s debut headline performance at the festival. In the weeks since the killing of George Floyd, protesters have played Lamar’s music through PAs, boomboxes and megaphones as they demanded an end to racial injustice. This then would have been an impossibly powerful performance, and, whether or not he returns in a year, coronavirus has robbed Kendrick of the biggest stage in music at this decisive moment. For a greater grounding in the politics of his music, try out the Dissect podcast, which has two whole seasons dedicated to his back catalogue.22:00 Weird to think that the headline sets played by Beyoncé (2011) and Jay-Z (2008), which are being shown at 10pm on BBC Two and 11.30pm on BBC Four respectively, came just before these artists’ imperial phases. Indeed, it was arguably these performances that pushed them from being mere world-conquering artists to the only two pop stars your mum knows. Jay’s set was full of peerless cuts from Blueprints 1 and 2 that he doesn’t play live these days, and the unlikely highlight of Beyoncé’s Sunday night set was the somewhat forgotten Irreplaceable: the contrast of her glitzy performance and worse-for-wear sunburnt Somerseters screaming “to the left, to the left” remains one of the most moving things ever to happen on that stage. Likely to make you have a little cry.00:00 Don’t wanna be a killjoy but we are saving it for the big one on Sat so have yourself a hot chocolate and get some rest.14:00 It wouldn’t be Glastonbury without bumping into a celeb who hasn’t been to bed. Spend the next 30 minutes tweeting ALL RIGHT M8! YOU LOOK WRECKED! at Nick Grimshaw and wait to see if he replies.19:00 Glastonbury raises more than £3m for good causes each year, so the event’s cancellation will leave a shortfall in the budgets of Greenpeace, WaterAid and others. They are selling merch on the site to help, though the tea towel is particularly nice and lets people know you were there (in the kitchen). On Saturday (20 Jun) you can also catch the end of the Greenpeace field’s virtual party to celebrate 50 years of activism with sets from Georgia, Rodrigo y Gabriela and – obvs – Billy Bragg. If it’s emotional healing you need, BBC Two are showing Adele’s 2016 headline slot at 9.30pm.00:00 OK, this is it – the all-nighter. Hopefully you’ve got some plastic bottles of Ribena and whisky left, because we are going in. Gather your household together at the front door: this should take an hour of going back and forth, fetching jumpers and all going to the toilet. Next, leave your house and wander around trying to find somewhere in your local area that looks like a vibe (while socially distancing, of course). Occasionally lose each other then spend 20 minutes trying to meet up by shouting: “I’M AT THE 27TH LAMPPOST ON THE RIGHT!” Eventually agree to meet back at home where the Shangri-La area is livestreaming DJ sets all night (in preparation for its own VR festival, Lost Horizon, a week later) and Radio 1’s Essential Mix will be streaming classic Glasto sets from 1am. Keep going, then head to the “stone circle”, which you can fashion in your garden out of some bathroom shelving and pebbles. Take some pots with you for drumming, and pop your head out the door to see if any youths want to sell you a balloon. Keep going until sunrise and then pass out in the kitchen.11:00 After your big night out, you’re going to need to recharge. The Healing Fields are holding daily “online meditations for love, health and peace”. If getting a moment of peace is difficult in your house, there will also be storytelling around a tipi fire over in the online Green Fields with further fun throughout the weekend at a virtual Kidzfield. RAIN BREAK! Rain is as crucial to the Glastonbury experience as leaving all your best mates to spend the entire night with some rando you went to school with. This weekend should be no different, so if there are scattered showers, head out with your umbrella and headphones and blast some of the festival specials. Sounds of the 70s With Johnnie Walker on Sunday afternoon will be playing rarely heard performances from the festival’s first decade, and BBC Sounds has a dedicated Glastonbury channel with loads of full sets to pick from. If you want to go the whole hog, get a pair of those moisturising socks from Superdrug or Boots, which are basically plastic bags filled with lotion it will feel just like cold mud has seeped into your wellies.18:30 Jo Whiley and Mark Radcliffe are hosting a special BBC Two show with the best of the Sunday afternoon legends slot, so expect to see Lionel Richie, Dolly Parton, Brian Wilson, ELO and plenty of bad puns on flags. For many revellers, this is normally the moment when the cumulative comedown hits them and they realise Dancing on the Ceiling is actually the most beautiful song ever written. Perhaps, in the cold light of day, these cruise-shippy moments won’t feel quite so special, but boy is it nice to see crowds of people touching each other again.21:30 At the turn of the millennium, when his voice was still impeccable, David Bowie treated Somerset to a shameless greatest hits set where he reminisced about his early-morning set at the first Glasto in 1971. Bowie was incredibly uncomfortable about this performance being filmed, and so, at the time, viewers only got to see a few songs before the BBC cut to some pre-recorded scenes at the festival (including a bizarre segment where Billy Bragg took the then-Spectator editor Boris Johnson around the site). So this performance (airing on BBC Two at 9.30pm) has never been seen on telly in its entirety before – something to savour.23:00 Complete the annual tradition by calling your boss to say you think you’re coming down with something and you might need a couple of days’ bed rest. Now you’re free to lose yourself: OK, you’re not going to get invited into a yurt by someone called Cosmo to hear about how 5G is calcifying your pineal gland, but you can at least get Primal Scream on the iPlayer, scrape together the last of your shrapnel for a vegan energy ball and finish off any remaining supplies. Tomorrow it’s back to the grindstone, but let’s enjoy this one last night ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07de3d4e5a99b09873b75b434511ad1b87040e56/0_35_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61629db6887876ac34a49894fcd97ecc","title":"stranded at sea crew members trapped on cruise ships","story":" US reporter Erin McCormick describes why thousands of crew are still stranded on cruise ships after coronavirus bought the industry to a standstill in March. Will Lees describes how it took him 82 days to get back to Canada while Perry, who hasn’t had a salary since March, is still stuck and doesn’t know when he will get home to his family in Mauritius  US reporter Erin McCormick tells Rachel Humphreys why up to 80,000 crew are still stranded on cruise ships amid the coronavirus crisis. While most cruise ship passengers have now made it back to land, many crew workers are trapped, quarantined in tiny cabins, some without pay. Crew members have said the experience has taken its toll on their mental health. Cruise companies have blamed strict rules from health authorities for not letting crew disembark.  Rachel hears from Will Lees, a Canadian who last October took a job as an art director on board the Norwegian Star cruise ship. When coronavirus hit in March, he found himself unable to get off. Shuffled between ships to await repatriation, he was eventually taken to Italy, where he was finally able to fly home. Perry*, a Mauritian crew member, is still stuck on his boat. With two cases of coronavirus onboard, Perry and fellow crew have been confined to their cabins for months. He does not know when he will be allowed home and is worried about how his family, who depend on his salary to support themselves, are managing. He has not been paid a wage since March.  *Perry’s name has been changed.

Doctors and immunologists are ided about the causes of her condition, but that makes little difference to the trauma felt by the 42-year-old as the old economy starts to rev up again.“There is no way I want to go back to what was normal before,” she says. “I was very ill, but the lockdown has given me a break. I want those health improvements to stay.”Wiltshire’s hypersensitivity is extreme, but it highlights the challenge facing the country as it emerges from an acute illness, Covid-19, that can kill in weeks, to return to a chronic illness, pollution, that erodes our health over years but on a far more destructive scale.In the Midlands - where local NHS trusts have recorded some of the worst Covid-19 death tolls - there is both relief that the crisis may be easing but also nostalgia for the calm that some people got to experience by living and working at home, while the stress of capitalism was muted and there was a greater focus on collective wellbeing and community.As elsewhere across the country, this has revitalised debate on whether to continue the trade-off between health and wealth, or whether to push for a green recovery that addresses both problems at the same time along with tackling the climate crisis.In this region, more than anywhere else in the UK, that means rethinking the road and air traffic industries that have long been a mainstay of the economy but are also a rising source of health concerns.Until the lockdown, this West Midlands region registered several of the UK’s worst hotspots for pollution, most of which came from the exhaust pipes of the lorries and cars that zip by along the M5, M6 and M42 or crawl through the streets of Wolverhampton, Coventry and Birmingham. The street outside the Birmingham children’s hospital is among 10 areas in the city with levels of nitrogen dioxide that have risen above health guidelines in the past five years.These fumes - along with the small particles from diesel engines - worsen asthma and other respiratory diseases, particularly in children, the elderly and among BAME and low-income communities who often live in more densely populated urban areas. They are also a contributory factor in heart disease and cancer. Some studies suggest polluted air reduces the lifes of children born in Birmingham by up to seven months and may be a factor in the West Midland’s unwanted record as the worst place in the UK for infant mortality. Researchers are now examining whether poor air quality might also increase vulnerability to coronavirus.Drive along those motorways and through city underpasses today and it is clear traffic is creeping back. At the height of the lockdown in March, the number of cars on the roads dropped to 1950s levels. Now it is probably closer to the 1990s and rushing forward. People have more reason to travel. The talk of Birmingham this week was the reopening of Primark.Wiltshire has experienced a partial relapse but Birmingham, she says, could change for the better without cars. “You don’t need them here. This is the best city to cycle in. We have more trees than Paris and more miles of canals than Venice. If you cycle alongside, you feel safe, the air is cleaner and you might even see a kingfisher.”As in many cities around the world, councils are creating more cycle paths and pedestrian areas, but these are often temporary and not everyone is mobile enough to use them. The best short-term hope for sustained air-quality improvements would be for as many people as possible to continue to work from home.William Bloss, a professor of atmospheric science at Birmingham University, said the public had been given a demonstration that local-level action could make a big difference. “I think it has increased our appetite for change and society’s willingness to do things differently,” he said.Birmingham was already planning to introduce a clean air zone in January. The West Midlands is also pioneering a project to install 5G air quality and traffic sensors on 1,000 road junctions. The city’s cultural hub, Birmingham Open Media, wants to use this data with an augmented reality phone app, #SelfAir, so that young people can visualise concentrations of particulate matter around them in fun, creative ways. The director, Karen Newman, aims to team up with schools across the region in a citizen science project that would allow children to monitor their neighbourhood’s pollution levels. “We want them to collectively pitch back to authorities what they want them to do,” she said.But Bloss said the opposite was needed. “Encouraging a change in our vehicle fleets towards cleaner and electric vehicles could align with clean growth, air quality and public health, and reduced carbon emissions. It could also help levelling up efforts,” he said.The desperate need for an economic stimulus was evident in Bushbury, a former car manufacturing town in the Black Country. Even before the pandemic, this community, which has a high level of ethnic ersity, had some of the lowest income and highest debt levels in the UK. Now it is also one of the worst-affected areas for Covid-19 deaths in the country and is bracing for the financial impact on family budgets. Many people here were on zero-hours contracts in the care, security and retail sectors, which meant they were the first to be laid off.At the community centre, charity worker Kim Payne works with volunteers to prepare more than 100 food parcels that are now distributed weekly to residents.Over the past three months, the number of people seeking help at the community drop-in centre has tripled. This cosy hall, with its cafe and garden, was previously used for mental health counselling for teenagers and “feed your family on a fiver” cooking classes, but it has had to move activities online and start providing 300 food parcels a week plus 60 cooked meals for the elderly. Last week, for the first time, it launched an appeal for sanitary products after some local women said they could no longer afford period protection.“We know we’re going to be inundated,” Payne said. “All those extra people who have got in touch online over the past few months will continue to need support for months.”Clean air is little consolation for people here who have a week-to-week struggle to make ends meet. What is needed is employment and social security. Green growth could help.The Local Government Association estimates 194,000 new clean jobs will be created in the Midlands - mostly in low-emission vehicle manufacturing - as the UK moves towards its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. Leadership at a national level will be essential. Much is likely to depend on the economic recovery plan that Boris Johnson is expected to announce next month. The prime minister has indicated that green transport technology will be a key element. “The West Midlands was the home of the original automotive revolution, that’s where it all began, the internal combustion engine, and already in the West Midlands you’re seeing an incredible profusion of low carbon technology, low carbon vehicles,” he said earlier this month. The government has already put £108m into the the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre which is due to open in Coventry later this year but such sums are trifling compared to the mega investments that Chinese and US firms have poured into battery “gigafactories”. Brexit has not helped. Nor has the UK’s tardy 2040 target date to halt sales of diesel and petrol cars. There is also a lack of strong targets on electric vehicles in the environmental bill that has been held up in parliament as a result of the pandemic. And for those who have tried to imagine an alternative, technological fixes and investments will not work without addressing deeper causes within our political, social and economic systems.Roy Harrison, an air pollution expert at Birmingham University, said the opportunity could slip away. “If the public saw this as a real option, as a win win for improving the environment and stimulating the economy, we’d be a little healthier and leading the world in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.” But he was sceptical that the lockdown would provide enough political impetus for action. “I’ve heard it so many times in the past. Once everything turns to normal, they won’t care an iota,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34157c1abffce4de8b7935265d161aef2b073f94/0_77_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=29bb2e061f3fae2423934c7a8f349b8b","title":"uk seeking to scale back plans for independent satnav report says","story":"Ministers reportedly exploring alternatives to plan announced in 2018 to build rival to EU’s Galileo projectBritish ministers are seeking to scale back plans for a £5bn satellite navigation system that was introduced in 2018 as an alternative to the EU’s Galileo project, it has been reported.The ministers are exploring other options, which include using OneWeb, the UK satellite operator that went bankrupt in March, the Financial Times reported, citing sources.OneWeb has pledged to move its satellite production from Florida in the US to the UK if its management wins government support for its bid, according to the report.Plans for an independent satellite system were announced in 2018 by the then prime minister, Theresa May to ensure national security in the event that Britain were banned from equal access to the EU programme after Brexit.The satellite program was expected to potentially rival EU’s Galileo system, which is designed to compete with the US Global Positioning System (GPS), used for commercial, military and other critical applications such as guiding aircraft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ccee4ffefd8ac3fbd912af1609d49761ecb269/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acdc07575d5c9655e80c302bc12ce9c6","title":"why lockdown silence was golden for science","story":"From acoustic engineers in Britain to marine biologists in Canada, researchers made the most of the drastic drop in noise from human activityOne of the few upsides of lockdown was that, if a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square, you had a chance of hearing it. City dwellers across the globe delighted in the silence, the freedom from the incessant rumble of traffic, and the joy of birdsong. How cleaner the air seemed, and how splendid the blue skies without their usual grid of aeroplane contrails!Those memories might now be receding but for some scientists they were not just silver linings to a grim situation. The enforced experiment in which human activity was brought almost to a standstill created an opportunity to conduct studies that are normally impossible, in topics ranging from acoustics to atmospheric science to ecology. “We are being given an extraordinary experiment,” said climatologist Nicolas Bellouin of the University of Reading.The Quiet Project has been soliciting and archiving observations from members of the public. “We’re taking lots of technical measurements, but we’re also gathering a lot of soundscape data that reflect what people actually feel,” said Lindsay McIntyre, director of the consultancy company KSG Acoustics in Glasgow, who is one of the leaders of the project. “Everyone I speak to has got an opinion on how the changes in noise makes them feel.”Urban noise – from traffic, subways, sirens, and neighbours – is known to cause stress, but we don’t know so much about its true social costs. Yet it’s not just about the negative effects of shattered peace: for many people, the hum of life and entertainment is a positive part of the urban experience. “Some people are really missing the vibrant sounds of the city, which is perhaps linked to concerns about lack of work and earning,” says McIntyre.This acoustic information could be useful for planners – for example, for cost-benefit analyses of how designated “tranquil areas” in cities can be preserved from development, or to plan for potential changes in the future. It should help to make better predictions of what things would be like if all vehicles were electric, say – which is possible in 10 years’ time. “You could quantify what you’d get to acoustically,” said Dance, “and put a value on it – which is a factor in the economic costs of making that change.”Some of the noise created by human activities lies beyond the threshold of hearing, especially at very low frequencies of around a few oscillations per second (a few hertz or Hz). Vibrations like these are detectable using technologies attuned to seismic waves – trains and construction, for example, shake the ground at such frequencies.Usually the seismic effects of human activity are a mere distraction or nuisance for seismologists. “We think of anthropogenic noise as obscuring the natural signals from the planet that we’re interested in, be they earthquakes or other signals,” said earth scientist Zach Eilon of the University of California at Santa Barbara. So researchers tend to install seismometers far from sources of anthropogenic noise. But some stations are installed within cities, perhaps to monitor the earthquake threat – and these, Eilon said, are now supplying useful information about how human activity leaves a seismic trace. There is now an international effort, involving around 100 seismologists worldwide and coordinated by Thomas Lecocq of the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels, to collect lockdown data.Eilon said their studies so far, using seismic data from China and Italy, allow them to identify different noise sources from their seismic frequencies. Foot traffic and factories or businesses cause vibrations of 1-8Hz, traffic on motorways is around 10-30Hz, and trains around 20-30Hz. Purely from the seismic trace, it’s possible in normal times to identify working hours, lunchtimes, nightlife, holidays and big sporting events. Lecocq said that there are even some seismometers installed in schools that register pupils’ footsteps – and that fell silent while schools were locked down.“The really exciting thing about our research is what it can teach us about human behaviour,” said Eilon. “We have never had this sort of lockdown scenario where many countries and cities around the world are so drastically changing their societal patterns.” The changes in seismic noise that they have seen far outstrip the variation normally seen between weekends and weekdays, or even national holidays. By comparing these with data on mobility, changes in factory output, toll road use, and changes to train schedules, they can figure out how each societal activity creates seismic noise, so that in future seismic measurements can be used to measure what we’re doing.And because seismic data – unlike phone tracking, say – can’t identify iniduals, there are no problems about violations of privacy. Data like this could even be helpful for controlling the pandemic, for example by showing how well people are adhering to social distancing and travel restrictions.“Several locations in the US were already showing increases in seismic noise in early May as citizens became less compliant with lockdown,” said Eilon. He and his colleagues also saw differences between Italy and China, probably because public transport was not shut down in the former case.The findings are also revealing more about very low-level earthquake activity. The signals from small earthquakes are generally in the same frequency range as these human sources, said Eilon – so “that noise can prevent us from seeing below a certain threshold of earthquakes. Basically, we are probably missing a lot of the small earthquakes that we might otherwise detect because they are getting drowned out.” But these might become visible in the lockdown data. “This is exciting because it can tell us more about the state of stress and movement in the crust,” Eilon said.As well as the cities and the skies, another environment that became less noisy was the oceans, thanks to suspensions of shipping. Low-frequency noise from ships’ engines can travel over thousands of kilometres. “Most ocean basins have a persistent background hum generated by ships”, said David Barclay, an oceanographer at Dalhousie University in Canada.This noise can disrupt the communications of marine animals that rely on acoustic signals, such as whales and dolphins. “Fish, marine mammals and crustaceans use sound to hunt, forage, communicate, mate and navigate,” Barclay said. “High levels of sound can physically harm and kill marine animals, or cause permanent or temporary hearing loss, and can trigger behavioural responses like flight, stress and disruption of feeding.”He and his co-worker Dugald Thomson have studied how such noise changed during lockdown, both in the open ocean (in the north-east Pacific) and in an inland waterway in the Strait of Georgia outside the port of Vancouver. They saw a small drop in the weekly average noise at frequencies of about 100Hz in the open ocean, and a larger decrease in the strait. “We would like to understand which factors – ship traffic density, speed, tonnage, type of ship – are playing the biggest role,” Barclay says – information that could help to plan ocean transportation so it is less disruptive to marine life.“This is an opportunity for marine biologists to make observations under far-from-normal conditions – or that would have been normal 50 years ago,” he said. “I would say that every marine-related biologist or ecologist has at least one key research question that they can address during this period of relative pause.”An improvement in air quality was seen over many urban areas as pollution from traffic fell . While nitrogen dioxide levels plummeted, other changes in air quality were more modest, Bellouin said. Transport is just one source of small particles called aerosols, for example, and “other sources, like domestic heating or agricultural fertilisers, have not changed” – not to mention natural sources like wildfires and desert dust. But that’s useful, Bellouin said, because it allows these different contributions to be identified and measured.Aerosols have an impact on climate. They reflect sunlight back into space, can act as the seeds of droplet formation for clouds, and can increase the reflection from those clouds. Overall, they generally have a cooling influence – but some aerosols, like soot, warm the air by absorbing sunlight strongly. “The links between aerosols and the climate are many and complex,” said Samset. “They’re difficult to pin down and are still a source of major uncertainty when we try to project what will happen to the climate over the coming decades.”Usually it’s hard to disentangle the climate effects of aerosols from those due to rising emissions of greenhouse gases. But the lockdowns might have helped us do that. “What Covid-19 gives us is a rapid, short change in one of these influences,” said Samset. “Aerosols drop out of the air in a matter of days, so we should be able to see the effects if we look closely.Researchers are now planning to simulate the climate with and without the lockdown, to see if their models can match the observations. “This will help us improve our weather and climate models,” said Samset. “These lessons can then be applied to bigger questions of the overall influences of aerosols on climate and society.”These opportunities are not completely without precedent. The eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in 2010, for example, stopped air travel for a week, not only reducing aeroplane noise but also that from road traffic close to airports. And the 911 attacks in New York reduced international traffic by sea as well as air. Still, said Barclay, “It’s hard to imagine any other voluntary scenario where we would have the opportunity to study the marine habitat under these conditions.”“We’re all hoping that we can make the best of a bad situation and learn something useful,” said Samset."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d171faa11aa90283e5be8dc245d1eb81154d2303/0_68_3756_2254/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3b5105106fc1d582646e7d18f642cb4","title":"streams spinners and bubbles counties ponder all options for restart","story":"There are plenty of obstacles ahead but counties are optimistic about a return to action this summerWhen Vikram Solanki takes his first training session as the head coach of Surrey on Monday morning, he will be giving his players red balls to use. This was not an entirely straightforward decision since Solanki and all the other coaches around the country do not know how the county cricket schedule is going to look from August. “We’re hoping to know soon enough,” he says, “but at the start we decided we should go back to basics with a red ball.”There are no guarantees about this summer’s domestic cricket but most agree with Solanki when he says: “I would love there to be four-day cricket alongside an element of T20 cricket. I know there is a lot of work going on about that.” Richard Gould, the chief executive of Surrey, Tim Bostock of Durham, Rob Andrew of Sussex, and Lisa Pursehouse of Nottinghamshire have been charged with exploring every possibility. “That’s what the members would like and we will make every effort to play red-ball as well as white-ball cricket. Ideally, the games would have first-class status and they would be competitive.”Solanki is keen and “relatively optimistic” that the Willis Trophy, a much-touted proposal, should happen. “It has a great appeal,” he says. This would mean the counties being ided into three regional groups of six teams. Each would play five matches and the two counties with the most points at the top of their tables might then play off for the trophy in a five-day final, maybe at Lord’s at the end of September. It is a neat idea well-worth pursuing.Four rounds of matches could be played in August while the fifth could interrupt the T20 Blast, which is hoped to occupy most of September. Initially these games may have to be behind closed doors, although this restriction would enhance the commitment of the counties to streaming their matches. Surrey have invested in extra cameras to give their streamed coverage the feel of the normal television product. Other clubs, though nowhere near as well-endowed, might be eager to follow suit.Clearly there are obstacles ahead: the government and the medics will have to give approval and there may be logistical problems over accommodation, travel and creating secure bubbles.Playing the game may be the easiest part, although there has been the suggestion clubs should be wary of playing four matches in swift succession because of the burden placed on their fast bowlers. Such an argument should never be allowed to scupper the scheme. If the experts insist a bowler is at risk from too much cricket, just leave him out of the team rather than abort the plans for first-class cricket.It may be that the schedule will demand slow bowlers take up more of the burden, which could suit one of Solanki’s young players. One of the eight uncapped players in the England 30 is the 21-year-old off-spinner Amar Virdi. However, he is unlikely to make the Test squad so would welcome a rush of first-class cricket in August.Solanki is happy to share the promise of Virdi. “He has real skill that could set him apart and an ability to spin the ball and he’s a very attacking-minded type of bowler.”Doubts have been expressed about Virdi’s fitness levels but Solanki spies an improvement. “He’s getting to the point where he understands that in order to be a professional cricketer he needs to be an athlete. He’s responded extremely well to that and he’s probably one of the fitter lads in the squad now.”So if the pacemen are getting weary Virdi can bowl 25 overs per day throughout August. It would do him the world of good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3b256d3e22feb603a0ea7b6341596f40f7037bb/0_186_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ce11018460c39f82f6e304690861ad4","title":"royal ascot 2020 final day five st james palace stakes live","story":"We are going to miss Frankie Dettori so much when he hangs up his saddle. Let’s hope it’s not for a few years yet.A smaller field than usual lines up for the last Group One prize of the week, with much of the interest lying in the progressive Irish raider, Sceptical. Amazingly, this Godolphin cast-off was sold for just £2,800 in August. He has pace to burn but the last furlong could be a long one, depending on how much juice remains in the ground. One Master is being backed against him as people recall her excellent second on heavy in the Champions Sprint here in October. She has normally been seen over further and perhaps this will be too sharp for her but she got within two lengths of Advertise in the Maurice de Gheest last summer, on ground officially described as good. Hello Youmzain will presumably be on the front end, having made all in the Haydock Sprint Cup. He weakened in the Champions Sprint but the ground will be much less testing now. Khaadem, the Stewards’ Cup winner, hasn’t yet proved he belongs at this level but he’s still young. That is not true of The Tin Man, older than any winner for at least 50 years. Dream Of Dreams was beaten just a head by Blue Point in this a year ago but disappointed three times after that.I thought we couldn’t top the Thursday of Royal Ascot and Straarius in the Gold Cup but what a day already – the biggest-priced winner in Royal Ascot history and now a Frankie Dettori hat-trick!They’re off ... Royal Dornoch leads ... Wichita is pushed up to lead ...Pinatubo comes to challenge ... but is nabbed by Palace Pier ... and a hat-trick for Frankie Dettori!What to make of Pinatubo? He was undoubtedly magnificent last season, including on this very day a year back, but the Guineas seemed to show that others had caught up. The alternative explanation is that they just couldn’t get him fit enough at home because everything comes so easily to him, and the Guineas will have got him cherry ripe for this. Inserting a bend into the race ought to help him. Even so, it’s a surprise to see him taking over as favourite from Wichita, an impressive looker who has improved since last year. Arizona, the Coventry winner last year, is surely here to set the race up for Wichita with a strong pace and it may very well work. Palace Pier is the sexy, Gosden-trained improver and Lord knows those types need respect. Soft ground would have been a worry but it may be riding nearly good by this stage. Threat’s form seems to leave him short of this standard but Positive is a surprisingly big price at 20-1 in places, having beaten Kameko in the Solario. He needs to be forgiven a poor effort in the Dewhurst but this ground will not be as testing and his stable won a Group One on Friday.They’re off ... Run Wild leads with Cloak Of Spirits trying to close ... Cloak Of Spirits goes for home with Alpine Star just getting through on the inside to win from fast-finishing Sharing. Frankie Dettori winner again!!!Was it the tongue tie that dunnit? Quadrilateral was far too free in the Guineas, when that equipment was fitted for the first time, and didn’t drop the bit for the first half-mile. In the circumstances, staying on for third was a fair effort. She needs to settle this time and then find a turn of foot in the straight, which could be the tricky part for a filly who may need 10 furlongs at some stage. Alpine Star is an exciting prospect making her return to action, a half-sister to Alpha Centauri who had some classy fillies behind in the Debutante. She doesn’t want the ground to dry too much. It’s interesting that Oisin Murphy, who normally rides Run Wild, appears to have been let off to ride the US raider Sharing. A Breeders’ Cup winner, she looked to have held her form in a winning return four weeks ago. She and Quadrilateral are the only top-class winners in the field and the extra fortnight to recover since her last race gives her an edge.Journo Melissa Jones believes what we think is true ... that looks like the biggest-priced winner ever at Royal Ascot ...What a price for the winner of the Coventry Stakes! Nando Parrado is victorious for trainer Clive Cox at 150-1! Is that the biggest-priced winner in Royal Ascot history? Someone will tell us ...They’re off ... Thunder of Niagara is fast out with Creative Force ... Lauded travels well ... Nando Parrado has the lead ... and holds off the big gamble Qaader.Here’s the inevitable Frankie Dettori flying dismount after his victory in the Queen Mary Stakes ...Some race in prospect here ...Aidan O’Brien also has the favourite for this juvenile race and his record here is rather stronger than in the Queen Mary. He is, in fact, the leading trainer of all time with nine winners, including Arizona just last year. Admiral Nelson seeks to make it a nice, round 10 and he certainly seemed to have plenty of boot in scoring at the Curragh eight days ago. This is an extra furlong on deader ground at a stiffer track, so seeing out the finish may be a challenge and that’s where Qaader could prove a threat. Mark Johnston’s impressive specimen couldn’t keep a straight line but pulled nicely clear of his opposition at Newbury on the same afternoon as Admiral Nelson won and looks a real talent. Creative Force had things his own way at Newmarket and might need time and another furlong or two to show his best but the runner-up that day was third in the Norfolk on Friday, so there is some substance to the form. Dark Lion, who was fourth, will know a bit more this time and can close the gap. Talbot finished to good effect in scoring at Lingfield and this stiffer test ought to bring some improvement.Great stuff here with Wesley Ward, the American trainer of the winner of the Queen Mary ...They’re off ... Caroline Dale starts fast ... Sardinia Sunset is up there ... Sacred makes a move ... Campanelle takes the lead for America from Sacred and quickens up better to take the prize back to the States. That’s Frankie Dettori riding his fourth winner at the meeting. Prepare for another flying dismount!It’s slightly surprising that Aidan O’Brien has never won a Queen Mary but he has a great chance to change that with More Beautiful, who beat 15 rivals on her debut at Naas last week. She has a fine pedigree, as a half-sister to Saxon Warrior, but it wouldn’t necessarily point to five furlongs and perhaps something will do her for pace. Campanelle must be a contender on her zippy showing at Gulfstream and, unlike most of Wesley Ward’s, she has a European pedigree and so is not instantly vulnerable to a bit of mud. By contrast, William Haggas’s Sacred is a product of US breeding and could do with it drying if she’s to reproduce her strong-travelling Newmarket success, which promised much. Happy Romance showed the benefit of a previous outing when scoring easily over two rivals at Sandown last weekend and her trainer, Richard Hannon, will presumably be keen to land a race his father won five times.1 Chiefofchiefs (W Buick) 20-12 Burmese Waltz (D Tudhope) 22-13 Nahaarr (James Doyle) 4-14 Louie de Palma (A Kirby) 25-119 ranAlso: 7-2 Fav Blue MistNon Runners: 2,16,19,22Withdrawn: 1No 1 Swindler (9-2) was withdrawn not under orders.

Golden Apollo is there ... Nahaarr gets the lead ... Chiefofchiefs begins to get on top with the fast-finishing Burmese Waltz and takes the opener on the final day.I’m reading from details sent to me that the turnover is up hugely this week. “Royal Ascot has seen over £250m spent on bets, which is £100m more than what was wagered during the 2019 meeting, coupled with the restart of football which is set to bring in another £100-£150m”, said Alexander Kostin of americangambler.As far as today is concerned, Chris Cook tells me: Blue Mist, Nahaarr and Swindler have all come in for support in our opening race, Nahaar being 9-2 from 14-1 this morning. In the Diamond Jubilee, Speak In Colours (tipped by Pricewise) is a general 14s from 25-1 in a place but Sceptical is not weak and the 4-1 has gone. Run Wild, the supposedly sexy Gosden runner in the Coronation, has been allowed to drift to 13-2 from a top price of 5s this morning, while Quadrilateral looks strong at 9-4. Pinatubo has not lost his popularity, being down to 6-4 for the St James’s Palace, from a bit of 2-1 this morning. No one seems to want Threat, a 16-1 shot from 11s. A few are being backed in the Wokingham, including Jack’s Point, no bigger than 10s after being a general 18-1.Blue Mist - 41Nahaarr - 51Swindler - 132Aplomb - 71Embour - 141Louise De Palma - 181Brmese Waltz - 221Woves - 251Count DOrsay - 251Magical Wish - 331Huperfoucus - 331Total Committment - 331Dirty Rascal - 401Flavius Titus - 401Bar - 661 Full betting at OddscheckerIt hasn’t been a rewarding Ascot for William Haggas so far but he appears to have a strong contender in Aplomb, who has halved in price to 4-1 favourite for what we are told will be the one and only running of this race. Versatile as to ground, he progressed through his three-year-old season and just didn’t have the pace for five furlongs on his return. Nahaarr gives Haggas a fine second string and should also be the better for his first run back. Roger Charlton’s Blue Mist has his fans, despite having run into a good one at Newbury eight days ago. He ran well to be third of 23 behind Raising Sand here last summer.Swindler is a classy animal with more to offer, despite his reappearance flop, but he needs the ground to dry out. Count D’Orsay, whose yard won the opener on Friday, might find this stiff six a bit far. Dirty Rascal seems unjustly neglected at 33-1, having beaten all 17 rivals in a Glorious Goodwood handicap last summer. Big-field contests evidently suit, as he was second of 22 in a sales race at two. His final run of last year suggests he may still be ahead of his rating and his low-profile trainer has had winners since resumption.Crikey ... eight races today ... better get on with it ...We usually like to pepper the timeline with the famous going to the races on the racing live blogs – we’ll have to do with this today ...John Gosden 5 winsAidan O’Brien 4Roger Varian 4Alan King 2Mark Johnston 1Andrew Balding 1Charlie Hills 1William Muir 1Michael Bell 1Karl Burke 1Owen Burrows 1Paul \u0026amp Oliver Cole 1Clive Cox 1Tim Easterby 1Charlie Fellowes 1Richard Hannon 1William Knight 1In a week which has seen very few runners from other Irish stables, it is impressive that O’Brien has been able to have what, for him, is a normal Royal Ascot. With eight races to go, he has already matched the total he reached here two years ago and is only one shy of last year’s tally - and that’s without being able to field a single runner in the handicaps this time! Gosden seeks to become top trainer for just the second time, having done it with five winners in 2012. I fancy he’ll need at least one more winner from his four runners today, as O’Brien has two favourites among his seven runners and is well ahead in the tie-breaking category of runners-up.Top trainer best odds:4-6 O’Brien, 11-10 Gosden, 40-1 Varian.Jim Crowley 6 winsRyan Moore 4Frankie Dettori 3James Doyle 3Oisin Murphy 2Andrea Atzeni 1Silvestre de Sousa 1Martin Dwyer 1William Buick 1Ben Curtis 1Hollie Doyle 1Thore Hammer Hansen 1Adam Kirby 1Rossa Ryan 1Hayley Turner 1Fancied rides on Elarqam and Durston came to nothing for the high-flying Crowley on Friday but perhaps his job is done for the week. His big mistake has been to not finish second at any stage, so he’ll lose under the tie-breaking rules if anyone manages to match his winner’s total. His final four rides include Qaader, second-favourite in the Coventry. Moore has twice as many rides today, including the favourites for the Coventry and the Queen Mary, plus an obvious chance on Wichita. Dettori has five rides to come, including two fancied Irish raiders in Sceptical and Alpine Star. James Doyle isn’t out of this yet, as his seven rides include One Master, Sacred and Summerghand and there are also a couple of lively ones among Oisin Murphy’s eight bookings.Top jockey best odds:4-9 Crowley, 2-1 Moore, 20-1 Dettori, 50-1 Doyle.Now No4 in the last race, Imphal, has sent in his self-certificate. He’s not running either. Here are the latest details from the track. I like the idea of the self-certificate can imagine this week’s runaway winner Dandalla getting up and saying ‘I’m not doing that again today!’Going for the fifth and final day of Royal Ascot:Straight Course: GoodRound Course: Good to Soft, Good in placesStalls Straight Course: Centre. Round Course: InsideOur regular reader will know that only two racing scribes (one each from the Racing Post and the Press Association) are actually at the track this week owing to Covid-19 restrictions which means we might miss the big stories. Please forgive us.I’ve been so impressed by the determination of all involved with this Royal Ascot to make sure we are entertained. It shows, for example, in the inventiveness of ITV’s faux Zoom songs around the bandstand at the end of racing and also in the sheer number of races.It would not have occurred to me, if organising this hopefully one-off, behind closed doors Ascot, to add in a bunch of new handicaps and take the total number of races to a record 36 over the five days. Handicaps are, of course, a danger to anyone’s wallet and I can’t say the new ones have done me any good. But they also represent an opportunity and I still have hopes of today’s Silver Wokingham.Their addition must have been a good idea because I’ve enjoyed every race and I already have that dull feeling inside that comes from knowing it’s almost over and there is no Royal Ascot card to study for tomorrow. Or maybe it’s a heady mix of sleep deprivation and frustration at some of the outcomes ...Anyway, said Silver Wokingham will be along to lift our spirits in a matter of two hours or so. If you can’t bring yourself to have a punting interest, pretend you’re the commentator and try to learn the colours for these 24 sprint handicappers, most of whom haven’t been seen since last year. Or pretend you’re a tipster and try to guess what the going will turn out to be and where the jockeys will steer their horses, as a first step towards working out what might actually happen.It will be the first action on an enormous, unprecedented eight-race card at the Queen’s venue that includes the two top-class mile races for three-year-olds that are among my favourite races for the whole year. The St James’s Palace Stakes would normally be run on the Tuesday of Royal Ascot but has been held back this year to give the Guineas horses a few more days to recover, a decision rewarded by the renewed rivalry between Wichita and Pinatubo, the placed horses at Newmarket.In normal years, the Saturday card is not the most friendly for punters, in my view, being dominated by big-field sprints and the baffling enigma that is the Queen Alexandra. But today’s card has something for everyone who enjoys a bit of Flat racing, including the Coventry, with a thoroughly unexposed 16-runner field containing the next favourite for the 2,000 Guineas of 2021 somewhere in their midst.There has been no more rain since racing ended on Friday and, although there is a risk of showers, the going is expected to dry out slowly through the day. It is officially good on the straight course, while the round course remains good to soft with good places.Jim Crowley is back to try and add to the six winners of the best week of his racing life. Those hardened competitors Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori will prevent him from becoming top jockey here if they can.Enjoy it, be lucky and if you’re feeling deflated at the end of it all, remember that the virus-enforced compression of this season is here to help us the Derby will be along in just a fortnight!Many thanks to all who took part in our tipping competitions this week!

We’ve watched some fun archive streams from the companies Can’t Sit Still and M6, and loved the Little Angel’s I Want My Hat Back trilogy. But how do you capture the sense of occasion and that rowdy yet spellbound buzz that is particular to a young audience?Nottingham Playhouse’s virtual premiere of writer-director Jeff James’s Noah and the Peacock sets out a blueprint for making a live family show online in this period of limbo. It makes smart use of familiar technology, keeps the warmth and interaction essential to children’s theatre, and reframes a well-worn story with a message that will resonate with a young audience growing increasingly disorientated by school closures.The hour-long show takes place on Zoom – you book a ticket for a particular slot so it’s also been something to look forward to amid the monotony of lockdown life. While we’d probably be settling in front of the computer with a bag of crisps anyway, this time we’ve been instructed to do so – and to refrain from munching them. Other items we’ve been told to gather to create our own sound effects include a bottle of water, an electric toothbrush and a couple of cushions. Oh, and I’m wearing a cat mask, six-year-old Hilda is in her parrot cape and 10-year-old Aggie is dressed, only slightly reluctantly, as a rabbit.In the gallery view on Zoom we see a colourful assortment of bedrooms and living rooms, with audiences wearing animal onesies, face-paint and masks, which are downloadable from the theatre’s website (along with an activity pack). We are sorted into three different groups of animals – Aggie and I are “growlers”, Hilda is a “honker” – and it’s quickly apparent that making as much noise as possible is encouraged.Sporting an iridescent ruff, Kyle Soller is a riot as the pompous Peacock, getting giggles from both girls, though Aggie thinks his black-and-white jacket and pin-striped trousers are a bit Zebra-y. Peahen (Danusia Samal) is kind and curious but shy while Bradley Foster and Patricia Davenport play a supporting cast of creatures – and all four share the role of storyteller.Rosanna Vize’s design ensures continuity between the screens of the performers as each has a black-and-white backdrop showing a different view of the same landscape. The costumes are simple yet effective – shimmering earrings for Peahen, a paper beak for a stork – so they are fun for younger viewers but don’t seem babyish for older ones. (The show is designed for five-to-nine-year-olds.)As you may have guessed, a flood is coming and we all rattle our shakers and bottles on its arrival. Both Peahen and Peacock have lessons to learn before they can escape to safety with the help of three fastidious ducks. The story’s morals are delivered without heavy-handedness, as are the parallels between the cramped ark and our lockdown lives.Anyone who has had a meeting on Zoom will know how hard it is to get into the rhythm of a conversation – as spoofed in the three-way meeting in the BBC’s superb short dramas Staged. Even though Noah and the Peacock must have been a logistical headache for the cast and crew, there’s no sense of frantic paddling – you just enjoy the glide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7878ccd3e5ee78da883cbdb2bd65b74fe5925ef5/13_309_1864_1119/master/1864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7487d28d6c41038589cf776210c2651","title":"the best keyboard and mouse for working from home","story":"From the cheap and cheerful through to the classic or luxury, there’s something for everyoneWith many of us still stuck working at home because of the coronavirus crisis and some employers saying it could be months before they reopen offices, it is time to start seriously thinking about your home set-up and whether it could be more comfortable and efficient.

Was it the one that I followed across the hill behind Gabi Wagner’s house near Tromsø in northern Norway at midnight on a midsummer’s day?I had gone out for a walk. Another walk – because it is light all the time at that time in Troms County and there seems no reason not to be up and out in it as long as it lasts. And it lasts long. It lasts so long that lasting is not what it does. The light, plainly, is. Elsewhere, and at other times, days might be where we live, but for three months of the Arctic year there are no days, or rather there is just one long day, and everything lives in its light.My legs were tired when I came back from my walk at 3am, but otherwise I was awake. So was the male redstart that sang from a fir tree halfway across the bog on the hill. It did its work right away – they are my favourite birds and my most-needed every year of all the spring migrants to Europe. And because this day was so abundant with all its light – it stretched and everything in it stretched with it – I pictured the bird as my last redstart. Not because I felt death coming, but because I felt life continuing. There was no reason for the redstart to stop what it was doing. It could go on. It went on.That the redstart is my favourite bird part explains why spring is my favourite season. They go together. Common redstarts spend their non-breeding time south of the Sahara across the Sahel and through east Africa. In the early spring they leave the acacias and thorn-scrub of these places and fly north to breed throughout Europe.They are beautiful birds, giving off an extraordinary intrinsic glow, and I have never seen one that hasn’t warmed my day. Since they are good for life in this way, I like to see them as often as I can. In order to do that I have tried, through many years (I began birdwatching before I was seven), to find spring – the world’s morning – for as much of any year as might be possible, to stretch it out, to get it early and hold on to it late.That has meant looking for redstarts and other spring migrants before they have even set off north across the punishing Sahara – I’ve watched one fly between the legs of a camel in Chad and another dodging a prenuptial photoshoot in a hotel garden in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. It has meant zigzagging across Europe to catch newly arrived redstarts, in olive groves in southern Spain in March and in hawthorns on the south coast of England in April. It has meant listening to male redstarts sing for a mate in the fresh green oaks of an Exmoor combe in May, and hearing another do the same from a lime tree that leans over Chekhov’s writing hut on the shore of the Black Sea at Gurzuf in the Crimea. And it has meant, at last, tracking some of the most northern redstarts in Europe to above the Arctic Circle at the top of Norway, to Gabi’s bog, where spring is still beginning in the middle of the year.It was cold when I was in Tromsø, cold even for an Arctic June. I was wearing five layers, plus a hat and gloves, in order to drink my coffee sitting on a hammock slung between two birches at the back of Gabi’s house. A male pied flycatcher, not long arrived from some sweating equatorial African forest, had set up as temporary owner of the little wood. It sang on and on. Its little tune made tiny clouds in the wood. The cold didn’t seem to bother it. Yet its breeding life must be colder than its non-breeding life – the life when its partner hatches blind and naked chicks into frosty air, and the pair must find caterpillars for their begging mouths. There were swallows flying too, near Gabi’s barn, and willow warblers singing. All had come out of Africa ­–­ it was as it should be, but it was also extraordinary to see.Gabi is a chronobiologist. Time and time management are her concern, specifically relating to the ptarmigan. I put some of my unscientific fancies to her. Because it doesn’t get dark in Troms for about 100 days – the so-called 100 Growing Days – there seemed, to me, to be very little death abroad. There being no night means there is no sense of the dark as an end-stop to life there is no switch-off, no snuffing out.And yet there is something in the highest tide that speaks of its turning something in a zenith registers a nadir, knowing that what is now the nearest will become the furthest, knowing that light contains its opposite. That feeling is here as well as all the green growth. The migrant birds carry it with them. Light has been thrown up over the top of the world. It caps the time at the middle of the year, but on its far-flung travels we sense its opposite too so much light these days must mean, six months on, so much dark.Gabi suggested I go for another walk, but she did tell me that although the sun disappears and darkness reigns through the Tromsø winter, she and her three children actually enjoy more light in the year than almost anyone in Europe and that, thanks to the all-day light of May, June and July, the total energy of the sun arriving here is much higher than anywhere at the equator. The pied flycatchers, she said, knew that.“This is the basis of all the great migrations to here – the flycatcher, your redstarts, the swallows in the barn – that is why everything that can afford it comes here. There’s incredible growth, incredible biomass production, and that never stops during those months of 24-hour daylight. It is not very hot, but the light makes it worth flying from Cape Town.”With Gabi’s words in mind, I walked the next day for 10 hours up and down a mountain north-east of Tromsø. Of all the journeys and all the stakeouts I have attempted in my spring-seeking, all the way, indeed, from Cape Town to northern Norway, I think this walk said the most about its time and place, or rather, its times and its places.I began at sea-level, where a turbid black river jostled coldly into a fjord. The birches there were tall and their leaves were losing their salad-green shimmer. There were chiffchaffs and willow warblers, redpolls and redwings. The scene was domestic – the birds were paired up, working on family matters, some building nests and some already carrying food to their chicks.I started climbing. The leaves got younger with my every step they were shrinking back into the trees. There were willow catkins and birch buds – soft things furred to keep them warm. A willow warbler sang in a birch that was surrounded by snow. It had flown from Zambia, perhaps, to do that. The trees got smaller and thinned. I stopped at the last one. The willow warbler singing in it sounded nervous to me.That is nonsense, of course, but a few metres higher up I was walking through snow. A dead tangle of a woody plant had attracted a wintry caravan of redpolls – streaky brown finches with one rationed dot of red on each of their pilgrim foreheads. At the bottom of the mountain the same species were paired and breeding here that looked impossible. They gleaned and I shivered to watch. In my five-hour climb I had walked time back by six months.Ten minutes higher there was more snow on the ground and sleet in the air, but also, amazingly, a wheatear and then another – a pair, two hero migrants from Africa – walking about on the snow looking as sorted as ever, pulling everything, once more, towards the spring. Marvelling at their endurance, I glanced up and saw a bumblebee steering out over the ice like a furry helicopter.On the mountain plateau, I ate a sandwich sitting between a stunted willow and a bare birch. Does anything, I wondered, remember green here? The trees, perhaps? They were not dead. The summer solstice had passed, but their spring was yet to come. But it would, I said out loud, wouldn’t it?A willow warbler arrived to sing from the willow. There was green in its music. And then a male bluethroat started up: a rocky stream of cold-frothed song, but thawed and vital. As it sang, a red-spotted feather lifted in its blue-enamelled throat. It was like an Arctic flower, a crocus or a gentian: the flame in its blue throat held a heat within the shelter of itself, minuscule and yet warmer than all the ice in all the north.The trees where these birds sang were leafless, but the birds had come to them from Africa to be at home among them – as at home as they are wherever they are – and soon, if they hadn’t already, they would build nests and fill them with eggs. The willow warbler moved silently into the bare birch right next to where I sat. It said nothing now, but it was alive. That was plenty that was enough. I stood up to begin my return, and as I walked back down, towards all the greenery of Europe, the bird started singing once more.• Tim Dee’s latest book, Greenery: Journeys in Springtime, is out now (Jonathan Cape, £18.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9513dbaf1cff24d44b9a8e692e11e2fd7266e61e/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1f8f4a6186cb2bbd26fe32ba7d0c14c","title":"celebrity snoop dogs the four legged solution to making tv in a pandemic","story":"In Channel 4’s new series canine cinematographers show us round the homes of their famous owners. We sniff out a surefire lockdown hitWhen Channel 4 revealed its first slate of Covid-era commissions at the end of April, one new format sounded like a particular treat. Celebrity Snoop Dogs would invite viewers to guess the identity of a mystery celebrity by strapping a GoPro camera on their pet dog to sniff out clues in the family home. On paper, it seemed purpose-built to dethrone Alan Partridge’s Monkey Tennis as the pre-eminent TV pitch so absurd it might actually be genius.Exploiting shut-in celebs and outsourcing camera duties are certainly creative solutions to the knotty problem of programme-making during a pandemic. But there is a world of difference between coming up with a good title in a Zoom meeting and actually executing the idea. Someone has to try and make fetch happen. So it fell to Jamie Wightman – a veteran series producer and director of factual TV who has worked on everything from Don’t Tell the Bride to Shed of the Year – to deliver on the promise of that glorious premise in a rapid six-week timeframe.“There have been a lot of technical challenges,” Wightman admits down the line from his Surrey base. Foremost has been how to make a property show without production staff crossing the threshold. “First of all, we have to perform some sort of location reccy via video so we can determine where we want to put the cameras,” he says. “Then we have to coach the homeowner on how to position the cameras and rig the animals.” After delivering disinfected equipment to the subject, Wightman and his sensibly distanced skeleton crew monitor from an outside broadcast truck, hunkered down like an FBI surveillance team.While part of the fun will be audiences trying to guess the identity of the celeb as their doggo scampers round the master bedroom, Celebrity Snoop Dogs is not intended to be merely a Kennel Club spin on Through the Keyhole. Instead, the plan is to mix the ground-level doggy-cam material with the visuals of an upscale interiors show. “You would expect a presenter to take you round a property and look as if they are really absorbing the things that they are looking at,” says Wightman. “I was hoping we could mimic that with the dog, because we have these remote camera positions where you can see the dog walking around or looking out of the window. Watching the footage you think: what a clever little doggy, look at you taking us around this house!”In preparation, Wightman absorbed TV shows and films where non-CGI dogs were the stars – including Netflix’s recent Benji reboot – and consulted with Game of Thrones animal handler Kenny Gracey on how to get the best from his amateur hosts. “You can encourage a dog to take a journey from A to B to C if you let him know that there are tiny little treats in those places,” he says. “You run through it a few times and then you remove the treats, and they’ll still make the same journey. It gives the impression that you’re going on this lovely tour. That was a tip from Kenny, it’s how they did it on Game on Thrones.”So far the dogs have come in all shapes and sizes, ranging in age from four to 10, with varying energy levels to match: “Some of them just want to go to sleep in every room.” Halfway through filming, Wightman is loath to disclose any of the breeds featured, conscious that beloved pets feature so heavily on their owner’s social media channels that they might give the game away. “Some of our dogs have done lots of photoshoots, so I suspect that the owners could be deciphered through the pet, if people are familiar.” Anyone working with animals onscreen will be mindful of the notorious 1969 Blue Peter episode where Lulu the baby elephant relieved herself on live TV. Has Wightman had any similar accidents that might become TV gold? “So far, they’ve all been very well-behaved,” he says. “Food has disappeared from tabletops, shopping bags have been upended and clothes have been thrown around, but there have been no terrible messes.”It may have been conceived and fast-tracked because of the paused state of the world but Celebrity Snoop Dogs does not aspire to be lockdown TV with a capital “L”. Wightman hopes it is a strong enough concept to outlast the current crisis. “If it does the job, people will hopefully love it regardless of the fact that it was filmed under these restraints,” he says. For the initial run, filming has been limited to the UK, but surely there is a dream mystery guest for the show – a certain US hip-hop superstar whose French bulldog Juelz has their own Insta? “I would love to have had a nosey around Snoop Dogg’s house,” laughs Wightman. “Maybe next series.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818103781c2e32d74232af18fe26ab054fe5ba4/0_469_4210_2527/master/4210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6603b674045036cdf2421d3130fa564","title":"juneteenth celebrations us pictures photos","story":"Tens of thousands of people in the US marked the Juneteenth holiday on Friday, which commemorates the end of slavery.

But just a week after New Zealanders celebrated having rid the country of Covid-19 and the government lifted all restrictions on daily life except controls on entering the country, the one vulnerability in its defences – its borders – was dramatically laid bare.The failure to test returning travellers before they left quarantine, and reports of slipshod standards at the hotels where they are placed in government-managed isolation, threatened political fallout for Jacinda Ardern’s government, which was heralded worldwide for having flattened the Covid-19 infection curve with a swift, early lockdown of the country.“It’s incredibly unfortunate because that is what has been the cause of the government’s increase in their poll ratings, their competency confidence,” said Bryce Edwards, a political scholar at Victoria University in Wellington. “The public clearly thought that this government deserved support due to that competency and this is a major blow to that narrative.”The trouble started when health officials were forced to admit that two women who had arrived from the UK on 6 June had been allowed out of managed quarantine early on 13 June with a compassionate dispensation to visit a dying parent. They were not tested for the virus, but were were later found to be infected.With health officials’ permission, the pair drove 400 miles (650km) down the length of North Island to visit their family. Without the officials’ knowledge they had also met up with friends on the way.Suddenly, after 24 days of reporting no new cases of Covid-19, the country’s recovery was on shaky ground. Health officials had already said it was inevitable that new cases would arrive from abroad, but they promised measures stringent enough to intercept them.More stories of lax practices and failures to test at the quarantine hotels emerged. One facility had held a wedding in the same ballroom where isolating returnees had walked for exercise. Another had convened a children’s birthday party.Six people were released on compassionate grounds to attend a funeral and then absconded rather than returning to quarantine. Health officials told travellers tests were entirely voluntary, and the health ministry has not been able to provide figures for how many people were released from isolation without being tested.Ardern, who had “done a little dance” when New Zealand was declared free of the coronavirus a week earlier, was now stony-faced. The failings were unacceptable and the lack of testing nonsensical, she said.By Friday, New Zealanders were on edge again, and politicians, health officials and military leaders warned of jail time and fines for anyone breaching the quarantine rules for returning travellers. The military would audit the isolation facilities, Ardern said, and ensure the rules were enforced.Compassionate exemptions were also revoked. Two separate tests for those in quarantine hotels are now mandatory during their 14-day stay, and refusal to take a test will result in a further 14 days in isolation.New Zealanders, whom Ardern has referred to as a team of five million, prided themselves on their unity in adhering to earlier lockdown restrictions. The government imposed a national shutdown in late March when just over 200 people had been diagnosed with Covid-19. The country has reported fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and 22 deaths.New arrivals would have to “earn the right to join the team of 5 million by following the rules,” said Megan Woods, a government minister, on Friday. Only New Zealanders, their families and essential workers are currently permitted to enter the country.For some analysts, the government’s stern response to the breaches was still a positive. The prime minister had been “quick to acknowledge that protocols were not being followed consistently, and that procedures needed to be tightened urgently,” said Prof David Skegg, an emeritus professor in epidemiology at the University of Otago. “One factor in New Zealand’s success in eliminating Covid-19 has been the willingness of the government to respond quickly to mistakes and to listen to expert advice. I think this episode illustrates that again.”Officials announced on Thursday that New Zealand had reported another case of Covid-19, bringing its total to three. This time the traveller from Pakistan had been diagnosed at the quarantine hotel where he was staying, the way the system was supposed to work.Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health, appeared tired on Friday. This had clearly not been the week he had planned.The public has venerated Bloomfield for his handling of the crisis. His face has appeared on tea towels and memes, and a shrine to “Saint Ashley” was erected in a Wellington shop window. “Some commentators pointed out early on that to make him into a saint, which wasn’t any of his doing, really wasn’t good for the democratic method of being able to hold such a figure to account, and it might lead to a lack of scrutiny,” said Edwards. “I think that was the case and I don’t think he was scrutinised as much, but that’s clearly going to change now.”When he spoke to reporters on Friday, Bloomfield said the fiasco with the two women did not appear to have caused lasting damage to New Zealand’s coronavirus status.Hundreds of people had been considered close contacts of the infected pair, and officials had tested 6,273 people on Thursday, “much higher than we have been doing in recent weeks,” he said.He began his briefing with the sentence that had sounded so sweet to New Zealanders for 24 straight days: “Today the country had zero new cases of Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d126136c82ae146d18f23a79879d84724e95d79/0_223_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f08a6812b2ff84ddd9d2ea9be963435","title":"more followers than c of e religious stars of instagram","story":"From the priest who runs Spinning classes to the vegan preacher, how are they spreading the gospel on social media? Interviews by Deborah Linton In 2015, my friends invited me to do a slot called Rev Chris Reacts on their YouTube channels. I appeared in my dog-collar, reviewing food, culture and music one video of me watching Ariana Grande’s God Is A Woman has now racked up over 8m views. It hit me that I had an opportunity to inject some light and love into the internet. I joined Instagram five years ago, and my following has doubled over the past year. I have 168,000 followers – more than the Church of England and the archbishop of Canterbury combined.I’m the vicar at St Saviour’s Church, in Wendell Park, London. When I meet people, I try not to tell them what I do straight away, because it immediately shifts the mood. Sometimes they open up, sometimes they defend themselves, sometimes they suddenly just don’t like me.On Instagram I share all the things I love – sport, my family, God – but I don’t do “cut-and-paste church”: you won’t find long sermons from me. I’m married with two daughters, and have an identical twin, who is an army major. Last summer, I shared pictures of us cliff-jumping together in Dubrovnik and on a military trip to Korea.I get 50-100 DMs a day, scaling from, “Hey, you’re amazing” to pleas for help. Often those conversations inspire me to share some thoughts on difficult topics. Some Sundays, I post 60-second summaries of sermons on my way to church they’re being published in a book this autumn called The OMG Effect.My route into Christianity was not straightforward. At 21, I left my job in mortgages and property, and travelled to Tanzania, where I lived in a mission in the Maasai steppe. At 24, I was ordained as a deacon in the diocese of Mount Kilimanjaro. I returned to theological school in the UK, and have been at my current church for four years.The pandemic has forced the Church of England to embrace the technological revolution. Before, we were like fishermen with poor nets, trying to catch any online interest now a huge amount of effort has gone into tending the nets. Being locked out of our own churches has been especially hard. I started doing Instagram live services, and often got 5,000 people watching over a day, including atheists.I’ve had women send me naughty pictures. I generally scream, “Oh my God!” and ask my wife Jenny (@mamajennylee) to deal with them. I try to share messages that build up hope and love that make people feel heard. A friend says his Insta is full of boobs and bums, and then I pop up and it’s a breath of fresh air.My Instagram name translates as the Vegan Priest. I joined in 2012, and when I became vegan four years ago, started sharing foodie pictures. Some of the dishes, like the cakes I made, were popular and I started to narrow the focus to reflect the areas I am most passionate about: veganism, animal theology and climate change.I came to Christianity in my 20s and was ordained in 2018, after studying for 12 years. Before I became a priest, I worked as a massage therapist and taught modern dance and ballet. I’m a baritone saxophone player, too it’s important to me that people recognise that clergy are as multidimensional as anyone else.Recently, I have become more of an activist. In June last year, I met Greta Thunberg and posted a photo of us. Some posts are more personal selfies in my priest’s collar are always popular.I talk to a lot of young people who picture the church as conservative and boring. Then they see me and think differently. I’m a critical voice within my church as well: I want them to embrace veganism in a new way, to take action on that and climate change. When I write my sermons, I study the texts and theology, and think about what the congregation need to hear. But on Instagram, I’m more free. The responses are overwhelmingly positive, but there are trolls, too – mostly men – who tell me I’m not a real priest because I’m a woman. Sometimes I discuss it sometimes I don’t bother.I had been an emotional eater since childhood. My dad left when I was four, and died when I was 12. I was diagnosed with cancer just before I graduated from high school, so I’ve been through a lot. At my heaviest, I was 464lb (210kg) – morbidly obese.When I became a priest, I found it difficult to switch off. I was overeating and, in 2013, after 18 months in the job, I checked into a rehab centre and lost 100lb (45kg).I took my first Spin class in 2014. For 10 minutes it felt as if I was going to die, but I loved it. The music, the camaraderie – it felt like church.I moved to my current church in 2016. We’re an inner-city, multicultural parish serving a majority Hiic community. I found a dedicated Spin gym locally and was encouraged to qualify as an instructor. That’s when my Instagram account took off. A friend and I started our own community, @priestfit, for priests with an interest in fitness.There were a lot of haters, who presumed that was all I was doing, and had their own ideas of what a priest should be. So I started sharing more of myself, singing (I enjoy opera and karaoke: Journey’s Don’t Stop Believin’ is my song), as well as the church.A lot of my followers come from other Catholic countries such as the Philippines, Italy and South America priests are social media superstars there. There’s a clip of me on YouTube, from a documentary called Fathers Out Of Order, that has more than a million views.My full-time job is my parish. During the pandemic, like many churches we’ve livestreamed mass on Facebook. In one of our first public masses after lockdown, my cameraman was baptised and confirmed. That’s a beautiful fulfilment of the connections we’ve made during quarantine.Mine isn’t work you do for a salary or career progression your heart has to be in it. You become a servant, helping people with personal issues, taking calls at all hours. I’ve worked as a chaplain in a hospital, and for Merseyside police. Hospital work is traumatic. You’re with people at their most critical moments it’s intense and easy to burn out. Finding your own interests is essential.Being a chaplain means I carry out some of the duties of an imam, at the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque in Liverpool. I’m also married with four kids, so each week I try to find a window – a park, or the river – to get out of the city and be alone. I try to share these moments, so others can reflect, too.When I joined Instagram three years ago, my intention was to reach younger people. But it quickly became a platform to raise awareness for the work I do outside my community. In 2015, I responded to the refugee crisis by going to Calais. When I shared my plans on my Facebook page, I ended up taking more than £10,000 of donations with me. Support grew as I posted about work in Greece, Somalia, Iraq and now Yemen. I began to focus my Instagram on this humanitarian work, too. If I announced tomorrow that I was going to New Zealand or Japan, I can guarantee people on Instagram or Facebook would offer to meet or host me.Many orthodox circles frown upon new technologies. Even photographs were haram (forbidden) until not long ago. But I think if that’s where people are, we have to be there with them.During lockdown, I have experienced one of the busiest, most intense times of my life, especially during Ramadan. Each day, I found myself involved in up to five live talks on online platforms. Seeing the British Muslim community evolve and move online during this time was inspirational. It was refreshing to see people and institutions, who are often stuck in their traditions, try something new.I recently worked with the Muslim Influencer Network, offering pastoral care to singers and models with millions of followers. Some of them felt isolated by the gap between their social media personas and their real selves. It’s important to be conscious of those dangers.I’m happy and proud to be identified by my faith. But I also think it’s great to serve as an example of a religious figure who is just a normal guy.A typical week is nonstop: teaching and counselling congregants, preparing sermons, hospital visits and chaplaincy work, personal learning and then Shabbat. I passed my rabbinical examinations 15 years ago, but have been carrying out duties since my early 20s. My synagogue has 350 members, and I’m married with six kids, so finding half an hour for myself is rare. My Instagram account has become a big part of that.I got into whisky as a student. But what really got me interested was a visit to my brother-in-law in Glasgow, in 2005. He had all the special-occasion blue labels, but it was Bowmore 17 that won me over: peaty, sweet, flowery with a lasting taste. I started visiting distilleries. My wife is a chemical engineer and I’m a whisky buff, so there is something for both of us. We go on road trips with the kids and tick them off on a map. We’ve been to 55.On Facebook, I share messages or guidance, but when I joined Instagram, two years ago, I quickly decided it would be a whisky medium. I taught myself about hashtags and algorithms, and my images took on a style, photographing whisky against dramatic backdrops in nature: a river, a waterfall, the snow. I have a collection of 70 bottles and keep a couple in my car boot, or take minis if am travelling, so I can get pictures. To mark the Tour de France, I propped one in my bike’s water bottle holder for the World Cup, I balanced one on a football. My kids were mortified when I pulled one out of my backpack at Jodrell Bank.People must think I’m sloshed 24 hours a day, but my drinking is limited to small tastings. I’ve only been drunk once in my life – and never again. I’m in a group called Whisky Circle 17 of us message and share each other’s posts. That community of enthusiasts, from all walks of life, is lovely. We’ve picked up one another’s lingo, too. They’ve started saying “L’Chaim” (Hebrew for “cheers”).After the Manchester bombing, and during the pandemic, social media has been a way of quickly getting messages of hope to communities far beyond my own. Nothing beats human contact, but we can bring people from all over the world together on our screens, and this has been vital. We’ve had daily services, concerts, talks and conventions, such as bar mitzvahs, to keep people connected and uplifted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77fc5a20ba3f03dc5e9325123b24725ba6a787cd/0_158_4749_2850/master/4749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8214226a94771d44ac9bc1342c93e7e8","title":"coronavirus uk live review of englands 2 metre rule due in days and announcement on pubs coming next week latest updates","story":"Cross-party group asks government to set up a commission, as Rishi Sunak hints at relaxation of 2-metre distancing ruleAnother two deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours of people who tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland, taking the total there to 2,472.The statistics indicate that as of 9am on Saturday, 18,130 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 26 from 18,104 the previous day.Of those who have tested positive, 519 were in hospital on Friday night. A total of 14 patients were in intensive care with either confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a fall of five in 24 hours.There has been one further death of someone who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health to 545 - a toll that primarily focuses on fatalities within hospitals.There were no new confirmed cases of the virus announced on Saturday, leaving that tally standing at 4,866.The DHSC said 42,589 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Friday. That is a rise of 128 from 42,461 the day before.The government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 53,000.The DHSC also said in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Saturday, 230,550 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 1,295 positive results.Overall, a total of 7,714,201 tests have been carried out and 303,110 cases have been confirmed positive.The figure for the number of people tested has been “temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting” across all methods of testing.More than 500 people gathered at an anti-racism rally in Glasgow city centre despite being warned by police to stay away.Organisers said the Glasgow Says No to Racism event is aimed at “sending a positive anti-racist message from Glasgow’s George Square to the world on World Refugee Day”.Police horses and riot officers were used to control their arrival in the square and when the event ended around noon they were kettled before being moved through the city, controlled by police horses and scores of officers.NHS England said a further 71 people have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 28,292.

She told PA Media: This protest makes me feel hopeful but it also concerns me. We’re in a pandemic and I don’t want it to just be a hashtag and a trend. It is hopeful because people are finally listening but are they just listening because they have the time and they are bored? I want to see change, I want this to be followed through.Describing her own experience of racism growing up in London, she said:I’ve been asked what slave country I come from - in all seriousness - and I just think: how do I respond to that?Time for some joy.

The posts they filled were advertised as six-month placements but with the pandemic now coming under control, student nurses have now been told their contracts will be terminated in July, leaving them with no income.The Good Law Project petition asking the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to get funding reinstated until October so the student nurses can complete their practical training has now gained more than 92,000 signatures.Here is my colleague Ben Quinn’s article on the subject.One student nurse wrote on social media: Some of us left jobs for this.

Traditionally about 10,000 people gather at the monument in Wiltshire on or around 21 June, to watch the sun rise on the longest day of the year. This year’s celebrations were cancelled by English Heritage, which plans to stream the sunrise on social media instead. The organisation said it expects hundreds of thousands of people from around the world to tune in. Wiltshire police said officers would be in the area and local authorities warned people to stay away.Supt Phil Staynings said: “We fully support the decision by English Heritage not to allow managed open access to Stonehenge for this year’s summer solstice. “Officers will maintain a presence in the areas of both Stonehenge and Avebury in support of both English Heritage and the National Trust. “In addition, there will be a visible presence in local communities to reassure those who may be concerned.”The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has made an urgent intervention in the growing crisis over the welfare of 1,500 crew on five cruise liners which British port authorities detained after a raid on Friday.The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was detaining five of six ships it inspected on Friday morning over serious concerns about the welfare of the crew, some of whom have been stranded for three months in Essex.In a statement issued just before midnight, Shapps said the government would “not hesitate to continue to use every power within our control to safeguard the health and happiness” of the crew.The International Maritime Organization said the situation was on the verge of a humanitarian crisis. Some of the crew have been stuck on board for more than the legal limit of 11 months, unable to be repatriated to their home countries.The MCA sent investigators on board the six ships operated by British firm Cruise \u0026amp Maritime Voyages following reports of hunger strikes, late payment of wages and one death. More than 150 Indian crew members on one of the ships, the Astoria, have been stranded in Tilbury Docks in Essex for three months. They wrote to the Indian prime minister earlier this month to ask for help. One crew member died from “natural causes”, believed to have been a heart attack.Shapps said: “The welfare of seafarers is of the utmost importance and we take any reports of safety concerns around crew incredibly seriously.” A group of senior cross-party MPs from Labour, the SNP and the Green Party have written a letter to the government urging them to explore a four-day working week for the UK post Covid-19.The MPs, including the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, SNP MP Mhairi Black and Green MP Caroline Lucas, are urging the government to set up a commission to explore the options for a four-day week, a policy already being discussed in Scotland as part of its Post-Covid-19 Futures Commission.The letter argues that “shorter hours have been used throughout history as a way of responding to economic crises”.After the Great Depression in the 1930s, shorter working time was used as a way of reducing unemployment, which led to the normalisation of the eight-hour day and the 40-hour week.The letter goes on to say that “shorter hours should once again be seen as a powerful tool to recover from this crisis”. Work patterns have already been dramatically altered as a result of the pandemic and we believe the time is now right to explore putting a four-day, 30-hour working week (or any equivalent variation) front and centre – including protections for those on low incomes – as the country unites behind building back better out of this crisis.Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, has recently spoken about the four-day week as a key way in which New Zealand’s economy can recover from the crisis.Aidan Harper, from the 4 Day Week Campaign, said:Work has changed for ever as a result of this crisis and we want to make sure we have a better model of work emerging from it as we had going in.The benefits of a four-day week are boundless better mental health and wellbeing, work shared more equally across the economy, greater productivity at work, and the potential to engage in more environmentally sustainable behaviours. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said the review of the 2-metre rule, due out next week, will “make an enormous difference” to businesses, in a major hint it will be relaxed.In a visit to shops in North Yorkshire, he told reporters: The outcome of that review will be announced this week, obviously that’s something that will make an enormous difference, I think, to many businesses who are keen to see a change.He said progress made to stem the spread of coronavirus means the government can begin to “kick-start our economy” and that “starts with our high streets”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283772.1592594637!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ucd school of medicine disassociates itself from professor s views","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Dolores Cahill: “The views expressed by Prof Dolores Cahill are her own.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The school of medicine in University College Dublin (UCD) has disassociated itself from views expressed by a professor who told an online alt-right interviewer that she wanted to “debunk the narrative” surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.Prof Dolores Cahill, who chairs the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom Party, has been asked to resign as vice-chair of the scientific committee of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) because of her claims. The European Commission, which is a partner of the IMI, said the claims made by Prof Cahill in the interview could cause “significant harm” if taken literally.‘Propaganda tool’During the interview, since removed by Youtube, she claimed that lockdown and social distancing were not needed to stop the spread of the virus, and that “politicians and the media” were using the pandemic “as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people and to make them more sick and to force vaccinations on us”.More than 130 students, almost all from the UCD school of medicine, signed a letter saying the failure of the university to disavow Prof Cahill’s statements “acts as a silent endorsement”.A meeting to discuss the controversy was held on Thursday, after which the head of the school, Prof Michael Keane, told academic staff: “The school of medicine, college of health and agricultural sciences, the Conway Institute and the university, continue to fully support the public health position taken by the Irish Government concerning Covid-19.‘Spread of the virus’“This includes treatment for Covid-19 patients and societal restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.” Many UCD faculty staff and students are directly involved in the provision of healthcare and research specifically relating to Covid-19, Prof Keane pointed out. “The views expressed by Prof Dolores Cahill are her own. They do not reflect the position of the school, college, institute or university.”During Thursday’s meeting, those present discussed the academic freedom provisions in the Universities Act 1997.The view is understood to have been discussed that any move to disadvantage Prof Cahill would leave the university open to being sued.

Photograph: Ronan McGreevy Housing campaigners have urged the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) to recommend that future co-living schemes should not go ahead because of Covid-19. Campaigners and locals held a demonstration on Saturday outside the proposed Fumbally Lane development in Dublin’s Liberties which was given planning permission by Dublin City Council on March 30th. The plans by the London-based co-living company, The Collective, involve a 144 bed hotel, a 69 room co-living complex and an events space. That decision is now being appealed to An Bord Pleanala. Co-living involves residents sharing facilities such as kitchens, living rooms and leisure rooms. The petition, through Uplift, calls on the planning guidelines that allow for co-living to be immediately suspended until there is a greater understanding of the impact of infectious diseases such as Covid-19 on residents. People before Profit councillor Tina McVeigh said a community objection to the Fumbally Lane development will be lodged with An Bord Pleanala on Monday. “Planning permission for this development was granted at the start of the Pandemic. The irony of that isn’t lost on anybody,” Ms McVeigh said. “Accommodation that isn’t reasonable outside a global health pandemic we feel is even more unreasonable now. What we want in this area is real homes for people and an integrated and mixed community.” Among those attending the protest was local Sinn Fein TD Aengus Ó Snodaigh and Green Party councillor Michael Pidgeon. The draft programme for government involving Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green Party mandates local authorities to complete a housing demand assessment to avoid an “over-concentration of particular housing types” including build-to-rent, co-living and student sectors.However, it stops short of calling for an outright ban on co-living. Cllr Pidgeon said: “The Green Party has always been against co-living. We don’t think it is the sort of planning that we would like to see. “There is language in the programme for government around making planning more sustainable. This is exactly the sort of thing that should not be happening in a modern planning system.” Sinn Fein councillor Críona Ni Dhálaigh said all five local area councillors had objected to the Fumbally Lane development. She added: “As elected representatives we know there is huge public opposition to the concept of co-living and in this community, we have already had our fair share of transient accommodation.“We are urging An Bord Pleanala to listen to the voice of the community, the voices of professionals, the voices of public representatives and the many emerging voices in communities across the city who have opposed this kind of housing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Funding of €70 million to help the sports sector reopen was also approved by Ministers.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stressed the public must now take “personal responsibility” as the State-imposed restrictions were lifted. “This means not entering a place if you see it is packed. It means leaving somewhere, even if you are having a good time, if you have been there for too long. It means exercising judgment and self-control for your own sake, but also for the collective good”.Most music venues can open their doors, as well as bingo halls, arcades and amusement parks. Choirs and music practice can also resume, but with strict social distancing and ideally outdoors.Gatherings will be limited to 50 people indoors and 200 people outdoors until July 20th.This is later due to rise to 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors, although a further review will be carried out by the public-health team in the coming weeks.PreschoolsCreches, childminders and preschools will be opened only for children of essential workers, however this will expand to include all workers on a phased basis from late July. All other children’s activities and venues will be reopened from the end of the month.People will also be permitted to travel throughout the country, and travel to offshore islands can also resume. Those planning to travel to different counties will be asked to “acquaint themselves with the level of transmission of the virus in the relevant area”.There will be no specific number for gatherings in private homes but the public-health team has asked that physical distancing be maintained.Cocooning for those over 70 will continue to be recommended, the roadmap states.In its advice to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said “the risk of a large surge of infection remains ever present and Covid-19 will continue to be a threat to the world for the foreseeable future”.“As the public-health restrictions are lifted and there are no longer detailed rules in place imposed by the State, everybody in society will now exercise their own judgment and take personal responsibility for decisions that they make about the risk of infection to themselves and others in different situations.”The existing ban on rent increases and evictions has also been extended until July 20th following Cabinet approval.Minister for Health Simon Harris said that it was “unlikely” that there would be a return to the kind of restrictions previously put in place in March, while chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the NPHET would now begin to consider measures “at a national level, or below national level” should there be a spike in cases.“It won’t be the same set of measures that we introduced in March,” he said.Mr Holohan said he did not believe the measures were being lifted too quickly. “We think it is appropriate for where we think we are in terms of the transmission of the disease,” he said.Mr Harris also said the National Screening Service would outline its plans for the resumption of routine cancer screening by the end of the month but that programmes would likely reopen on a phased basis over the summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4284570.1592657949!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus limit of 50 in churches strange and disappointing diarmuid martin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSocial distancing signage in Dublin City Centre.

Within a week, she was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, known as “HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative”. The tumour was so small that it did not show up in an X-ray.When it was removed the following week, the surgeon suggested that Prof Janice Walshe, consultant oncologist at St Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin, be brought in on the conversation on whether chemotherapy would then be necessary.In the meantime, a second tiny lump was found and removed. They went ahead with the Oncotype test (a genetic test) by sending a sample to the US. The result was back within 10 days and Kavanagh says there was no long, stressful wait to find out whether she would need to have chemotherapy.She had a score of three out of 100, an indication there was no need for chemotherapy, and instead underwent four weeks of radiotherapy.“I have been absolutely fantastic since,” says Kavanagh, who is married with three children, and will be 70 in September.She believes she was blessed in getting over the rollercoaster of emotion so quickly rather than waiting to learn her fate.Sixteen years ago her sister Mary had to undergo chemotherapy, which was the standard course of treatment.“I don’t think cancer is the same terrifying word that it was then. The Oncotype test is a great way of speeding things up and is so accurate,” she says.Her cancer had a minimal impact on her quality of life. She lives in Terenure, Dublin, and believes being fit, doing yoga and walking often played their part. Her family are thrilled by the outcome and she has become a strong advocate for regular breast checks.Moreover, she says, her case highlights the merits of going to the doctor as soon as a lump is detected – when “a lot of people put it off”.No benefit from chemoOrlaith Cryan had breast cancer surgery in February 2013 having also been diagnosed node-negative (early stage breast cancer). She was referred to Prof Walshe, who recommended the Oncotype test. A tissue sample was sent to the US and her score “just scraped in” at less than 20.“She told me you can have chemo if you wish. She felt I would not benefit from it. I went on her advice,” Cryan says.Knowing the likely impacts including hair loss and having to go on steroids, she was very happy not to go down that route. Instead, she had hormone therapy for five years, taking tamoxifen – which blocks the female hormone oestrogen in the body. She has been off that drug since early last year.After surgery she had a short course of radiotherapy, with minor side-effects, while the tamoxifen had no side-effects.“I never lost my quality of life,” says Cryan (52), who is married with three adult children and lives in Knocklyon, Dublin.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has dismissed a suggestion from Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin there would be an opportunity to renegotiate the terms of government when the office of taoiseach changes hands.Ms Martin said on Friday that if the Greens entered government they would keep the commitments of the programme under constant review.“When the taoiseach changes, one way of doing that would be to renegotiate the programme for government and have a thorough assessment of what we have agreed,” she said on RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney show.As leader of Fine Gael, Mr Varadkar would be due, under proposed arrangements, to take over the role of taoiseach from Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin in December 2022.Last night he flatly contradicted Ms Martin’s suggestion: “There is something Catherine Martin said that I totally agree with. She said that parties entering into this coalition should do so with their eyes open and I would add to that that we should do so in good faith. “The programme for government has been negotiated by the three parties. It is for the full duration of the Dáil, there is no provision in it for a renegotiation clause.“Such clauses have existed in previous programmes for governments, and indeed existed in the confidence-and-supply agreement we had with Fianna Fáil. There is no such clause or provision in this programme for government,” he said.Election of taoiseachEarlier, Green leader Eamon Ryan said he expected a taoiseach to be elected by the Dáil on Saturday week, even if one of the three parties decided to reject the proposed coalition. “I imagine a taoiseach will be elected but it will be a very unstable situation,” he said. Mr Ryan, speaking on the  Inside Politics podcast, said he wanted to avoid a situation like that in the early 1980s. “Our political system could not make decisions. We had three elections in 18 months,” he said. “I will be honest, my first thoughts in terms of this programme for government is . . . to get jobs back and to get people working. They should be the first priority.”In another challenge to a Green Party assertion, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said that Dún Laoghaire TD Ossian Smyth was wrong when he said the M20 motorway to Cork would not go ahead during the lifetime of the next government. Mr Donohoe said the project would go ahead.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"China may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"time liberate economy pointless rules","story":"With the number of new cases of Covid-19 falling, more and more of the Government’s attention will turn to its strategy to get the economy moving. In so doing, it must balance the country’s economic, physical and mental welfare needs against the risk of a second wave of the virus. But striking this balance cannot be an excuse for contradictory or unworkable policies.It is welcome that airlines will be able to resume flights – albeit at reduced capacity – in July. British Airways has already announced 12,000 redundancies and its parent company, International Airlines Group, is burning some €200 million per week. But airlines have little hope of finding adequate demand to recover while the Government’s uniquely strict quarantine measures for international arrivals remain in place.We are told that plans for “air bridges” may mitigate the damaging effects of quarantine, and that the policy itself will be reviewed on the 29 June. But the Government needs to talk to the industry now so that it can properly prepare to resume flights before the summer ends. The decision to end quarantine then needs to be set out in detail quickly if travellers are to be able to make their summer plans.Equally, it is good news that some schools and shops have been able to reopen. But, once again, if the rules on social distancing are maintained such that those businesses cannot function, efforts to reinvigorate the economy will fail. Many pubs, restaurants and theatres require near-full capacity in order to be profitable, and will not stay afloat with the capacity that the current two-metre rule allows them.The two-metre rule is perhaps the most significant hurdle in ensuring that the economy can restart in a meaningful way. For schools to reopen fully, for the hospitality sector to function, for public transport to be practical and shops not to be paralysed by queues, it needs to be brought down quickly to a one-metre rule in line with WHO guidance. Such a reduction may not be straightforward. After months of effective messaging to “Stay Home”, many will feel anxious about a loosening of the regulations. Those people are at liberty to keep as far away from others as they wish. But in terms of making practical policy, we must ensure that we are dealing with real – and not perceived – risk.Of course, the risk of transmitting the virus increases at smaller distances. A paper published in the Lancet in June found that the risk of contracting Covid-19 at one metre is 2.6 per cent, and it falls to 1.3 per cent at two metres. But as SAGE’s Prof Robert Dingwall has said: “You’re moving from a tiny risk at two metres to a very small risk at one metre.”By the same token, we can have confidence that the risks inherent in fully reopening schools are small. The Northern Ireland Executive has announced that a one metre rule will apply in Northern Ireland’s schools when they return in August. Across the UK, only 0.01 per cent of coronavirus deaths have been people under 15. The death rate for 5-14-year-olds in England and Wales is one in 3.5 million. To give those figures some context, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents suggests that the risk of being struck by lightning in the UK each year is between one in 2.21 million and one in 1.1 million. As Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, who sits on SAGE, has said: “In school kids aged five to 14 it’s not only a tiny risk, it’s a tiny proportion of the normal risk.”This is a crucial point. A study focused on the risk of contracting coronavirus alone is bound to find that a greater distance means a lower risk. Viewed from this single vantage point, no scientist has anything to lose from being overly cautious. But such a view does not, of course, capture the full, multivariate nature of the problem which the Government faces.No policy will ever entirely eliminate risk and it is foolish to think that it could. Instead, the Government needs to balance the falling risks which Covid-19 presents against the cast-iron certainty of the catastrophic damage which the current rules on quarantine and social distancing entail – for cancer diagnoses, for domestic abuse sufferers, for mental health patients, for the swelling numbers of the unemployed, and for the economy.Reducing the two metre rule to one is an essential step towards recovery. I am glad that the Government is reviewing it, but it needs to understand the urgency of the situation for the many businesses whose operations absolutely depend on their summer activity to see them through the winter.It has been suggested that pubs and restaurants could be allowed to reopen on 4 July. But they need clarity now so that they can prepare, order stocks and supplies, and hire staff. If they are to have any chance of reopening at the start of next month, the Government needs to announce a one-metre rule now. If it does not, an enormous number of businesses who depend upon the summer trade will go under, and we will guarantee that this dreadful virus will wreak yet more misery in the months ahead.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/19/12/rebel-wilson.jpg","title":"alexandra burke x factor racism bleach skin afro","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘It breaks my heart,’ said singer in emotional Instagram videoAlexandra Burke has revealed she was told to bleach her skin after winning The X Factor in 2008.The singer spoke about how she has been mistreated by people in the music industry in a tearful, 15-minute Instagram video posted on Friday night (19 June), with the caption: “I felt it was time to speak up...

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Beer gardens in Scotland may remain closed “for a couple of weeks longer”, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has suggested amid dismay from pubs and punters alike that outdoor drinking was not introduced with other lockdown easing measures. Landlords had hoped to be able to relaunch outdoor spaces as part of Scotland’s second phase of reopening, which took effect yesterday and included measures allowing meetings of up to three households outside.However instead pubs were told they would have to keep their bars shuttered for at least another fortnight due to emerging evidence on how the coronavirus might spread between people.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn her daily briefing Ms Sturgeon has said she hopes to see people enjoying a drink in beer gardens before too long - but stood by her decision not to allow pubs to reopen in any form until 2 July at the earliest.Even outdoors, if you are in a noisy environment, maybe there\u0027s music playing. If people are having alcohol, maybe they\u0027re shouting more than normal she said, adding that investigations into “proactive steps” which could be taken were ongoing.

The UK remains one of the few nations that has stuck by guidance to keep people 2m apart from one another at all times - with many including  China, Denmark and France defaulting to the World Health Organization’s suggestion of 1m distancing.Emma McClarkin CEO of the Scottish Beer \u0026amp Pub Association said: “While the re-opening of outdoor space would provide some relief to parts of our sector, the vast majority of pubs will be looking towards the 15th July for the full re-opening. “Even then, there remains issues for our sector that need to be addressed to properly unlock the economic boost our pubs can contribute to the national economy.“Continuing to operate at a two metre social distance will make opening financially unviable for many and could result in over 23,600 job losses in our sector alone”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Followers of far-right commentator Katie Hopkins are showing their support after she was permanently banned from Twitter by tweeting I am Katie Hopkins.Dozens of them have posted the message to show their solidarity with the one-time The Apprentice contestant.The idea appears to be that of someone called – or at least calling themselves – Michael Barnbrook.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Do you remember the film Spartacus where everyone stood up and proclaimed ‘I am Spartacus’,” he asked. “Following twitter banning Katie Hopkins, all her disciples on twitter should now shout out ‘I am Katie Hopkins’. I’ll start it off ‘I am Katie Hopkins’.”A perusal of his timeline appears to confirm the tweet was not sent as a parody.Other supporters have taken up the call to arms and tweeted their support of a woman who once called refugees fleeing war “cockroaches”.“\u0027I am Katie Hopkins’,” said one. “I am unapologetic in saying so. Katie Hopkins is a much needed counter balance to the left. If it was not for intimidation by the left, more people would openly say so. My goodness me, a total ban? We are in trouble.”Ms Hopkins was permanently suspended from the social media platform on Friday for apparently violating its hateful conduct policy.She had more than a million followers.The social network did not say which of Ms Hopkins’ missives specifically had resulted in the ban.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Bianca Walkden during a training session at the National Taekwondo Centre in ManchesterFrench President Emmanuel Macron gestures about social distancing alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he arrives at Downing Street for a meeting.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Britain is set to sizzle in a tropical heatwave beginning this weekend — with the hottest day of the year predicted for the middle of next week.Temperatures will climb from Sunday onwards topping out at a possible 32C on Wednesday as winds blow in warm weather from southern Europe.And, after a turbulent past week that saw severe thunder storms across the north and snow in some parts of the West Midlands, the new bout of sunshine will start as early as Saturday for southern areas, forecasters say.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAndy Page, chief meteorologist with the Met Office, said: “Saturday will be brighter with many of us enjoying a dry day with warm sunshine and just a few isolated showers. A band of rain will move east across the UK during Saturday night, clearing Sunday morning.“Then it will be another bright day for most on Sunday with sunny spells and scattered showers, these turning heavy across Northern Ireland and Scotland.”‘Zombie fires’ return to Arctic, year after unprecedented blazesWhile the start of the week will remain unsettled across north-western Scotland, a warm and dry front will dominate almost everywhere else. Temperatures could rocket to 22C on Monday and 27C on Tuesday before peaking at 32C on Wednesday.Martin Young, deputy chief meteorologist with the Met Office, said: “By the middle of next week we’ll see temperatures across much of England and Wales widely climbing into the mid to high twenties Celsius and it will probably be hot in parts of southern and eastern England, as temperatures peak close to 30C.“It’s possible Northern Ireland and Scotland will join the rest of the country in seeing a spell of warmer weather later next week, as this hot air from the continent extends northwards across the UK.“We’re keeping a close eye on the possibility of severe thunderstorms developing later next week too, triggered by the warm continental air.”The hottest temperature so far this year was 28.9 degrees recorded in Scotland’s border region in May.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were used as a way of reducing unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s, which led to the normalisation of the eight-hour day and the 40-hour week.”The signatories, which also include trade unions, academics, and the former Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery, added: “A four-day week would bring multiple benefits to society, the environment, our democracy, and our economy (through increased productivity).“One of the biggest impacts would be better mental health and wellbeing across the board with more time available for socialising, family and community.”“Three-quarters of UK workers already supported a four-day working week before the coronavirus pandemic hit and millions of workers have now had a taste of working remotely and on different hours.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A review into the two-metre social distancing rule will conclude within the coming days, as a government scientific adviser claimed it is now a “reasonable political decision” to relax the measure and accelerate school openings.Boris Johnson, who commissioned the review earlier in June, hinted on Friday the government could alter the coronavirus advice to one metre – raising hopes in the hospitality sector after warnings many business will be unable to reopen under two-metre restrictions.Speaking to the BBC, the culture secretary Oliver Dowden said the government’s review will be “concluding shortly, within the coming days” and, crucially, ahead of the anticipated reopening of pubs, bars and restaurants and other businesses on 4 July.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe remarks come after the Joint Biosecurity Centre reduced the UK’s official Covid-19 alert level from four to three, signalling that transmission of the disease is no longer regarded as “high”. The move was jointly approved by the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Professor Calum Semple, one of the experts advising the government on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was now reasonable to start reopening businesses with other precautions in place.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“It’s my thinking in my professional opinion, rather than a Sage opinion, science is rarely clear cut,” he said. “Two metres is safer than one metre, but when the absolute numbers throughout the country are sustained and low that’s when people can afford to take the difficult decisions to start opening up society. He continued: “The reason that I changed my mind now, whereas I was of a very different opinion three weeks ago, is now that we are in a position where there are low levels and sustained low levels of transmission throughout the country.“I’m still saying that two metres is safer than one, but in my opinion it is now a reasonable political decision to relax these rules, perhaps accelerate school opening and start opening up other parts of the economy where it becomes harder to maintain the two-metre rule and where you might envisage going down to one metre with various caveats and other precautions.” Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the UKHospitality, which represents bars, nightclubs, coffee shops and leisure venues, also said it was quite evident the “science is not clear cut and straightforward” on the issue.Boris Johnson hints two-metre rule could be scrapped for schools“I think it’s really important that as well as looking at the public health debate we take into account the socioeconomic context: the impact on mental health and wellbeing for 2.8 million people in hospitality who are currently on furlough who don’t know whether they’ve got a job, don’t know when they can come back to work.”She also warned that around a quarter of our pubs and restaurants would be unable to ropen under the existing two-metre rule and moving to one metre was the difference “between viability and not being able to survive”.“At two metres those businesses will be operating at just 30 per cent of their normal revenues – well below break-even and we will see jobs considerably lost,” she said. “At one-metre social distancing they are operating at 70 per cent – they are at break-even, they are able to stand on their own two feet.” According to The Times, guidance drawn up by the hospitality sector and ministers will encourage pubgoers to order drinks using apps instead of going to the bar, as they are patrolled to ensure social distancing is maintained.Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The two-metre social-distancing rule could be relaxed for classes of up to 30 pupils to allow the return of “every child in every school” to lessons in September, Gavin Williamson has indicated.The education secretary suggested that the “protective bubbles” already used to permit 15 primary pupils to mingle without social distancing could be increased in size in the autumn so that all schools in England can reopen without the need for additional teachers and buildings. New guidance can be expected within two weeks, he said.And Boris Johnson himself gave a strong hint that the two-metre restriction – already set to be reduced to one metre in Northern Irish schools – is on its way out, telling reporters to “watch this space”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bullish plan comes despite a warning from the prime minister’s scientific advisory group last month that opening primary and secondary schools risks creating “significant transmission networks” for coronavirus.The experts cautioned that overconfidence about the effectiveness of the NHS Test and Trace system – designed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 by isolating the contacts of those known to be infected – could “quickly” lead to an increase in the crucial R rate of transmission to as high as 1.7, risking a loss of control over the spread of the disease.Teaching unions have warned that schools will be unable to reopen fully under the two-metre rule due to shortages of classroom space and staff.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Neither Mr Johnson nor Mr Williamson would give a firm commitment to a return to the classroom for all primary and secondary children in September, describing it only as their intention.And the education secretary dodged the question of whether he expected returning students to be offered a full school week.Visiting a school in Hertfordshire on Friday, Mr Johnson said: “We will be putting in further changes as the science allows.“I think that’s what the public also wants to see, they want to see us working with the reality.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailAmid growing pressure on the government following botched plans to return all primary school pupils to the classroom this month, the prime minister said it was “absolutely” his intention that children of all ages should be back on a five-day-a-week basis by the autumn.“Let me be very clear,” he said. “I want a world in which, as far as possible, provided we can make classrooms safe – and I think we can – I want every child, every pupil, every student, back in September. I’m sure we can get it done.”Speaking as the latest official figures recorded 173 new fatalities from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll to 42,461, Mr Johnson said the UK was “starting to make some real progress with test and trace, with treatments for the disease” and that he hoped people would be “much, much more confident” about sending their children to school by the autumn.With the government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre reducing the coronavirus alert level from 4 to 3 – signalling that transmission is no longer regarded as high or rising exponentially – Mr Johnson added: “We have to start thinking of a world in which we are less apprehensive about this disease.”However, minutes from a 21 May meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), released on Friday, showed that experts regard the full reopening of schools as a potential route to a second spike of infections in the UK.Sage advised that “opening both primary and secondary schools had the potential to recreate significant transmission networks, which would have a large effect on the epidemic”.The summer holidays gave an opportunity to “unwind” the effects of reopening, said the paper, which also noted that the relatively young age profile of most parents and teachers reduced the level of risk.But it added that opening schools would require “a significant effort to ensure that environments are appropriate to minimise transmission (for example distancing and hygiene measures and ventilation)” and said that more work was needed to assess the risk to grandparents.Stressing the importance for school reopening of a successful test, trace and isolate (TTI) programme, Sage warned that “overestimating the effectiveness of TTI capacity could lead quickly to R returning to 1.7”.Mr Johnson’s chief medical and scientific advisers have repeatedly stressed that coronavirus can only be brought under control if R is kept below one, with the risk of exponential growth if it rises above this level.Layla Moran, Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and leadership contender, said: “This stark warning shows that ministers must ensure the track and trace system is working properly so that our schools can reopen safely.“It is deeply worrying that one in four people who test positive for coronavirus are currently being missed under the scheme.“The government must clarify what action is being taken to fix these flaws and reassure parents, teachers and communities across the country.”Protective bubbles have been used in three primary-school year groups since the start of this month to allow up to 15 children to be taught together without social distancing, with each mini-class having the same teacher and working in the same space at all times, and contact with other groups kept to a minimum.But attempts to get more children back to school for a month’s learning before the summer break foundered on the practical difficulties of applying this to whole schools.Setting out his plans at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Williamson said: “We’ve been creating bubbles of children in the classroom, creating a protective environment for those children.“Currently that is at 15, what we would be looking at doing is expanding those bubbles to include the whole class.”Mr Williamson said the government wanted to bring “every child back, in every year group, in every school”. But when pressed, he did not confirm that this would mean a full five-day week for all pupils“We recognise there is still going to have to be protective measures put in place to make sure children are safe and make sure that teachers and all those who work in school are safe as well, and that is why we are going to be issuing further guidance in the next two weeks,” he added.The announcement came shortly after the Department for Education unveiled a £1bn “Covid catch-up plan” for personal tutoring and extra time in school for children at risk of falling behind because of missed lessons during lockdown.But the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton, said schools and colleges were trying to prepare for September amid an “information black hole” from the government.“Everybody wants to see all children back in schools full-time from September,” he said.“In order for this to happen, the current government guidelines would need to change because it would not be possible to do this while limiting class sizes to 15. You would need twice as many classrooms, and twice as many teachers.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is the highest total reported by the agency since its inception in 1950.More than 100 million people have been forced to flee their homes in the past decade, and while the 1990s saw around 1.5 million returning each year, that number has now fallen to 385,000.The continued lack of political will or the desire to explore long-term resolutions guarantees that the prospect of return for displaced people will remain low. The Syrian refugee crisis is now in its tenth year and displacement in Afghanistan is in its fifth decade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFilippo Grandi, the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees, explains to The Independent: “Public support for asylum has wavered in recent years. And in many cases communities that host refugees have felt overwhelmed or forgotten. But refugee flows are ‘crises’ only when we let them become so, by thinking short term, by failing to address them in a comprehensive manner and by neglecting the communities they arrive in.”Countries shouldering the burden of the displaced, unable to provide adequate housing or shelter, education or livelihood opportunities, must receive support while sustainable, long-term solutions can be found.“Refugees flee life-threatening situations, discrimination, persecution and danger. They are not the source of danger. Regrettably, in certain parts of the world, including Europe, the narrative around refugees and migration has been deliberately politicised in recent years with very negative consequences. Those who stir up public opinion against refugees and migrants have a responsibility in creating a climate of xenophobia that is very worrying.”Many refugees arriving in Europe who fled civil unrest or war in their country, possess a great ersity of skills and some are highly qualified professionals teachers, lawyers, dentists, engineers and doctors, many of whom have been working on the front line in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.Countries need to adopt a policy of inclusion. “Integrating refugees into our labour market is a major challenge. Everyone talks about how they want to help refugees but the process needs to be simplified,” explains Willem van der Schalk, managing director of German international freight forwarder A.Hartrodt. “Can we really blame refugees, political or economic, who are unable to provide for themselves or their families? No, we cannot. We have to change our mindset and start to see the potential of these people to our economy.

As long as you all abide by the strict social distancing rule laid out by the government.Before you start packing up your picnic baskets there does seem to be a slight roadblock.The National Trust, for example, has closed all its car parks as well as its parks and gardens, so until these types of restrictions change - people will have to wait a little longer before they are able to enjoy the nations new freedoms in full.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits. If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.THREE cheers for Marcus Rashford, a magnicent role model who yesterday won his campaign to make sure Britain’s poorest kids get one square meal a day over the summer. We know it will have been tough for the PM to swallow his pride and U-turn. But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense. So their instincts tell them to keep Britain in lockdown for as long as possible. But elected politicians know that  poverty and  mass unemployment kill just as surely as the virus. It’s time they showed some leadership and started easing restrictions in earnest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year. Incredible.The Government needs to get a grip of this right now, as I argued last week.Call the bluff of the horrible trade unions and get our kids back to school.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is unthinkable.Top children’s doctors say the closures are doing catastrophic damage. Boris Johnson has made clear he wants schools open. Where is Sir Keir Starmer Labour’s leader knows they are safe to reopen. He has sent his own children to school throughout lockdown. But he remains mute, in fear of his MPs and the unions. His panicky confusion when put on the spot by the PM was telling.Labour’s Twitter addicts love the social media term “gaslighting”, where someone deliberately confuses an opponent so that they question their own sanity. Starmer’s MPs are trying to do the same thing to the entire nation.They, along with Labour councils and unions, have been the chief obstructions to restarting schools, having whipped up fear among teachers and parents in defiance of the scientic advice. One day scaremongering, the next denouncing the Tories for betraying kids.The reality is that Boris should now bin the -pupil class size limit and the crazy two-metre distancing edict. There is minimal evidence to support either.Then he must order schools to reopen.The shutdown is wrecking children’s education every day it grinds on.IT is vital for our economy and sanity that we can take a holiday from early July.So we urge the PM: Thrash out a deal with President Macron today, allowing free travel with France with no quarantine. Rapidly make similar “air bridge” deals with Spain, Portugal and Greece.Better still, replace the crippling, job-destroying absurdity of quarantine — its rules are too slack to work, anyway — with temperature checks at airports.Then get our hotels and B’n’Bs open for a tsunami of “staycations”.Do it now, before summer is gone and a vast number of tourism jobs with it.IT was fantastic to have the Prem back last night.

Teachers will head back to schools for the original target date - August  - to get classrooms ready for students. The guidance has a day one focus that concentrates on social distancing and hygiene considerations within school settings, Mr Weir wrote. The letter said: The Northern Ireland Executive has agreed that the current social distancing guidance of m must continue to be followed between all adults within the education sector, but that a distance of m is safe and appropriate between children and young people.Using protective bubbles has been supported by the Department of Health and PHA, and flexing their use to m will allow full classes to attend.The m guidance between children is to be followed as far as possible within the confines of the physical capacity of each classroom and the m rule for staff adhered to fully.To facilitate these arrangements, schools will be opening in week commencing  August for preparation purposes, he said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this evening the Department for Education was looking at a relaxation for the rule in England. He said: We are working on what is needed to get all schools open in September.I do get the interaction between  metre rule and getting people back to school.But the  metre rule is itself a social distancing measure, so removing it has an impact in terms of the transmission of the disease. So we have to make sure in that review...the virus is under control enough to make the change and to replace the  metre rule,that is the conclusion, with something that makes it easier to do, for instance, getting people back to school.Northern Ireland has now dropped guidance for people who were shielding because the threat of becoming severely ill from the virus was so high. Health Minister Robin Swann said people should still be cautious when out and about and follow strict social distancing.The news comes as: Children in reception, year one and year six are currently back in schools in England, with all students expected to be back in classrooms by September.Boris Johnson announced a full review into the metre rule in England earlier this week, as hospitality industry leaders piled pressure on the PM to relax the rule. Downing Streets Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said the  metre rule can be relaxed in some circumstances. He said earlier this week: There are times in which this can be changed and that evidence of course can then be the basis of a policy decision on what the right distance is that should be mandated or put forward as the rule to follow. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Another £million will fund tutoring for the most disadvantaged children.Heads will decide how the money will be spent but No  wants it to go on the most “effective” interventions such as small group tutoring.It can also be used to hire private tutors or extra teachers.The PM has been under pressure to act after going back on a vow to get all primary pupils back to class for a month before summer.Instead, only children in nursery, reception and Years One and Six have ed. In secondaries, only Years Ten and  are guaranteed any time in class before summer.It comes after a report revealed .million kids had done little or no schoolwork at home in lockdown.Unveiling his Covid Catch Up Plan, Mr Johnson said the money would help head teachers provide “extra support to children who have fallen behind while out of school”.In a message to parents juggling work and home schooling, he said: “I am determined to do ­everything I can to get all children back in school from September, and we’ll bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible.”Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the cash would ensure that all children will get the education, opportunities and outcomes they deserve.He said the plan would be delivered over the next academic year and bring long-term reform to education that would protect a generation of children from the effects of the pandemic.He said: “We cannot afford for any of our children to lose out as a result of Covid-.“The scale of our response must match the scale of the challenge.”Professor Becky Francis, boss of the Education Endowment Foundation charity, welcomed the money.She said: “Tutoring is the catch-up approach supported by the strongest evidence we have.“This is a tremendous opportunity to offer bespoke support for disadvantaged pupils, and build a positive legacy from the present crisis.”Meanwhile, Northern Ireland said it hoped to get all pupils back by the start of September by halving social distancing.

The Foreign Office is also expected to relax its guidance against Brits making any non-essential travel abroad.An source told The : “The plan is to announce a small number of air bridges on June , though it won’t come into force until July .“Obviously it will depend on factors such as the scientic advice and the level of coronavirus infections at the time.June  is the date for the Governments first review of its controversial quarantine policy, which came into force last week.The Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed to Radio s Today programme yesterday that the government is close to introducing travel corridors with certain countries soon - meaning there would be no need for travellers to quarantine on arrival in the UK. Mr Hancock said: Thats the plan. The quarantine policy is important because there are some countries around the world where this virus is not under control, however, theres other countries where it may be safe to be able to not have a quarantine in place.So ahead of the formal review of the quarantine arrangements on the th of June, Im working with Grant Shapps on whether there are countries that have a low rate of infection where we can come to an agreement on a travel corridor.Travel between the UK and France will also be raised in a meeting between the two countries this week, Boris Johnson has said.The Prime Minister is believed to have talked with French president Emmanuel Macron about how people can move safely between the two countries when Mr Macron came to Britain yesterday.He also reiterated that air bridges, enabling holidaymakers to travel overseas without entering self-isolation when they , were being considered.It comes after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps indicated that the Government is actively working on introducing travel corridors, to help the struggling tourism industry.Speaking at Tuesdays Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said: Obviously I will be talking to Emmanuel Macron about all sorts of ways in which we can bring our countries together, making sure that eventually we will be able to travel freely to and from each others countries.The same goes obviously for Spain, as soon as we can.The reason for having the quarantine system is very simple - we dont want to re-import the disease just at the moment when weve really got it under control in this country.But were certainly looking at air bridges and ways to ensure that people can safely go on holiday eventually.Most international arrivals into the UK are required to go into self-isolation for  days, while in France, a two-week quarantine is currently in place for UK visitors.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Shapps told LBC radio: We wont be in a position to announce which countries - where reciprocal arrangements go in place - until the th.So dont expect anything this week, I think Im right in saying its only the end of next week.All passengers, bar a handful of exemptions, have to fill out an online locator form giving their contact and travel details, as well as the address of where they will isolate.Mr Shapps said the measure was introduced because we dont want to go back to kind of importingor Brits going abroad and bringing it back with them.A group of more than  travel and hospitality businesses campaigning against the policy said last week they had received private assurances from senior Government sources that travel corridors will be in place from June .Spain has warned that it may impose its own -day quarantine requirement for UK tourists.Foreign affairs minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told the BBCs Hardtalk programme: We will be checking what the UK will be doing and we will be in dialogue with the UK to see whether or not we should be introducing reciprocity as they have dferent measures than the rest of the EU.She added: The health situation ... is a little bit better in Spain than it is in the UK.This came after Spains prime minister Pedro Sanchez announced over the weekend that tourists from many European nations would be welcome from June .A number of other countries on the continent eased their border restrictions on Monday, but many have maintained entry restrictions for UK holidaymakers.Destinations that do not require UK holidaymakers to enter quarantine include Belgium, Portugal, Italy and Switzerland.Airline trade body the International Air Transport Association said rapid Covid- testing of passengers from countries considered as higher risk could remove the need for burdensome and intrusive measures such as quarantine.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For example, nuts are a great source of magnesium and vitamin E, an antioxidant that protects the body from damaging free radicals. These can cause oxidative tissue damage, triggering inflammation that contributes to problems like allergies and asthma.”Whether you like them chopped up in a salad or on top of a burger, turns out red onions are more than just a crunch addition to your dinner.Theyre rich in a chemical that can actually ward off a blocked nose and itchy eyes.“Eating foods rich in quercetin, a natural anti-histamine, such as capers, red onions and apples, can be helpful, according to Max.Also,you eat pineapple which contains bromelain, that helps the body absorb the quercetin.”Some of us may fear brown food, but lets face it, its much better for us than its white counterpart.Not only is it packed full of immunity boosting vitamins but you might even notice a dference with your weight too as theyre usually lower in fat.Max says: “Legumes, whole grains and tofu are high in zinc, which has an antibacterial and antiviral effect in the body and fosters immunity.Examples of legumes are lentils, chickpeas, peas, beans, soybeans, and peanuts, and whole grains include brown rice, oatmeal, barley, buckwheat, bulgur wheat and millet.”Good news, Vindaloo lovers - a super hot curry may help to blow those symptoms away.Capsicin, the stuff that gives chilies their heat, is known to help open up the nasal passages and relieve that bunged up feeling.But just make sure youve got a box of tissues to hand.“Spicy foods and horseradish can have natural decongestant effects, Max says.Use with caution though, as they may also irritate the throat, resulting in excess mucous and cough.”Instead of pouring a load of salt and pepper on your chips, why not go fancy and add rosemary.Not only will it look like something you might order in a posh burger bar, but the seasoning could actually help with hay fever symptoms.“Season your food with rosemary as it opens up the respiratory system, helping to reduce inflammation and encourages better breathing, according to Max.Okay, so we know tea doesnt count as a food but what you drink is definitely a part of your diet.So,you wake up each morning totally bunged up and reach for a coffee then you might want to reconsider.Max says: “Drinking hot tea with lemon and honey first thing in the morning activates movement of the hairs in the nose, which some people believe will prevent early morning sneezing with allergies or hay fever.“Drinking camomile tea can help as it has anti-inflammatory properties and contains azulene, a natural antihistamine.”“Nettle tea can also be beneficial. Stinging nettles are thought to be able to reduce the amount of histamine in the body and can help with unwanted symptoms such as a stuffy nose, itching eyes and sneezing.”He added: “Peppermint tea may help to ease a blocked nose.”. MushroomsWhether its chucking more in your next risotto or asking for extra on tonights pizza takeaway, consider the benefits of the humble mushroom.“Mushrooms contain higher levels of polysaccharides, which encourage the body to switch off the part of the immune system that reacts to antibodies and cause those unwanted hay fever symptoms, Max says.Reishi mushrooms,you can get hold of them, contain high levels of polysaccharides.”Its another simple one to increase in your diet - as long as you dont mind having a stinky breath.Max says: Fresh, raw garlic contains quercetin, a natural antihistamine. It’s also anti-catarrhal and contains vitamin C.”Some foods can actually make hay fever symptoms a lot worse... and its bad newsyoure a chocoholic.Max says: “Chocolate and alcohol contain histamine, the chemical that sets off allergy symptoms in your body. So whilst you might not want to give these up completely, reducing your intake might help.”He added: “Avoid dairy drinks which may encourage the body to produce mucus.Excess mucus is exactly what you don’t needyou suffer from hay fever. Instead, drink water, fruit tea, herb tea or any non-caffeinated tea.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The smaller the area being considered the greater the effect on the R value of a cluster. A small cluster of Covid- cases can lead to an apparent rise in R which does not give the true reflection of local risk. Today Sage experts warned the R rate does not tell us how quickly an epidemic is changing, pointing out that dferent diseases with the same R rate can result in epidemics that grow at dferent speeds.  For example,a disease has an R rate of  and infection lasts years, it will grow much more slowly than another disease with an R rate of  where infection lasts days.As a result, for the first time the Government, has published the coronavirus growth rates, for the UK, England and the regions.The growth rate reflects how quickly the number of infections are changing day-by-day.The Government said today: It is an approximation of the change of number of infections each day.If the growth rate is greater than zero , then the disease will grow.If the growth rate is less than zero then the disease will shrink.The currently growth rate for the UK as a whole is -% to -%, while in England it stands at -% to -% - indicating the epidemic is shrinking faster in the UK than in England.In all areas of the UK except London the growth rate is negative. In the capital it lies somewhere between -% to +. All other regions are below the crucial threshold of zero.A Sage spokesman said: Growth rates provide us with dferent information to R estimates, by informing us of the size and speed of change, whereas R value only gives us information on the direction of change.If the growth rate is greater than zero - or positive - the disease will grown. But below zero and negative, is a sign its shrinking.The growth rates in the regions are:UK: -% to -%England: -% to -%East of England: -% to -%London: -% to +%Midlands: -% to %North East and Yorkshire: -% to -%North West: -% to %South East: -% to -%South West: -% to %The R value and growth rate for the UK and England paint a hopeful picture of an epidemic that is heading in the right direction.It comes in a week where lockdown was eased further, with non-essential shops reopening their doors on Monday, and shoppers flocking to queue after three months away from the high street.Todays lowering of the Covid- alert level by the Joint Biosecurity Centre marks another positive step.The Governments chief medical officers, led by Prof Chris Whitty, say transmission of the bug is no longer high or rising exponentially.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.The move to Level  allows for the gradual relaxation of restrictions and social distancing measures - raising hopes the two-metre rule could be scrapped, a move which could breathe much-need le into businesses closed for months, and mark a move towards getting all kids back to school.A joint statement from the four CMOs, said: The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid- alert level should move from Level to Level  .There has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations, andthis continues.It does not mean that the pandemic is over.

British authorities say their Maddie probe is a missing persons’ inquiry.A former ambulance driver identied only as Dieter F, whose daughter Nicole knew Chrisitan B when he lived in Portugal, claimed at the weekend the Madeleine McCann suspect had boasted to him in early  he could transport “drugs and children” in his ft-long American-style van.He told the Mail on Sunday Chrisitan B said to him as he showed off the vehicle: “I can transport children, kids, in this space.“Drugs and children, you can transport them in this van, it’s a safe space in the van, nobody can find them. Nobody can catch you.”Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters has claimed federal copssent two letters but UK police failed to forward them to the McCanns.

That is something her devoted husband, Scott Mitchell, has been dreading.The couple married in  with some cynics snfily declaring it would never last, mainly because of the -year age gap, but Scott proved them all completely wrong.He adores his we and has put his le on hold, and his physical and mental health at risk, to take care of his Barbara.Scott has also helped to raise funds and awareness for dementia charities, even taking part in the London Marathon with a group of Barbara’s friends from EastEnders.It has been deeply sad to see how this disease has ravaged one of the most delightful women in showbiz.I always adored interviewing Barbara. She was sunny, funny, full of fascinating stories and always interested in everyone and everything.She would have a laugh with the crew, a cheery chat with our production team and was exactly the same whether the cameras were rolling or not.I know a lot of famous actors and entertainers who are grumpy gits until the red light goes on. Barbara was never like that. She is a consummate professional, but also a delightfully warm human being.I remember seeing her at an event in London, where she was swamped by photographers and members of the public. She’s so tiny I couldn’t actually see her in that large sea of people, but what I did observe was how everyone came away with an autograph or a selfie.Barbara is old school. She always said she owes her fame to the public and that they deserved a smile, a cheery wave and a quick photograph.That’s why she is so adored and why we are so very upset she is having to go through this anguish. Scott says her speech is growing worse and she now struggles to find the words to express herself.She ends up sitting shaking her head in sadness and frustration. Barbara is also getting up two or three times a night, becoming unsteady on her feet and falling over. Scott is worried sick that she will suffer a really serious injury.Sometimes Barbara looks at old photos of herself and asks, “Who is she ” and increasingly she doesn’t recognise Scott, which cuts him to his very heart and soul.This disease is so brutal, because it chips away at the sufferer, steals their memories and erodes what makes them unique. You gradually lose the person you love and have to mourn them while they are still alive. That’s why the work both Scott and Barbara have been doing is so vital.When she bravely told us she was ill two years ago, the Alzheimer’s Society saw visits to its website double and one-off donations to the charity rose by  per cent.She made a plea to the PM to help carers and sufferers, and to increase funding, and Barbara was one of the few people that made Boris Johnson stop waffling and actually listen.Dementia is a second epidemic within this pandemic, which is why we need more documentaries like the ones from Ross.There are , sufferers that we know about in the UK, and with us all living longer that number will carry on increasing.Relatives caring for those blighted by the disease can often feel alone and helpless. GPs and the NHS do their best, but it can be a lottery as to what expert care is available.As we have seen during this crisis, care home workers are an extraordinary group of people who treat their frail and elderly patients like a second family, but no one really wants to put a beloved parent or partner into a nursing home.There comes a time, however, when there is no other choice. Scott is now facing that prospect and it is tearing him apart. I also spoke this week to the musician Naughty Boy, whose mum Zahida suffers from dementia.He is a devoted son and lives with his mum to take care of her. Naughty Boy is backing Dementia UK’s Lives On Hold campaign, which focuses on carers and how draining it is for them, especially since lockdown. He wants to stress that there is help out there. I was touched at how he makes sure there is at least one thing every day for his mum to look forward to, to give her joy.He tries to see some light in the darkness and it’s also something Scott has always tried to do. He has to be Barbara’s memory and keep a hold of the love they have for one another.Eventhey have to be parted so she can go into a home, nothing can take that love away from him or anyone  going through the same sad experience.IF you are going to quote Game Of Thrones, then for the love of God at least get it right.Tone deaf Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed those who support the Black Lives Matter campaign by taking a knee, as seeming to “get the idea from Game Of Thrones”.This was not only hugely insulting, but Raab didn’t even bother to get the phraseology right. In Game Of Thrones, the characters are willing to die before they would BEND the knee in front of despots and royalty.In the real world it’s about expressing solidarity against racial inequality.Raab believes the heartfelt gesture is a “symbol of subjugation and subordination” and he would only do so for the Queen and his we. Those who take the knee, including footballers at theof the Premier League this week, and many protesters here and in the US, were astounded by his crass remarks.Following such wide­spread incredulity and anger, Raab has been furiously back-tracking. I do hope his Twitter clarication is genuine and not just another Government damage-limitation tactic.If this really was an episode of Game Of Thrones, he would have had his a*** handed to him by my favourite character, Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound.After that encounter, I guarantee he would never again be able to bend any part of his anatomy.HOLLYOAKS actor Adam Rickitt is an astonishingly candid and brave man. He not only spoke about his mental health at a time when it was considered career-destroying, but has talked frankly this week about being infertile.Adam suffers from an auto-immune disease that has made it impossible for him to ever father children. The -year-old has ankylosing spondylitis, which has had a devastating effect on his sperm count.While other men might have felt embarrassed about it, Adam has been refreshingly honest. He revealed the doctor told him most men have three million sperm, but he only had two. Not two million but TWO.He and his we Katy Fawcett, a top correspondent with Good Morning Britain, are very happy with their three dogs. Adam has been equally upfront about his mental health and suicidal thoughts. Since meeting Katy in  his le has turned around and, alongside acting jobs, he’s running a craft beer bar and shop. The couple call it their “baby”.They adore each other and are lucky to feel complete without kids.GWYNETH PALTROW’S latest attention- seeking wheeze is to bring out a candle that “smells of her orgasm”. This is a follow-up to last year’s model that bore the catchy title, “This candle smells of my vagina”.Not sure about you, but I have no wish to have my living room reeking of Gywn or anything to do with her sex le.I also cannot begin to imagine the sheer buttock-clenching embarrassment suffered by her two teenage kids.I think what her candles really smell of are pure unadulterated bulls**t.THE Oscars and Baftas have been delayed for a few months due to Covid-, so this could be a good time for the film industry to have a rethink about the whole business of award shows.Instead of a seemingly never-ending run of ceremonies, perhaps there should be a cull. In the US they could keep the Oscars for films, the Emmys for TV and the Tonys for theatre, and here the Baftas, NTAs and Oliviers.Then each event would be special, rather than a seemingly endless parade of bored-looking stars like Renee Zellweger, above, done up to the nines and wishing they were at home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The act is called Qurbani.In the period around Eid al-Adha, many Muslims travel to Mecca and the surrounding area in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.It is a public holiday in traditionally or majority Muslim countries like Indonesia or the United Arab Emirates, but it isnt in more historically Christian countries like the UK.In the UK the animal is slaughtered in a slaughterhouse, but in other countries it is often done as part of a public ritual.It is a time that is spent visiting family and friends, usually involving a big meal and some partying. Kids often get presents too.The meat is shared equally between family, friends and the poor and unlike Eid ul-Fitr, the meals made are predominantly savory. It is a time when they visit family and friends. Muslims will also give money to charity so that poor people can celebrate too.There are two Eids, which makes things a bit confusing for those not brought up in Islam.Firstly, Eid means feast, so theyre both family gatherings and a good excuse for a party.Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, this year in early June, to celebrate the end of fasting.Eid al-Fitr is often referred to as the sweet feast as Muslims will tend to put a greater emphasis on puddings and all the nice little treats they werent allowed during fasting.Eid al-Adha is the one thats coming up at the end of July and is the holier of the two feasts.It coincides with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is around two months after Eid al-Fitr.It is deemed the savoury or salty feast as there is a surplus of meat from the sacrice of the cattle that gets shared around everyone.Eid al-Adha sees the sacrices made as a symbolic act to mimic the near-sacrice of Ibrahimwho agreed to sacrice his son Ishmael when Allah God asked him to in repeated dreams.Ibrahim leads Ishmael to Mount Arafat, tied up his son and stuck a blindfold on so he wouldnt have to watch him suffer. The story goes that Allah replaced Ibrahim with a sheep as Ibrahim blindly flung the kne at his son. Other iations include an angel stepping in at the last moment and giving him a sheep or goat.This is the same story from the Old Testament of Abraham and Isaac.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite the best efforts of teachers and support staff, lockdown has had a huge impact on the education of millions of children and young people. This has put a huge strain on parents across Britain and it could well have a devastating impact on the wellbeing of many children. I do not underestimate how dficult it is to reopen schools safely in the current climate. But Prime Minister has simply not risen to the challenge. There has been no plan, no leadership and no willingness to find a way forward. Instead of taking responsibility, the Prime Minister has wasted time flailing around trying to blame others. He made commitments about the reopening of schools and he broke them. Unless the government accepts the mistakes it has made, there is a real risk that it will not meet its latest promise to get all children back in school safely in September. There are obvious things the Government should be doing. First, developing a coherent national plan to reopen our classrooms safely with those who know our schools best: parents, teachers, unions and local councils.

It comes after the UKaposs coronavirus alert level was reduced today for the first time since the start of the pandemic. A Government source told the Daily Mail that its scientic advisers are now totally comfortable with relaxing the two-metre rule, after the threat from Covid- was downgraded from level four to three. It is understood that scientists have given their approval to reduce the distance people need to stay apart to one metre,other precautions are taken. This is seen as crucialpubs and hospitality venues are able to reopen, with reports of social distancing patrols and apps being used to order drinks being part of measures to help them get up and running. This is likely to include more widespread use of face masks, screens and making sure buildings are ventilated. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here The measure is one of several that the PM is expected to announce over the next two weeks in an attempt to revive the economy andto a new normal. Earlier today, Mr Johnson said he wanted all children in England toto school on a five-dayss-a-week basis in September. Meanwhile, ministers are said to be negotiating holiday air bridges with  other countries to allow travel overseas, while the Welsh Government has announced it wants to restart tourism next month. A Whitehall source has also told the paper that two families could be allowed to visit each other at home as part of expanded support bubbles. Health officials are also preparing to write to more than two million people who are currently shielding due to health conditions, telling them they can soon venture outside to shop and enjoy leisure activities. It comes after the UKaposs four Chief Medical Officers for the four nations of the UK agreed to reduce the coronavirus threat level as the number of new infections continues to slow. The downgrading - recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre- means the Covid- epidemic is in general circulation, but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially. However, advisers have warned that localised outbreaks of Covid- are still likely to occur.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock boasted it is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus. Earlier today, the Prime Minister dropped his strongest hint yet that the two-metre social distancing rule could be dropped. On a visit to Bovingdon Primary School in Hertfordshire on Friday, he told the public to watch this space when askedthe measure could be relaxed to help schools in Englandin autumn. A Downing Street team is already running an urgent review of the two-metre rule, which is expected to conclude next week. The review could see the recommended distance between people in shops and outdoor spaces cut to a level seen in other European countries. It comes after warnings from the hospitality industry and MPs that thousands of pubs, restaurants and cafes would go bustforced to re-open while the two-metre rule is still in place.

Boris Johnson says he is very proud of his administration’s response despite the UK having one of the highest death tolls in the world, problems with test and trace, and the confusion on getting children back to school. In our second major audit, our Health Editor, Business Editor and Head of Politics give their verdicts and look at what the Government has got right and what it got wrong. Here are our verdicts... Lockdown What they got right: A consensus has now emerged thatthe Government had locked down earlier, it would have saved tens of thousands of lives.However, when lockdown came it was better managed than some European countries. Allowing an hour of daily exercise contributed to high levels of public compliance. What they got wrong: The UK’s top infection modeller, Prof Neil Ferguson told MPs half of all deaths could have been avoidedlockdown was called just a week earlier.With the Office for National Statistics now putting Covid--linked deaths at more than ,, that was a staggering conclusion. The decision now facing ministers is how soon and how much to ease lockdown. The ability of the economy to reopen depends on how strictly businesses are required to stick to social distancing rules and, for instance, whether they may be eased from keeping m apart to .m or m. Verdict: That Britain was one of the last countries in Europe to introduce lockdown will be a defining decision of the pandemic. PPE What they got right: Problems accessing suitable personal protective equipment have eased in recent weeks. Supply networks have been established but many healthcare organisations have been forced to source their own stocks.Problems remain, particularly in dentistry, due to the cost of PPE. What they got wrong: An independent committee advising on pandemic risk had recommended in  that PPE be stockpiled for the NHS – but it was ignored.The National Audit Office found central stocks supplied only % of gowns, % of goggles and % of aprons that models said would be needed under a “reasonable worst-case scenario”. Office for National Statistics data shows infection rates in hospitals and care homes are still stubbornly high compared to rates in the general public. Verdict: The NAO report makes a mockery of claims by Health Secretary Matt Hancock that Britain had enough PPE but was just struggling to get it to the right places. Care homes What they got right: The Government pledged £.billion to help local authorities respond to coronavirus. The bulk of the money was intended to help social care services.What they got wrong: Years of failed efforts to integrate NHS and social care hampered the response. Unlike the NHS, there was a lack of centralised data on infection rates ripping through many of the UK’s , independent care home providers early on. The NAO found , hospital patients were discharged to care homes without even being tested at the height of the outbreak. This came while Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed to have “thrown a protective ring” around care homes. Just % of PPE was sent to homes from central stocks compared with what modelling had said was needed. Care homes have lost thousands to Covid-, leaving many independent providers on the verge of going bust. Verdict: Reform of a system on the brink is vital but residents and families fear things will get worse before they get better. Furlough What they got right: The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme launched by Chancellor Rishi Sunak was the Government’s biggest weapon in the face of the crisis.More than nine million workers are having % of wages covered by the state. The scheme prevented massive job losses but at huge cost to the taxpayer – almost £billlion and growing. What they got wrong: Early issues included the cut-off for when new employees were eligible, which was extended. There have also been concerns about possible fraudulent applications.But the biggest concern is the months ahead. The scheme will be wound down from the end of July, when employers will be expected to pay gradually more – sparking fears of staff being axed. The scheme ends on October , which could result in even more redundancies in sectors still suffering. Verdict: The scheme prevented a tsunami of job losses. But wave upon wave of redundancies have already been announced and expect more jobs misery to come. Quarantine What they got right: It’s hard to know at this stage, given the onslaught of criticism. Most people arriving in the UK from June  have had to self-isolate for  days.Home Secretary Priti Patel claimed scientic advice showed introducing the measure sooner would have made “little dference” to the spread of Covid- but that the UK was now “more vulnerable” to infections coming from abroad. What they got wrong: Convincing the public, airlines and other businesses it was the right thing to do.It is claimed the quarantining rule is costing the economy £million a week. Britain’s three biggest airlines – British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair – are seeking an urgent judicial review, saying the policy is having a devastating effect. The Government is due to look at the policy again on June . Verdict: Any scientic evidence that quarantining was the right move has been eclipsed by the shambolic way in which the scheme has been introduced. BAME deaths What they got right: Public Health England was commissioned to look at the impact of Covid on minority groups. It found Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more likely to die.People of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of white British. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicity had between % and % higher risk. A separate report by the Office for National Statistics found people in poorer areas were more likely to die from Covid. The most deprived areas of England and Wales have . deaths per , people, compared with . in affluent areas. What they got wrong: Boris Johnson has appointed Minister for Equalities Kemi Badenoch to review the impact of Covid on the Black and Asian communities.But the Government has not said when it will be published or what action it will take to protect those most at risk, including BAME workers in the health and care sectors. Verdict: Not enough action to protect minorities and poorest. Test and Trace What they got right: Contact tracing was rolled out suspiciously early amid a political storm around the lockdown breach by aide Dominic Cummings.Despite this speed, the UK is already carrying out more tests than in most comparable countries due to our high infection rates. NHS Test and Trace has yet to reveal how quickly people are being traced, which is key to preventing a second wave. What they got wrong: Data from the first fortnight shows a quarter who order a test cannot be contacted or refuse to give friends’ details.Contact tracers were meant to be helped by an NHS app, promised by mid-May but scrapped after a troubled trial.The Health Secretary will now look at an app by Apple and Google which will not allow the NHS to access data to identy local outbreaks. Any app will be ready by winter at best.The statistics watchdog also rapped “inadequate” testing figures. Verdict: The performance of the call-centre contact tracing system is improving but time will tellit is enough. Schools What they got right: Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has finally announced a £billion package to help pupils in England catch up.This will cover tutoring for disadvantaged kids and one-to-one or group tuition for primary and secondary pupils. It works out as just six hours of extra teaching per child, despite many having lost six months of school time. Nor does it include help for sixth-formers. What they got wrong: There is still no national plan for getting pupils in England back to school. The Government had wanted all primaries to reopen for all kids before the summer holidays.They had to ditch this goal when teachers and unions pointed out it was impractical under social distancing rules. It is not certain that all schools will be able to reopen in Septemberthey have to split pupils into -strong “bubbles”. This may require more staff and using other public buildings as temporary classes. Verdict: The absence of a clear plan has left parents and teachers confused.Vulnerable What they got right: Councils got support to provide accommodation for people living on the streets. After pressure from opposition MPs, the Home Office found £milllion to support victims of domestic abuse during the pandemic. But the Government has yet to commit to long-term funding to help rough sleepers. Labour says just £.m of the £m to help domestic abuse victims has reached the front line. What they got wrong: It took a campaign by Man Utd star Marcus Rashford for the Government to agree to extend free school meals for the summer holiday. The PM also U-turned on measures forcing overseas NHS workers to pay for their own treatment. New claimants for Universal Credit are still having to wait five weeks for the first payment and demand for foodbank support has risen by % since the lockdown.Verdict: The Government has a blind spot when it comes to helping the disadvantaged.Overall What they got right: When the outbreak struck, the Government basked in a lot of public goodwill as the country came together. The rapid building of the Nightingale hospitals was a huge collective effort.Chancellor Rishi Sunak also won plaudits for the smooth rollout of the furlough scheme. There was also praise for the clear communications from the Government which led to millions of people abiding by the message to “stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives”.

A combination of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, toxic infighting and an unpopular stance on Brexit all contributed to Labour’s worst showing for more than  years. The review also notes victory at the next election is far from guaranteed, saying hoping Brexit will go away and having a new leader will not automatically reverse fortunes. To win a majority next time needs a swing greater than Tony Blair managed in . It requires winning back seats from the SNP in Scotland and those lost to the Tories in the Midlands and north of England. While Labour stacked up votes in big cities, it has lost voters in towns and coastal resorts. No wonder the report concludes there is a mountain to climb. But there are also reasons for optimism. Keir Starmer has made an excellent start as leader. He has taken the fight to Boris Johnson, appointed a talented Shadow Cabinet and started to heal some of the party’s isions. Labour needs to build on this early success by developing an attractive policy agenda.

A lot of it came after he spoke in support of Black Lives Matter and is sickening reading.  Nobody would tolerate this vile languagethey heard it in a shop or a pub.

His portentous, I-am-serious-me statement did not add so I can f*** it right up at the end, but it might as well have done.As Britain emerges from lockdown and , excess deaths, mostly due to the virus getting a bit tired rather than any brilliance on the governmentaposs part, blame is being bundled up in preparation for the Prime Ministerial reshuffle which will send it as far away as possible.One of the recipients will be the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, whose response to a health pandemic has been to destroy the health and social care of as many people as possible, with a level of incompetence that is close to brilliantly awful.  At the start of April, Apple and Google joined forces to use smartphones to trace coronavirus outbreaks. Within days, journalists were briefed the NHS was developing its own version, available in weeks, to ease lockdown. The fact UK local authorities had public health officials trained in tracing disease outbreaks was barely mentioned.On April , Halfcocked announced: Today I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing [...] We’re already testing this app and as we do this we’re working closely with the world’s leading tech companies and renowned experts in digital safety and ethics.”On April  it was reported Apple had refused to downgrade its privacy rules, which the NHS app needed to work.On April  Halfcocked said the app was crucial and would be rolled out in a matter of weeks. On April , a parliamentary committee was told it would be ready in a fortnight, and the Apple Google version of a tracing app had been rejected as it would slow us down quite considerably. All tracing apps rely on bluetooth connections between phones, but they store data dferently. The UK insisted all contacts be uploaded automatically onto a central server, regardless of health status Apple and Google kept data offline on your phone, pinging warnings out to anonymised contacts only when an infection is confirmed. The international version would also be built into operating systems, putting it on billions of phones worldwide, rather than relying on people specically downloading it.Most of the world went with Apple and Google. In Europe, only Britain and France insisted on a homebrew. On April  Germany switched sides, announcing a national app would not run on iPhones unless the screens were unlocked and the app running.Halfcocked doubled down. By then contracts had been signed with a bunch of private companies to provide software engineers, data processing centres, and servers.On April , the government announced the app would be tested on the Isle of Wight. Hancock said it was islandersapos civic duty to download it. On May , the Health Service Journal reported claims it was not fit for inclusion in the NHSapos own app library, had not passed basic cybersecurity tests, and was “wobbly”. On May , barristers warned the government might be sued over privacy and data protection concerns, and cyber experts said it was open to trolling, and foreign spies shutting down entire cities with fake reports.The same day, Halfcocked said the app was a very, very positive step in terms of us all being able to get some of our liberty back”. It was reported, again, the app wouldnapost work on locked iPhones, and would make safe international travel impossible.On May , Isle of Wight users said it didnapost work on older iPhones, Australia announced it was going with Apple Google after its own app didnapost work well enough, and the government had given £.m to a Swiss firm to seeit could somehow blend the Apple technology with the British app.On May , it was revealed the NHSX app was being rebuilt. On May , the government said it was not. Experts, again, said they were worried the NHSX version relied on self-reporting, rather than a diagnostic test, leaving it open to trolls and abuse. On May , NHSX finally admitted the app didnapost work on older phones. On May , MPs heard the UK app would not work with the Irish version, so any cross-border infections in Northern Ireland would not be picked up.Yet on May , Halfcocked boasted to Parliament: We now have the elements we need to roll out our national Test  Trace service – the testing capacity, the tracing capability and the technology. It was announced, again, the app would be rolled out within weeks.  Apple and Google launched their app - the one that would slow us down - on May . Four days later, the Department of Health gave £million to local authorities so their public health experts could help with tracking and tracing.On May , the Mirror revealed the PMaposs chief adviser had broken lockdown rules while infectious. On May , we revealed heaposd done so twice. On May , Halfcocked set , human contract tracers to work before the app was ready, and said he was getting people used to the idea. A DoH announcement said it would be complemented by the app in coming weeks. On May , he bent maths to announce heaposd hit his target of , tests a day early.  Halfcocked did not mention the app in his opening statements at the daily coronavirus briefings on June , ,  or . On June  the UK Statistics Authority said his figures were far from complete and comprehensible. On June , he thanked Serco - one of the firms involved in the app - for its assistance in the tracing programme.This week, Parliament was told the app would not be ready until winter and, besides, it was not a priority. Yesterday,  weeks after sanity required it, the government abandoned it.Turns out, the NHSX app didnapost work on older phones. It drained battery le. There were privacy concerns. Oh, and it and only traced % of an infected personaposs contacts, so you might as well have thrown all those millions into the English Channel along with a few thousand extra dead bodies.It was going to be available in weeks,  weeks ago. It was being tested, before the code was even written. The much-slower Apple Google app was produced quicker, works better, and was probably cheaper. Country after country hit problems and changed direction, but Halfcocked ploughed on. Sources, leaks, experts, and barristers all pointed out issues, but millions were spaffed up a wall trying to get the Swiss to do something weaposd have been sued for. Most of the developed world now has a phone app but we do not, and Halfcocked refuses to tell us when we might.Itaposs now obvious the app would never have achieved the critical mass of % that Parliament was told it needed, and that contact tracing was botched, then rushed out early to save embarrassment over ious Cummings and goings. Easing lockdown is now even less safe than it was, which was not very.And it seems as though Halfcocked is the worst kind of gambler - stupid. He fell for the apossunk cost fallacyapos - the idea that,you spend enough cash, a payout is guaranteed. Iceland has the worldaposs highest uptake of a coronavirus-tracing app, at % of its population. Its health minister has said it was not a game-changer. The UK government must have known, but gave millions to tech firms rather than the public health officials who were actually capable of saving lives.

Tony Hudgell set his modest target at the start of his efforts to walk  kilometreson his prosthetic legs and crutches in aid of the Evelina London Childrenaposs Hospital in Lambeth. He spent three months under their care after suffering horric physical abuse from his biological parents at just  days old. His injuries, which led to sepsis and multiple organ failure, were so severe that he eventually had to have both legs amputated at the knee.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     During the coronavirus lockdown Tony has been learning to walk on his new prosthetics by setting his fundraising challenge to walk every day in June. His adoptive parents Paula and Mark Hudgell, from Kings Hill, Kent, wanted to thank the hospital for saving the little boyaposs le, and hoped family and friends would help them reach their initial target of £. But the youngsteraposs amazing efforts - inspired when he saw -year-old Captain Sir Tom Moore walking laps of his garden to raise a staggering £ million for the NHS - have captured hearts and donations worldwide. Tonyaposs JustGiving total now stands at £, and with nine days of walking still to go, Tony is setting his sights very high.  His mum Paula, , said: Ask Tony how much money he wants to raise and he says five million thousand pounds. He obviously has no concept of money but is a very strong, determined little boy andhe wants something heaposll set about his way of getting it, so who knows. But he is very modest and is absolutely blown away - we all are - by the kindness and generosity of everyone who has taken the time to donate to such a great cause and to send us such wonderful messages of support. We can never thank the Evelina enough for what they did for Tony, and will continue to do until he is . Everyone there is like family to us and we are just so honoured and privileged to give so much back. We wanted to raise something to go towards the care of other children but this is just mind-blowing. It will make such a dference to the hospital that saved Tonyaposs le. The total however is likely to be much higher once separate online and gt aid donations have been added.  Those cheering him on have included Cha FC captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who sent the young Blues fan one of his shirts signed by all the team and manager Frank Lampard. Azpilicueta has invited Tony to the clubaposs training ground once lockdown restrictions are eased. Tony has covered around  metres a day at a green near his home since June . It has raised hopes that Tony – who also has a dislocated left hip,  arthritis  and partial deafness from the abuse – might one day walk unsupported.  Paula told the Sunday Mirror earlier this month: “When I brought Tony home he was four months old, tiny and withdrawn. He was extremely poorly, his legs in plaster and arms only out of plaster the day before. Looking at what he’s achieved, you can’t imagine he’s the same child. “We wanted him to have a challenge to seehis prosthetics would work. Since starting, he is stronger and can move so fast.” Thanking readers for their good wishes, she added: “We’re so thankful for everyone’s love and support. We’ve kept all the messages in a memory box for Tony.”  Paula and finance worker Mark, , are fighting for a “Tony’s Law” for tougher sentences for cruelty cases, with le terms for perpetrators. Biological parents Jody Simpson, , and Tony Smith, , were jailed for  years each in  for causing his injuries but will be eligible for early release in September .  Full-time carer Paula said: “More must be done to protect children.” Caroline Gormley of Evelina London said: “We are so proud Tony is part of our family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brazen burglars flaunt wads cash","story":"NewsBrazen burglars flaunt wads of cash and haul of designer gear after stealing £,The men photographed and video themselves with their ill-gotten gains after committing a series of break-ins at homes across LeicestershireShareCommentsByDave OwenKara ONeill:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video shameless-burglary-gang-photographed-themselves-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news brazen-burglars-flaunt-wads-cash-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The shameless criminals had previously stolen a safe from a country house in Illston on the Hill, near Kibworth, last year and made a short video showing them with bags of notes. The group of five men then went on a designer shopping spree at the Selfridges department store, in Birminghamaposs Bullring Shopping Centre. They blew £, on flash clobber and even took a group photograph of themselves standing outside the store surrounded by designer carrier bags. Leicestershire Police have now shared the short video and images after the brazen thieves were sentenced for their crimes at Leicester Crown Court, last week.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email As reported by LeicestershireLive, the defendants were responsible for a string of break-ins across the county. Oliver Read, , Barry Kew Moss, , Aurel Sadiki, , and Jacob Wesley, , were sentenced on Friday June, while a -year-old youth, who canapost be named for legal reasons, was sentenced for a series of offences on June . The safe was stolen in a break-in at a country house in Main Street, Illston on the Hill, in the early hours of Friday September , last year. A Land Rover Discovery used to transport the safe was also stolen in a raid on a house in Hallaton, Harborough district, on the same night, as was a Mercedes AMG during another break-in at a house in Leicester. In the early hours of October , last year, a house was then broken into in Shepshed, where an Audi A and Mercedes  were stolen.

It could not have gone better, everything from the audience to the weather to the music, its been absolutely perfect.  We had  cars with up to five people per car so about - people. He added: It was organised really quickly, in about four weeks but it was an absolute slog, some real hard graft to put it all together. It is licensed by the council which went well as we work with them regularly with other gigs at other council run facilities. We contacted them to run the idea past them and they bought into it straight away and loved it.  From there we spoke with Hampshire Constabulary who had no issues with it at all. Everyone has been really supportive. We had people either in their cars, or just to the left of their cars so everyone was socially distant with their own little safe bubble. George is now planning another aposdrive-inapos gig for July  at the same price and with the same capacity of  cars. He said:hoping after the success of tonight the council may re-do their risk assessment and allow us a few more, there is certainly the demand for it. Meanwhile, huge arena concerts could be running again by autumn, venue bosses say - but with huge changes to the gig experience. Fans could have to walk through disinfectant mists and have their temperatures taken on the way in to venues. Concertgoers could also be required to wear masks, and staff will have to wear PPE under plans being considered. Drinkers would be encouraged to order pints on smartphone apps and pubs could be patrolled to ensure social-distancing measures are enforced under plans to ease the lockdown for the hospitality sector. Boris Johnson is expected to make an announcement next week on pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels - with their reopening in England an ambition from July  to start reviving the ailing economy. With the coronavirus alert level having been reduced from four to three on Friday, the Prime Minister believes he has some space to relax measures in a boost for the sector. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Radio  that the review the PM ordered into the two-metre social distancing rule for England would be concluded within the coming days, while Whitehall officials confirmed the outcome is expected next week. The rule seeks to slow the spread of Covid- but would be a heavy restraint on the hospitality sector when it reopens, with many bosses favouring the distance being reduced.  Guidance drawn up by the sector and ministers is understood to encourage pubgoers to order drinks using apps instead of going to the bar, while current legislation was said to include the powers for patrols. The downgrading of the alert level by the UKaposs chief medical officers, including Professor Chris Whitty, means transmission of coronavirus is no longer considered to be high or rising exponentially. Localised outbreaks of Covid- are still likely to occur, the advisers warned, and the virus remains in general circulation. On Friday, Mr Johnson told the public to watch this space when asked whether the distance restriction could be reduced to help schools in Englandin autumn.

Google and Apple have automatically installed the new feature, called aposCovi- Exposure Loggingapos, to help track the spread of the virus. Although it has been automatically installed on most phones it is currently turned off and not available to use. This is because it must be used in conjunction with the countryaposs contact-tracing app, which is still under construction, Kent Online reports. The government has reportedly abandoned its own official app before its even left its testing stage despite spending millions of pounds and months on the technology. Instead, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS would use an alternative app designed by Apple and Google - which is reportedly still months away from being ready. Mr Hancock said he was unable to put a launch date on the app but it should be available in the autumn or winter. The appaposs aim is to trace anyone that a person with coronavirus symptoms came into contact with and alert them to self-isolate.  So what has been installed on my phone  Itaposs not actually an app, it is the technology to assist a future app - the Exposure Notication API. And even when the app is available, it wonapost be mandatory to download it as the NHS has said people will always have the choice of whether or not to download the app. The Exposure Notication API is automatically turned off and even after downloading the app, users can switch it off whenever they want in their phoneaposs settings. Where do I find this API   iPhone users can find it in their settings. Go to privacy, then select health and itaposll come up as the first tab. A description underneath reads: When enabled, iPhone can exchange random IDs with other devices using Bluetooth. This enables an app to noty youyou may have been exposed to Covid-. Exposure Logging cannot access any data in, or add any data to, the Health app.  On Android phones, the tracker is kept under apossettingsapos and then aposgoogle settingsapos.

Laura Davies and Dave Buchanan live in their so-called ‘Earthship’ in the Almeria province of Andalucia, in Spain.The couple became expats having moved to Spain in  and initially purchased an old Cortijo, a type of traditional rural dwelling.Earthships are an idea that originated from American architect, Michael Reynolds, and are essentially a sustainable property constructed from local and waste materials, such as old tyres and drink cans.As dreamy as it sounds, it didnapost all go according to plan for the pair, as Laura admits the project took two years to complete. And Dave also suffered a very nasty injury during the building process. Laura said: “Dave had an accident with the bench saw during construction. He nearly lost three fingers and we had to take five months off for him to recuperate. So really it only took a year and a half.”  Laura and Daveaposs love of aposEarthshipsapos came after she discovered them on the internet, revealing and “immediately fell in love with their handmade qualities.” “The thought of being able to build it ourselves was inspiring, plus the theory behind them was genius,” she said.  The couple bought a whole set of Earthship books and after reading through them all, they decided it was something they could do and started looking for land. After searching and finding the land, the pair met with the local town planner to discuss how to get permission to build and submitted their creative project to the council which was approved one year later.  The walls of the home itself are made entirely from car tyres which Laura and Dave collected from their local garage. They insist they work well at achieving a constant temperature of at least C throughout the year. Meanwhile, the inside of the walls are made from drink cans and bottles held together with mud and papier-mache.  The roof is from local pine beams and collects rainwater, which the couple use for washing, cooking, irrigating in-house planters and for the toilet. Hot water and electricity are generated through the use of solar . The insulation is natural cork from a forests near Valencia and the front of the building is glass. Acting much like a greenhouse, It also allows them to grow food. It creates solar heat and light to keep them warm during winter."},{"url":null,"title":"eerie cottage left frozen time","story":"NewsEerie cottage left frozen in time with paper from Titanic sinking still on tableA cottage left untouched since it was abandoned gives a glimpse into le more than  years ago after the previous owner lived a solitary le among the relics of the pastShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video eerie-cottage-left-frozen-time-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news eerie-cottage-left-frozen-time-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove. He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter.It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds.No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum.

Jake Wright and his we Chloe bought their property in December  but say that since they moved in, it has caused them nothing but problems. After splashing out £, on the house, they realised that the garage kept flooding, with water seeping through the brickwork.Since then, Jake, who lives in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, has put up a sign outside his house stating: Buying a Bellway Home was our worst decision. Please ask us why. Bellway has now threatened the couple with legal action over the sign, Leicestershire Live reports.Jake and Chloe have been told to take the sign down or risk being taken to court.Worried about bills  Get the latest money advice, news and help straight to your inbox - sing up at mirror emailBellway has said it is working hard to fix the issues the couple have faced and that the sign is breaching “restrictive covenants entered into at the point of sale”. Jake says he reported the issue to Bellway not long after moving in to the property. A contractor visited and seemingly fixed the issue months after they moved in. However, a few weeks later, the couple noticed that the garage was flooded. They asked the developer to fix the issue again. Jake told LeicestershireLive: “Another couple of men came out and said they knew what the issue was and that it was related to the brickwork. “So we let them fix it. They told us they would have to dig up about half of our garden, but we agreed because we wanted it sorted.”  According to Jake, the work took around four weeks to complete and most of it was completed only days before he and Chloe got married in November . Jake says that the company offered to flatten his garden to compensate for the issues that arose from the building work. But the problems didn’t stop there. Jake’s mother-in-law told the couple while on their honeymoon in Singapore that the garage had flooded once again.  Jake claims that the dispute with Bellway over the garage resulted in the National House Building Councilvisiting to inspect the building. The company has now suggested that a drain be built inside the garage to prevent the issue from occurring. But Jake says he is not happy with this suggestion. “The NHBC ruled in our favour and said that the building wasn’t up to standard, he added. “They now want to install a drain in our garage which isn’t really fixing the problem. It’s just putting a bandage on something that was a problem at the start.  “It’s just one thing after another. We’ve been going back and forth. Me and my we have had arguments and we’ve been so upset. “We’ve now been told that they aren’t going to flatten the garden anymore, despite telling us they were going to as an apology”.

Moat warned he would only stop when he was dead and he eventually shot himself after a six-hour stand-off with police seven days later. Katelaine and her mum, who has three younger children, learnt of his rampage on the TV. Caroline knew with Moat on the loose the family had to flee. Katelaine recalls: “It all happened really quick. I was playing out, Mum shouted us in and said: ‘I dreaded this moment, we need to leave the area.’ I remember some fear, being very still, thinking about it, ‘Is this really happening ’”  With a police escort, they fled and stayed with relatives in the Midlands. Speaking from her home near Newcastle, the emotions Katelaine still wrestles with – shame, disgust, abandonment – are painfully clear. She said: I’m so sorry to the people he has hurt. If I had the chance to meet the victims and their families and say I’m so sorry for what my dad did, and show that I care, I would.” Katelaine, who has Moat’s strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes, adds: “Being his flesh and blood sickens me at times, it’s hard to believe who I am.  “I’m so glad I didn’t know him, and that I became the person I am today despite all I have been through.” She was relentlessly bullied through school, taunted for her physical similarity to Moat. Recently, she was playing with a social media app that swaps the sex of people in photos. Blinking her piercing blue eyes, she admits the result was horrying.  “I did it and oh my God, I regretted it so much,” she says. “I showed my mum and she nearly had a heart attack. I looked like -year-old Raoul Moat.” Katelaine thought her mum Caroline’s ex-partner was her dad, until a relative told her the truth when she was around seven. Caroline, who had hoped to protect her, was then honest, explaining her real father “had been a good man, but the drugs and stuff had taken over”.  In fact, Katelaine was to learn her mum had suffered attacks by Moat after they met in . His volatile nature was magnied by his bodybuilder’s steroid addiction and when Caroline told him she was pregnant with Katelaine, he threatened to kill the unborn child. Caroline took out an injunction and Moat moved on, refusing ever to meet the little girl. Yet with moving honesty, Katelaine admits she still, in a way, yearns for the dad she never knew.  She writes him a birthday card each year on June , poignantly close to Father’s Day – then she burns it and releases a balloon to float away. “It is not about honouring him. It is not for him, but for me, for my peace of mind, she said. “I do a little speech in my head. One year it might be: ‘I hope you’re proud of me despite everything you have done.’ Other times I have thought: ‘Why couldn’t you just be the right person  Do the right thing ’” Katelaine remembers vividly Moat ending his le, as the stand-off was broadcast on rolling TV news a week later. “I watched it,” she says, bluntly, although says she can’t recall the emotions she felt at the time. “Everyone instantly looked at me and Mum cried.” At the end of that summer she started secondary school though the timing was terrible. She recalls: “I was targeted. People would be like ‘You’re Raoul Moat’s daughter’.” She began truanting.

The grieving family of Nicole Smallman, , and Bibaa Henry, , spoke of the “devastating impact” of their loss as detectives continue to hunt the murderer. They were repeatedly stabbed by a stranger who stalked them in a city park in the early hours of Saturday June  while they were dancing to music. The killer sustained a serious injury as the sisters fought for their lives and left a trail of blood. In a statement, the parents of the two sisters said: “The greatest fear of any parent is that they will outlive their children. “What makes our situation unique is that two adored sisters were murdered together on the same night. “The grief we feel is palpable, our beautul and talented daughters gone.” The fact the sisters were dancing to music with fairy lights meant their attacker could have stalked them from a distance without fear of being heard. Police have received more than  calls from the public following an appeal for information. The sisters were killed in Fryent Country Park, in Wembley, northwest London, after meeting friends there to celebrate Bibaa’s birthday.  Searches of the scene are continuing, but police have found the murder weapon. They also recovered their mobile phones from a pond in the park. Police said the pair were in “good spirits” and “taking selfie pictures, listening to music and dancing with fairy lights” until at least .am on June . Friends had left their celebration throughout the evening, with the sisters ending up alone in the park by around .am. Their last contact with friends and family was about .am, police said. The bodies of the two women were found next to each other shortly after pm on June .  The killer appears to have spent time trying hide his victims in a wooded area. The sisters’ mother is Wilhelmina Smallman, the Church of England’s first BAME female archdeacon. Bibaa, from Brent in north-west London, was an “exceptional” senior social worker and “a passionate advocate for safeguarding vulnerable children and families”. Her family said that before she qualied she would drive disabled children to their activities, “singing as they drove along”.  She loved her family, including her father, a former amateur boxing champion and building contracting company owner, and mother, who trained as a teacher and to become a priest. Nicole, from Harrow in north-west London, was the youngest of three sisters, described as someone who “saw beauty in everything” and had a “very calm and positive attitude towards most things in le”. Her family said she was “a strong advocate for humanitarian causes and saving our planet” as well as an “amazing photographer, actor and singer” with a “silky smooth” voice. “Friends and family all agree she was beautul both inside and out,” her family said. They added: “Bibaa and Nicole were sisters whose untimely deaths we will spend the rest of our lives trying to come to terms with. “The tributes for our girls keep flooding in it has been comforting, heartbreaking and at times overwhelming. Faith and prayer is keeping us going. I’m not sure how we’d get through this without it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"latest coronavirus hotspots high r","story":"NewsLatest coronavirus hotspots with a high R rate - what is the infection rate near you The R number, which is the effective reproduction value of a disease, is now close to one in parts of UK and so there are fears theyll be a second wave of Covid-ShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video explained-what-r-number-how-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news latest-coronavirus-hotspots-high-r-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Customers may have to go through decontamination chambers, use an app to book a trip to the toilet or undergo temperature checks.Mannequins will be set up at tables to ensure social distancing, staff will be wearing face shields and there will be an unprecedented outdoor dining scheme, the Manchester Evening News reports. Restaurants have been restricted to deliveries and takeaways since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed in March, although many decided to shut and some have already gone out of business. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.       But they, along with pubs, hairdressers and beauty parlours, are hoping to be given the green light to reopen on July , and they are busy preparing for theof customers, In Manchester, curry house and grill Zouk will ask diners to pass through a decontamination chamber at the door. They will be sprayed with a mist of non-toxic disinfectant to kill viruses, bacteria and other pathogens they may be carrying. Tayub Amjad, CEO of Zouk, said: It actually came from a customer who is a regular. They were talking about something they were trying to put into the airport and I said why donapost you bring me a sample down and weaposll try it out and see.  It looks brilliant. Customers will have the choice of walking straight through or they can stay inside for  to  seconds. Anything on your clothes, it kills, and itaposs safe to breathe in. Obviously youaposll still have to wash your hands  minutes later but anything that was on your hands, itaposs killed. We thought it would give customers and staff a bit of reassurance that nothing has come into the restaurant. As for social distancing measures, he said: I was trying to avoid screens, because they donapost look brilliant, so weaposve had designers in to see what we could do instead. One of the options was to put mannequins on the tables weaposre not using, or just remove tables, but we havenapost made a decision yet. He added: Obviously weaposll have somebody dedicated to cleaning the areas people will touch the most, and weaposll have some hand sanitiser stations around the restaurant. Something I donapost like but we are going to offer to staff is face masks and shields. It will be up to them - so far people are happier with the shields because they canapost talk properly through masks. Weaposre also looking at using an app so you can order at your table and the waiter time at the table is dramatically reduced.  Many restaurants canapost afford to be closed much longer. Mr Amjad, like many bosses, is eager to reopen. He said: Iaposm really looking forward to it, we canapost wait because itaposs been that long. Weaposve been doing takeaways and meals for charities and things to keep ourselves busy but we really want to get back open and be welcoming customers back. In Westminster, central London, the council is planning to transform the area into a continental-style outdoor dining area in a bid to keep restaurants and bars afloat.  There will be temporary road closures to create outdoor dining space in places such as Chinatown, Covent Garden, Soho and Mayfair. Small streets around Oxford Circus could be shut to make room for dining tables. There will be a ban on standing and drinking outside. Drinkers would be encouraged to order pints on smartphone apps and pubs could be patrolled to ensure social-distancing measures are enforced under plans to ease the lockdown for the hospitality sector.  Boris Johnson is expected to make an announcement next week on pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels - with their reopening in England an ambition from July  to start reviving the ailing economy.With the coronavirus alert level having been reduced on Friday, the Prime Minister believes he has some space to relax measures in a boost for the sector. Guidance drawn up by the sector and ministers is understood to encourage pubgoers to order drinks using apps instead of going to the bar, while current legislation was said to include the powers for patrols. The Times reported that restaurant tables would not be set in advance and room service would be left outside doors in hotels under the guidance.In some bars and restaurants, customers may be forced to use an app to book a trip to the toilet. Sort-It, a new app developed by a Manchester tech firm, allows that option, along with ordering food and drink from the table. Director John Sanderson said: A lot of people wonapost like the idea of going to the bar and getting jostled. Ordering at the table is just common sense. Itaposs all about reducing movement in the bar.  He said customers can use the app to seethe toilets are vacant. He added: When you request it, itaposs locked to your table and nobody  can request it. Staff are also sent a cleaning task to sanitise the toilet before the next guest uses it. Only when staff have cleaned that will it go green again. It means thereaposll never be a queue for the bathroom, people wonapost be passing each other on the way, and in between visits staff are being managed to implement the cleaning protocols.

Gemma Collins discovered she had a rare form of bone cancer sarcoma while she was expecting little Phoebe.She had suffered the heartbreak of going through several rounds of unsuccessful IVF treatment before discovering she was pregnant in February last year, Chronicle Live reports.With the cancer growing rapidly, Phoebe had to be born three months early so she could start treatment.Gemma made it through a brutal six months of chemotherapy, and there were times when her family feared she wouldn’t make it as she contracted sepsis and suffered numerous complications.But both Gemma and Phoebe made it home in time to celebrate their first Christmas as a family, and seemed to be doing well until three weeks ago when Gemma woke up to find she couldn’t move. An MRI scan found that she had brain tumours linked to the sarcoma, leaving the family devastated. With one tumour in too dangerous a place to be operated on, the -year-old from Cramlington, Northumberland, has now started chemotherapy again. Gemma is living with her mum Margaret Bateman as husband Anthony looks after Phoebe, and while they still see each other every day, her worst fear is her daughter growing up without a mother.  She said: “It’s so hard when you’ve wanted something for so long, that le can be so cruel to take it away. “It’s just hard because I was doing so well, to go to bed one night and then feel like that again. I can’t quite get over the shock.” When Gemma first became ill she put it down to her pregnancy but as her condition deteriorated, a scan in May revealed that she had a cm tumour behind her heart and sarcoma. “I started to get poorly at the same time as I found out, so I thought it was something to do with the pregnancy,” she said.  “By the time I got to May I couldn’t really walk, I was getting so breathless. “The hospital were holding off doing a CT scan because of me being pregnant, but when she got to  weeks and was fine they looked more into what was wrong with me.”Gemma was transferred to Newcastle ’s Freeman Hospital and as she was getting weaker, doctors arranged for Phoebe to be born by C-section on July , at  weeks - She weighed just lbs oz.Medics waited  days for Gemma’s scar to heal before she started chemotherapy, starting off a gruelling six months of treatment. Gemma was separated for much of that time from her daughter as Phoebe stayed in the Royal Victoria Infirmary, but charity Tiny Lives sent her video updates every day.Gemma’s mum Margaret said: “Phoebe was perfect - a proper little miracle. She came off the ventilator after five days.” But as Phoebe thrived, Gemma suffered complications and contracted sepsis and at one point the hospital brought Phoebe to see her for what could have been a goodbye. But she pulled through and, by May this year, Phoebe was strong and healthy and Gemma was looking forward to getting on with her le but one day she woke up and couldn’t move.  A scan showed she now had tumours in the back of her head, and a planned operation was cancelled when surgeons saw one was in too dangerous a position for surgery. Gemma has now started chemotherapy again to stop the tumours from growing, and is staying with her mum so she can rest during treatment.

And his proud parents, Ethan and Frances, from Walderslade, Kent, have finally been allowed to hold him for the first time months after doctors told them that he likely wouldnapost survive.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Dubbed Rocky for his fight for survival, Oliver, who was born breach, has suffered two perforated bowel operations, had  blood transfusions, had two bleeds on the lungs, one bleed on the brain, three collapsed lung incidents and heart problems. He is finally out of danger and his parents are breathing a huge sigh of relief. His mother Frances, , had to wait nine weeks before she could hold her son for the very first time. She said: It was so, so dficult not being able to hold him but the moment I was allowed was the most incredible moment of my le. Words canapost really describe it. It was just amazing to be able to touch and hold after so long.Iaposd looked forward to it for so long I didnapost know what to expect but it was the most amazing thing, just totally amazing. Iaposve never experienced anything like it. The emotions I felt were so overwhelming. I felt like crying but I was also completely overjoyed. The second time I held him I was able to cuddle him skin to skin and the doctors were amazed by his response because he was so calm. It was such a positive experience for him and for me and I felt like I was finally bonding properly with him. Now when I go over to London to see him I can hold him each time and he loves it. Not being able to hold him for the first nine weeks was torture but now it is incredible. Ethan said: Because only one of us was allowed into the hospital on each visit I had to wait until the following week. I bought a new shirt so that I could easily put him on my chest to do skin to skin and it was an emotional moment.He was so warm, like a tiny cooked chicken, and the wave of love for him I felt at that moment was amazing. He was really relaxed and the doctors could see he was really enjoying it. I spent two hours that day just holding him to me and it is a time I will never forget. It was amazing. It is now  weeks since Oliver was born but he was not due until July .  The couple say Oliver was on three dferent types of ventilator and had syringe drivers to administer drugs. At one point he had a cannula in each of his two arms and two legs and an extra cannula had to be inserted into his forehead because there wasnapost enough room left. Ethan, , a learning dficulty support team leader, and Frances, a Costa barrista, are so thankful to medics who saw their tiny son through his darkest days. Ethan said: He is an amazing fighter and heaposs got the nickname of Rocky because he wonapost stay down. Weaposre so proud of him to have come through all the challenges he has faced so far.  We have twice been taken into a room by the doctors and told to prepare for the worst. Each time they said the chances of him surviving surgery were extremely slim and he might not make it. Each time we have faced up to the fact he could die but each time he has managed to pull through and, with the help of the most amazing hospital staff, he is still fighting. Frances added: Whilst I was in labour a doctor told me that he only had a three percent chance of survival.  Problems began during Francesapos pregnancy when she began to suffer a bulge in her waters. She was admitted at  weeks and four days pregnant to Medway Hospital in Kent where she was told to rest. Doctors told the couple that the chances of their baby survivinghe was born were tiny. Frances said: The doctors put me on a bed at an angle so that my legs were higher than my head to let gravity do its work to keep Oliver in as long as possible.  Ethan said: They said he wasnapost aposviableapos which is a horrible, horrible word but we knew what they meant. The doctors were hoping he would stay in the womb until he had developed further as we knew it would be touch and go. They gave Frances drugs to help speed the development of the babyaposs lungs and heart but just two days later she went into labour with her mum, Natasha, by her side. After a traumatic labour their son was breach born weighing just  grams on March  - just three days into lockdown. Ethan said: He was born breach and was really, really small but he gave a little cry and doctors knew he was in with a chance.He was transferred to an incubator in the neo-natal unit and hooked up to drips to try to stabilise his blood pressure.Initially he seemed to be holding his own but around  days after his birth he deteriorated rapidly. He was diagnosed with a perforated bowel and he was rushed to hospital in Brighton in an ambulance under flashing blue lights.  Once there, doctors told the couple they would have to operate but that the chances of Oliver-Cash surviving were extremely slim. Ethan said: They told us to prepare for the worst because the chances of him surviving the surgery with just a small percentage. He has five centimetres of bowel removed and luckily he pulled through and fought to survive. However he was also treated for a collapsed lung and then had complications with his bowel.  He is mow off a ventilator has put on weight and has risen from is birth weight of lb oz to almost lbs. Ethan said: Heaposs definitely grown and he continues to make good progress as we have so much love for him. Dr Ryan Watkins, Consultant Neonatologist at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: Babies born at such a young age face a dficult start in le and I am so proud of the expert care our teams provide. Itaposs always a dficult time for parents and especially those who are a long way from home. For each family, weaposve made sure both parents can visit safely, are able to stay for longer and our nursing team shares regular pictures and video of their babyaposs progress. Caroline Lee-Davey, Chief Executive at the premature and sick baby charity Bliss said: Our thoughts are with Oliver-Cash , Ethan, Frances and all families with a baby in neonatal care during lockdown. Itaposs never easy to have a newborn baby in hospital, but we are hearing some heart-breaking stories from families who are separated from their sick or premature baby due to Covid-. Itaposs particularly painful for parents to have limited access to their baby, especially when they are very sick like Oliver-Cash has been. It is very important that hospital trusts remember that parents like Ethan and Frances are not visitors.

As reopened retailers prepared for a post-lockdown sales surge, she said: “I wish all businesses every success.” The Royal Family today pitched in to help get Britain spending again as shops prepared for a bumper month of post-lockdown sales. After nearly three months of closure and uncertainty, retailers have reopened in an effort to ­kickstart the battered economy. The Queen told of her pride in firms that supported the NHS and ­the most vulnerable during the crisis, as they battled to stay afloat. And the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge today joined the family effort to encourage people to visit local businesses. It comes as shoppers are predicted to spend £billion this month and bring fresh hope to the high street. The Queen spoke amid a wave of support for the Mirror’s Shop for Britain campaign. In a message as patron of the British Chambers of Commerce, she said: “As many organisations around the country are reopening, I send my best wishes and support to business communities across the UK, Commonwealth and across the world. “At a time of great dficulty for many, it is heartwarming to see the civic response and generosity of so many businesses, small and large, to the challenges posed, whether supporting the health sector or vulnerable communities.  “It gives me great pride to see the contribution you and your members are making to help firms, champion trade and rebuild communities. I wish all ­businesses every success in their endeavours in the weeks and months ahead.” Prince William today lent his support to family-run Smiths the Bakers in King’s Lynn, Norfolk – not far from his Anmer Hall home where he, Kate and their children George, six, Charlotte, five and ­two-year-old Louis, have been staying during lockdown. The firm’s business mostly comes from wholesale, including to schools, which had closed. But it is now starting to see customers . William, , told Paul and Therese Brandon, who run the shop: “The important thing is that shops like yours can get the footfall back in again and the high street and town feel like it’s getting a little bit more back to normal.  I think everyone’s just been, you know, in a daze. They don’t quite know what to make of it all.” Scanning their products, he added: “I can’t come in here and not buy anything, so have you got any pain au chocolat at all  “My children will not talk to meI turn up without enough.” The prince bought four, costing a total of £.. Pulling out his contactless card, he declared: “I hope this works. Good, it’s still working, first time out in a while.” Not far away, Kate visited Fakenham Garden Centre – choosing plants and seeds for the couple’s children. The -year-old told owners Martin and Jennie Turner: “They love it. It’s such a great space for children and families to come to. “I’ve been food shopping but I have to say I haven’t been out a huge amount, but it’s good and so important, now as things start to ease, people know they can go out and particularly to places like this.” In another boost for Britain, banking trade body UK Finance backed our campaign. Its managing director of commercial finance, Stephen Pegge, said: “High streets play a vital role in local communities and will be central to the UK’s economic recovery. “We are proud to be supporting the Mirror’s Shop for Britain campaign.” UK Finance revealed banks provided , bounceback loans worth £.billion to retailers and wholesalers during lockdown. Many shops in England are thought to have held off reopening until today, despite getting the green light on Monday. Research showed shoppers can look forward to big discounts.  Brightpearl, an operations  for retailers, revealed almost three in  shop bosses questioned said the sales could dwarf those offered on Black Friday and Boxing Day. Official figures out today revealed a ­better-than-expected recovery in retail sales last month. Takings jumped nearly % between April and May, the Office for National Statistics showed. Intu, which owns Manchester’s ­Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, said visitor numbers since Monday were up % on last week. George Brown, of investment bank Investec, predicted retail sales could rise another % in June. That would be an extra £billion, taking spending back above the £billion. He added: “Signicantly, this would take retail sales pretty much back to the levels seen in February.” Experts believe the online sales surge will slow as more shops reopen.  But Centre for Retail Research director Professor Joshua Bamfield warned the high street recovery would be slow. He said of today’s trading: “I think it will be reasonable, but it won’t be stupendous.” The Government has extended measures to prevent struggling high street stores being evicted during the summer until September.Best high street bargains as shops reopen The high street reopened this week and bargains abound.

Her basic swap saves her almost  per cent - with one she picked up costing just p compared to the other which was £.. She also films herself reaching to the back of the shelves for her vegetables which she says will mean she gets the fresher products.

The other major change, which has helped her come in under £, is the lack of meat.

They are developing a monitoring programme that can measure the presence of Covid- in waste water. Presence of the virus in human waste is common in almost all confirmed coronavirus cases. The move comes after a waste water study in Italy showed that the coronavirus might have been present in the country as early as December. Coronavirus has also been found in sewage in China.  Sampling will begin almost immediately in a small number of water treatment plants, rapidly expanding to up to  treatment plants that cover approximately % of the Welsh population, reports Wales Online. At the same time as monitoring for coronavirus, the systems established will also be able to determine whether other types of respiratory viruses are also present which will aid public health monitoring. Commenting on the pilot project, which will be funded for the next six months, Health Minister Vaughan Gething, said: To halt the spread of the coronavirus we need to measure it within our communities and monitor changes. This pilot programme will allow us to develop an early warning system to provide signals on the levels of coronavirus infections in the community. This will complement our wider public health programmes, including testing. The funding provides the opportunity to build upon existing strengths and partnerships that we have in Wales in environmental sciences, disease surveillance and pathogen genomics. I’m pleased to be working with partners from across Wales.  The World Health Organisationsaid there is currently no evidence that coronavirus has been transmitted via sewerage systems. Professor Andrew Weightman, head of the Organisms and Environment Division at Cardf Universityaposs School of Biosciences, said: Knowledge of how this virus is spreading in the community is a vital part of preventing the spread, particularly as lockdown measures are eased.

And Britain could bask in the hottest day of the year so far next week, with sunny weather moving in from the weekend. Met Office meteorologists said temperatures are forecast to rise day by day, and could reach C in London by Wednesday.The current record for this year was set on May , when the mercury reached .C at Santon Downham in Suffolk. This beat the previous record set just the day before when Londonaposs St Jamesaposs Park recorded a high of .C.

By comparison, it says Spanish holiday island Majorca will experience highs of C on the same days. Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Andy Page said: “Saturday will be brighter with many of us enjoying a dry day with warm sunshine and just a few isolated showers. A band of rain will move east across the UK during Saturday night, clearing Sunday morning, then it’ll be another bright day for most on Sunday with sunny spells and scattered showers, these turning heavy across Northern Ireland and Scotland.” Early next week it will stay unsettled across north-western parts of the UK, where however it’ll be warm and dry with temperatures continuing to rise through the week.

I’m still in disbelief months later. It was bonkers for a while. When we’d first met our babe months earlier, his little smiling face melted my heart. Now that we had him home, it was still so hard to believe he was ours….a lot like it felt when we brought Ivy home from the hospital. Our poor boy must have been so confused to not have his foster family with him suddenly. He didn’t sleep well for a long time but throughout the day, he was - and still is the most smiling little ray of sunshine ever. Because we had constant social worker visits and calls and checks it felt like we were just babysitting for him for a long time and that was really, really hard. He’s a super clever little boy and when he started walking at only  months old, he was into everything. Boisterous, inquisitive and feisty. He bumped his forehead and we followed instructions from social workers to inform themhe ever has a bump….. it turned into an absolute nightmare for us. It was absolutely horric and even though we followed NHS guidelines for bumps , we were told one night thatwe didn’t bring him into AE, someone would come and collect him from our home. I was absolutely devastated to be treated this way and for them to remind usthat he was still classed as a ‘cared for’ child and we have to do whatever they ask. At one point, they even said they would escort us to the doctor. It was horrible. I  billion percent understand that they have to be soooo careful with adopted children because of all the horror stories that have happened in the past. But we had been subjected to the most thorough checks imaginable, character references, training, everything. The fact that we couldn’t be trusted with our own child was a massive blow. Obviously he was fine and the staff at the hospital thought it was ridiculous that we’d been forced to bring him in but that incident put us on absolute egg shells until the adoption was finalised.It was definitely a challenge but worth every single ounce of stress for those chubby little cheeks of his. He is the most snuggly little boy in the world, he loves a hug and it’s just the most glorious feeling in the world when he toddles over to me and hugs my legs. Ivy and him get on so well. I couldn’t have asked for it to be more perfect. It took Ivy a few weeks to adapt. It was a massive change for her and there were night terrors, tantrums - and of course jealousy. I felt terrible, we’d just turned her little world upside down. We honestly thought she wouldn’t cope. But she couldn’t help herself, she caved to his snuggles in no time and we were amazed how quickly she adapted.  We reminded her - and still do how special she is to us. We told her that she would always be our number one girl and Bill was our number one boy. We had one on one time every day so she still knew that we were there whenever she wanted. It helped so much and that’s something so important to consider when a new child comes into a family! Now we are free of scrutiny - don’t get me wrong, most of our social workers were incredible and we will keep in touch with them for a long long time. But now it just feels so good for him to be completely ours. For a while, I never dared to dream that this would be possible but like I always say, when you have hope, anything is possible.

Back in , three-year-old Kimberley Colbeck and her brothers Andrew and Christopher, then aged  and , created their own time capsules at their terraced home in Guiseley, Leeds.The trio scribbled small hand-written notes in pencil, before rolling them up, placing them inside a glass bottle and hiding them in the walls of the home while a new kitchen was being fitted, as reported by Leeds Live. Now,  years later, not only were the messages discovered by builders renovating the property, but they have been reunited with Kim after she spotted a post about the find on Facebook.Inside a piece of pink paper labelled aposplese readapos, the trio of siblings left a message reading: This note was left by Andrew Colbeck age , Christopher Colbeck age , Kimberley Colbeck age  on the   .

But when her health started to deteriorate in  and she hurt her back, she knew she needed to make a change. The mother-of-two from Bradford decided it was time to retire from school and spend more time at home with her family. While recovering from her injury she taught herself to bake and has gone on to launch her own award-winning cake business, called Cup Caker. Her edible treats can be compared to works of art which is why theyaposve garnered plenty of attention online - and even the Royal Family are fans of her work. Back in January, Siama was given the opportunity to bake a showstopping display of cakes for Prince William and Kate Middleton when they visited her city. The royal couple were gted a towering red, white, blue and gold cake and a number of cupcakes featuring photos from throughout their le. The cake hit the headlines during the visit, as one particular photo on it captured the Duke of Cambridgeaposs attention. The royal did a double take when he spotted a photo of his -year-old self as the resemblance to his daughter, Princess Charlotte, was striking. He asked: Is that me  Doesnapost it look like Charlotte  The Duchess of Cambridge, also came for a closer look and agreed with her husband saying: It looks so much like Charlotte.  Siama admits that his comment initially made her nervous, as she was worried she had made a mistake and mixed up the pictures. Having only three days to pull everything together for the royal visit meant the baker had been working round the clock to finish the cakes - and was very tired by the end. When Prince William could not believe that was him in one of the images I chose from his childhood, it made me question myself as I was very tired when I was choosing pictures and deciding which to use to create my story, she recalls. Boy was I glad it was Prince William and realising the resemblance to Charlotte was amazing.  She went on to explain how she ended up making the cake in the first place and where the inspiration came from. She said: I was initially contacted by Sofia Buncy who works at The Khidmat Centre in Bradford. She thought of me as I had made her wedding cake a few months back. I will be very honest I did not have enough time to even think about it and went along with what I do best using my initiative and creativity at the time of decorating.I baked four tiers with all dferent flavors including chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, and lemon.  Despite feeling rushed in making the cakes, Siama says she is content she made Bradford proud with her work as William and Kateaposs reactions were more than expected. Their reactions were more than what I had expected especially hearing their aposWOWapos upon seeing the display. I designed and created a little journey of their le through the edible images on the cupcakes represented in mini edible frames, they were very comforting with their words and complimented my hard work which itself felt very rewarding especially when Prince William mentioned how proud Mary Berry would be of me! She continued: Duchess Kate also gestured to me that she wanted to pinch a cupcake!  The Duke and Duchess were so impressed with the spread, Siama claims they asked to take home the top tier of the cake and the cupcakes. The baker has since been rewarded for her efforts with an invitation to attend a garden party at Buckingham Palace. I feel very privileged indeed and very grateful to have received a letter from The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge thanking me for their cake and cupcakes and complimenting how delicious they were. I couldn’t have asked for a better review!Due to Covid- the Garden Tea Party has been rescheduled for next year but Deputy Lieutenant Kevin Sharp has informed me I will be receiving an invitation soon when dates have been confirmed by the Royal Palace.  Following on from the royal visit, Siamaaposs Instagram has been filled with new cakes - each one more impressive than the last. The baker makes cakes for all occasions, with a number of Disney-themed birthday ones and glamorous wedding treats adorned with sparkly decorations. She plans to start offering online classes soon to share her baking tips and tricks with her , followers.

Deaths in the country also rose by ,, taking the official tally to ,, although the true figure is feared to be far higher. There is no widespread testing programme in the country with the true figure of cases thought to be as many as ten times higher. Second only to the United States in both cases and deaths, Brazil confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on February . The virus has spread relentlessly across the continent-sized country, eroding support for right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and raising fears of economic collapse. Brazil had reported ,, confirmed cases on Friday, with and is likely to surpass , deaths on Saturday, although weekend reporting can be lower. Even so, the true extent of the outbreak far exceeds the official figures, according to many experts, who cite a lack of widespread testing. That number of  million is much less than the real number of people who have been infected, because there is under-reporting of a magnitude of five to  times, said Alexandre Naime Barbosa, a medical professor at the Sao Paulo State University.  The true number is probably at least  million and could even be as high as  million people.COVID-, the illness caused by the coronavirus, arrived in Brazil via wealthy tourists ing from Europe to major southeastern cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and has spread deep into the interior, reaching % of Brazilapossmunicipalities, Health Ministry data showed.Bolsonaro, sometimes called the Tropical Trump, has been widely criticized for his handling of the crisis. The country still has had no permanent health minister after losing two since April, following clashes with the president.  Bolsonaro has shunned social distancing, calling it a job-killing measure more dangerous than the virus itself. He has also promoted two anti-malarial drugs as remedies, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, despite little evidence they work. The far-right former army captainaposs handling of the crisis has prompted Brazilians to bang pots and pans regularly outside their apartments in protest, but it has not stopped him from wading into costly political battles with his own cabinet and the Supreme Court, stoking fears of instability.  Pressure from Bolsonaro and public fatigue after months of ineffective state and local isolation orders has led governors and mayors to begin lting restrictions on commerce and other economic activity. Public health experts have warned that loosening restrictions too soon threatens to accelerate contagion and drive up fatalities. We think that there will be a new wave after the loosening of these measures, said Ricardo Langer, a doctor treating COVID- patients at the MaracanÃ£ stadium field hospital in Rio de Janeiro.

Now she is not only keeping her job but posing as a model for a Russian sports clothes line. Pictures show her wearing ZASPORT sport clothes, a brand founded by the daughter of a top FSB security service official. Nadia has also announced that she plans to study to become a doctor. In her first detailed interview on last month’s lingerie scandal, Nadia confessed she was still embarrassed to talk about it”. She told the brand’s website: “I understand what day this photo was taken, but how this spread so quickly over the Internet is still a mystery to me. “I remember that I ed from my sht, andalready sharing with me the link to the story.”  The revealing pictures had been taken by one of her male patients. “Of course, I recognised myself and immediately closed my social network accounts …. I was not ready for such attention,” said Nadia. Going viral around the world was “just awful” but she praised her medical colleagues for their support, and the initial disciplinary move against her was reversed as support flooded in. Founder of the clothes brand Anastasia Zadorina, , called Nadia “one of the symbols of the coronavirus era.  “This is a young, beautul and very brave girl, who makes her big contribution to the fight against Covid.” Zadorina, , is daughter of FSB colonel-general Mikhail Shekin, and her brand has a track record of promoting clothing adorned with patriotic and anti-Western slogans alluding to Russian missiles such as “Topol is not afraid of sanctions” and “Sanctions  Don’t tell my Iskanders”. Nadia said Vladimir Putin’s former bodyguard Alexey Dyumin, , now governor of Tula region, strongly backed her. She said: The chief doctor of our hospital , and even the governor of the Tula region, also spoke in my defence - thank you very much…  “I continued to go on my shts, and it is very pleasant that my colleagues and the whole team supported me. “They encouraged me: ‘Don’t worry! Youaposre a beautul one!’ “Doctors from other cities set up flash mobs to support me. “They understood that nobody knows how hot it is to work in a protective suit in summer.  “It is asyou spend several hours in a sauna. It even becomes hard to breathe and walk.” Her ZASPORT photoshoot came ahead of Russia’s Medic Day, which will be marked on Sunday, the professional holiday for doctors and nurses. But despite her new fame and role as a model, Nadia is determined study to become a doctor. “My goal is to go to medical university,” she said.

A lot of what a teacher does standing in front of a class giving information can be done via video and giving readings and so on.Professor Topping#Is the one option much more cost effective than the other  I would suspect it is but of course it requires a substantial sht on behalf of the teachers.#The issue of blended learning has proved to be controversial in recent weeks, with calls growing on the Scottish Government to provide greater clarity as to how often children will be in school once the new term gets underway.But Professor Topping, who was once described as an #outstanding researcher# by President Bill Clinton for his work in the America Reads initiative, believes that the blended learning approach could be a positive change in education.He explained: #This could be an opportunity to realise that things can be achieved through blended learning, at least partially, and we will be able to think more strategically to understand how children are learning.#Blended learning done properly has a number of advantages. A lot of what a teacher does standing in front of a class giving information can be done via video and giving readings and so on.#But the interactive part of what usually happens in the classroom is something that is a lot harder to do via this model. So the trust of what I#m saying is that you could have kids in school in the morning and then going back home in afternoon to do work.#Pupils across the country have been taught at home since schools shut their doors in March but concerns have been raised over disparities in how much children are actually learning.Frankly, I would not be all that happyteachers got to the end of the pandemic and went back to doing what they always did.Prof Topping said: #What will be happening here is that the kids who are already advantaged will be getting more advantaged and they will not have any obvious fall in their educational development.#But kids who don#t have that opportunity for whatever reason will be further behind again, so there will be an increase in the gap between those who have and those who have not.#There are many kids that don#t have a computer at home and many families who can#t afford an internet link so what on earth these kids are doing, I have no idea. But I have a horrible feeling they are falling very far behind indeed.#It#s this concern that has led to a number of politicians, including former Conservative education secretary Justine Greening, calling for alternative buildings like churches and community centres to be used to get more kids back to school.This, Professor Topping believes, is a good idea but is not as simple as it sounds.He added: #The idea is certainly a viable and sensible one.  The problem is finding the building and enabling it to operate as an educational environment. It#s not going to be quick to do this and will take a lot of planning and organisation.#It#s not just a case of throwing a few computers and kids in a room.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Government support, in the UK at large but also in Scotland, does not cover the  costs of the HE sector.#International student recruitment has been a major way in which universities have made up for this shortfall international students subsidise home students.#But with the pandemic, and the projected drop in international students, especially those coming from China, the fundamental problems with the model are clear to see and actually threaten the sector#s viability.#Universities offer not just economic, social and cultural benefit, for iniduals and communities, but the sector is  engaged in research which is offering new hopes for corona virus treatment and the potential for a vaccine. In this moment, we see how research carried out at UK universities has the potential to save lives around the world.#As a teacher and a researcher, I am worried for the sector#s future without a fundamental change to the funding model.#The letter from the academics highlights concerns over funding and income, saying:  #UK public spending on tertiary education amounts to only a quarter of university budgets, which is not only the lowest among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentcountries, but comprises considerably less than half of the average spending among the OECD’s other  countries.#It is therefore not surprising that nearly  percent of all UK universities wereIt goes on to state: #A vibrant and robust higher education system is absolutely vital for the UK’s future. We believe that the current government funding model for higher education is inadequate for this task and we therefore call upon you to use the current crisis as an opportunity to create a new deal for higher education.#Rather than providing a one-time bailout, it is paramount that the UK and devolved governments substantially increases public spending on tertiary education in line with the OECD average in order to ensure that our tertiary institutions remain at the forefront of global research, education and innovation.#Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science Richard Lochhead said:“We are working closely with Universities Scotland on how the sector can remain at the forefront of global education when we emerge from this crisis.“Ministers have commissioned work on the future provision and sustainability of colleges and universities in light of the pandemic. The Scottish Funding Council will look at how its existing models of funding, governance and delivery can exploit new opportunities and continue to support our world-class further and higher education systems.“The Scottish Government last month announced a £ million increase in funding for universities to ensure they can protect their world-leading research programmes against the financial impact of Covid-.“I continue to press the UK Government to recognise the scale of the impact of Covid- on the higher education sector, and for HM Treasury to ensure appropriate fiscal support is made available.”A spokeswoman for the UK Government Department of Education said: “We understand this is a very challenging time for universities and higher education staff, which is why we have introduced a package of measures to stabilise the admissions system, ease pressures on universities’ finances and boost support for students.“We have confirmed universities’ eligibility to apply for government-backed loan and financing packages worth at least £m according to Office for Students estimates, along with reprofiling £m of research funding and £.bn worth of tuition fee payments for providers.“We will continue to work closely with the sector to understand the financial dficulties they are experiencing at this time.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"draw your own ee picture gallery north east kids get creative during lockdown2006","story":"Children across the north-east have been showcasing their artistic skills with their own version of the Evening Express# front page.More than  images were submitted and we#ve featured every picture in our gallery below."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/SNS-19128637-Aberdeen-v-ICT-e1564731777195.jpg ","title":"dons winger out after ankle surgery","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes today confirmed winger Matty Kennedy will be out for three weeks after ankle surgery.Kennedy had a #tidy up# procedure on a problem that had flared up during lockdown.January signing Kennedy is back working with the club’s physios and is scheduled toto training in mid-July.McInnes also confirmed striker Curtis Main had surgery this week on a knee problem.Main is also scheduled toto pre-season training in mid-July.McInnes is confident both Kennedy and Main will have enough time in training to be ready for the Premiership start on August .He had hoped to get the procedures for both players done earlier, but hospitals had been operating at capacity due to the coronavirus outbreak.The manager said: “Matty had a little procedure on his ankle which was a tidy up.“Due to the way of the world getting hospitals, scans and being seen by specialists was very dficult.“So Matty is a bit behind where we want him to be.“He is doing work with the physios now, but will be up and running in full training the second week of July, which is plenty of time for the season starting.”Kennedy made an immediate impact on signing on at Pittodrie from St Johnstone and became a regular starter for McInnes until football shut-down in March due to the Covid- outbreak.Striker Main, a capture last summer having left Motherwell, took longer to establish himself in the regular staring line-up.That was primarily down to the form of prolic striker Sam Cosgrove, who netted  goals last season,  before the turn of year.However, in the two months before the coronavirus shutdown, Main had established himself as first-choice striker.He netted in the final game before the shutdown, a - defeat of Hibs at Pittodrie on March .McInnes said: “Doing the work we had put to Curtis and the rest of the players, he had felt a little irritation in his knee.“Curtis had a little floating body there that needed clearing out.“Ideally we would have liked to have that done weeks ago, but the way the hospitals were we had to bide our time with that.“The quickest Curtis could get his surgery was Thursday, so he will be out for two to three weeks.“The aim is to be back in full training in the second week of July.”After more than three months apart, Aberdeen ed to socially-distanced training on Monday.McInnes will ease the players into what will be a seven-week pre-season before the targeted August  Premeirship start.He said: “We have to be mindful of the fact that it will be almost five months from the Hibs game to the first the first game of the season.“We also have to be mindful that the players have had a longer break than they have ever had.“What we are trying to do is use the first two weeks to build them up to get them really ready to what they would normally come back for a pre-season.“Then we would use that last month to get them tuned into game-related practices and get more contact.“The players have come back in good condition.“It is great to see everyone again and the players, along with staff, are just enthusiastic about being back onto the grass and in about the work.”Aberdeen remain in talks with Jonny Hayes about trying to negotiate ato Pittodrie for the Republic of Ireland international winger.Hayes, , is a free agent having left Celtic this summer.Aberdeen have offered a two-year-contract to Hayes who starred for the Dons from -

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

New Zealand has achieved much the same with Covid: it had had no new cases at all for  days, until two UK visitors tested positive this week.The lower the prevalence of the virus within the population, the easier it is to pinpoint and contain new clusters, prevent a second wave and allow a fullerto normalityalbeit at a later date.Whatever our progress, Scotland recorded  new cases between May  and June , so eradication is still elusive.: Why the science has no clear-cut answers to Scotlands two-metre dilemmaIn this context, the decision not to re-open beer gardens is all about a better result later: for example, reducing virus prevalence enough that physical distancing can be halved to one metre in time for the hospitality traderesuming on July .Ms Sturgeon said there is emerging evidence that pubs, restaurants and gyms are \"hotspots for transmission\". Japanese research found that the risk of infection is around  times higher indoors than outdoors.So why is it safe to open outdoor food markets but not beer gardens  One theory is that people in beer gardens spend a prolonged period in same company, increasing the risk of transmissionsomeone in the group is infected but not yet showing symptoms.They are also more likely to talk loudly, shout, or even singwhich is also linked to transmission. At two metres, the risk of infection is an estimated % at one metre, %.

However, tidal and wave action continued to drive erosion under the tree roots and actually encouraged erosion.ldquoThese days, the awareness and understanding of the cycles that sand dunes go through ndash and their value as habitats in their own right ndash is much more prevalent so we are looking at how best we can restore sand dunes to their natural state.Sand dunes help to protect the coastline and are likely to be an increasingly important defence against sea level rise as a result of the Climate Emergency.Natural and healthy dune systems change their formation in response to wave, wind and tidal action, with some sand removed only to then be replaced at a later stage with deposits of new sand.This self-sustaining process can play out in the course of one storm but more often occurs over many years and,viewed at a particular moment in the cycle, could give the impression that the dunes are disappearing.Tree planting in previous generations attempted to stop this apparent erosion and fix the dunes in place ndash but it also interrupted the natural process of replenishment, as well as the colonisation of dune vegetation.Ms Dolby said: ldquoPrevious restoration attempts over the last  years have failed to properly restore open dunes because they did not deal with a surface layer on the dunes that had been enriched by fallen leaves or needles, conditions which favour woodland plants and that effectively prevented more sensitive dune plants from surviving.ldquoThe method wersquore trialling now involves removing the trees and scrub and scraping and burying the plant litter layer to leave a bare sand surface, which will hopefully support the rare vegetation special to these dunes.The trial site, at Morrich More, will be closely monitored over the next five years to assess the effectiveness of the restoration process.Scotlandrsquos more than , hectares of sand dune systems are considered among some of the countryrsquos most valuable habitats, thought to support more than  rare species.Risks to the dunes include coner plantations which have already claimed around , hectares and sea buckthorn which has colonised signicant areas of sand dune in parts of south-east Scotland.

Lush brown paper abounding, quality corrugated cardboard cartons here, there and everywhere while grease-proof squares unfold like crisp handkerchiefs to release aromas and textures and finally elicit a collective ooh ndash as freshly-made puff ball meringues sparkling with crimson jus start their transformation into tonightrsquos Eton Mess. And a box of handmade tablet too.Can you feel the relief coursing through me So itrsquos already one of those meals where we set the table properly, lay out the nice place mats, and even use that china found online that restores to full bter the wedding present we got many moons ago from the Evening Times reporters.But what about the food  Classy, really. Pretty elegant. A fennel and orange salad lay out juicy orange slices, sprinkle with fine-sliced yet crunchy fennel, then toss on hazelnuts, pour orange-miso dressing and adorn with very fresh leaves of watercress.After that  Chicken breasts are wrapped in prosciutto and sage leaves, served with slightly seared and still buttery new potatoes flavoured themselves with thyme and rocksalt ndash plus there are courgettes roasted with a crust of parmesan.Itrsquos deftly, and very professionally prepared stuff this. And I suddenly look like a genius for ordering it.Wersquove still to eat those crunchy, gooey meringues with fresh strawberries and fresh raspberries from one of the tubs, whipped cream and a sharp proper raspberry sauce from another. And the tablet is yet to be fought over. Which it will be.Wersquore talking about very generous portions in every course. Four meringues for two people, plates more than adequately filled, not to mention the cost of that expensive packaging.This is the probably the best value meal we have had since the lockdown started. If this is the future of eating out whilst still being in: itrsquos looking very good.Menu: Strictly three-course set menu of fennel and orange salad, chicken saltimbocca with marsala sauce, baby roasts and thyme and, to finish, handmade meringues as part of an Eton mess kit.Price: Itrsquos pound per person or pound for two and that includes free delivery in Glasgow ndash small extra charge outwith the boundaries.Food: Despite being a home-delivery the whole meal sparkled with class and a touch of glamour. The food was prepared to a very high standard ndash therersquos something good happening in lockdown catering.Nosh Night InGlasgow sar@nosh-uk"},{"url":null,"title":"30-years-since-checkpoint-charlie-torn-allies-stopped-going","story":"FIRST, the soldiers moved in. Then the workmen arrived and broke up the ground with jackhammers and laid barbed wire and put up fence posts and painted a six-inch white line across the street. There was also a sign that said DIE GRENZE IST GESCHLOSSEN . It was one of the official crossings from East to West Berlin and the most famous it was Checkpoint Charlie.The first sign of trouble on that night ndash August ,  ndash had been the lights on the Branbenburg Gate going out. Residents then reported hearing the sound of hammering and drilling, and people who were trying to get home on the underground suddenly found they could no longer reach their destination. Others discovered streets and houses sealed off as the barrier entombed them. In years to come, the junction of Friedrichstase and Zimmerstrase ndash Checkpoint Charlie ndash would be one of the few points where some people could still get across.The checkpoint would also become a legendary place, a totem of Eastern totalitarianism and Western defiance , a source of tension, a place of blood and hope. In Western culture, and in spy movies in particular, it also became an icon of espionage and escape. And when it all stopped and the Berlin Wall came down, in , Checkpoint Charlie was one of the focal points of celebration too. People climbed on the wall at the checkpoint and shook hands with the guards and asked for their caps as keepsakes.It is now exactly  years since the day the checkpoint was dismantled and it remains one of the symbolic focal points in the history of the Cold War, only these days it is not the place of solemnity and remembrance you would expect. Quite the opposite in fact: there are tourist shops and burger chains and you can get your photo taken with re-enactors posing as guards and that really gets historians like Iain MacGregor down. Iain is a publisher and writer whose paperback, Checkpoint Charlie: The Cold War, the Berlin Wall and The Most Dangerous Place on Earth, is out this month and one of the first trips he made when he was researching the book was to the place where the checkpoint used to be. It was not what hersquod hoped.ldquoIf you go to Checkpoint Charlie, yoursquod think you were in Leicester Square which is a real shame, he says. ldquoA lot of veterans say they canrsquot believe what it looks like. It is beyond tacky. A much more moving place is the nearby memorial to Peter Fechter, the -year-old German bricklayer who was killed in August  near the checkpoint while trying to get across the wall. Peter was shot in the back by the East German guards and was left lying in no manrsquos land, huddled against the wall. It wasnrsquot the first death there, or the last, but the fact that a young man could be left to die while the guards on both sides looked on shocked the world. Iain laid flowers at the site when he was there.For Iain, the fate of Peter Fechter is one of the stories that emphasises just how terrible the wall and its series of checkpoints were. The famous and notorious name Checkpoint Charlie came from the letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet ndash the checkpoint on the autobahn was Checkpoint Alpha, its counterpart at Drewitz was Bravo, and so on ndash and it was the point where military personnel, diplomats, business people and foreign tourists could cross the wall.Others made escape attempts through or near the checkpoint, one of the most daring of which was in  when boiler workers Peter Schopf and brothers Peter and Manfred Hoer dug a tunnel from a building on the East side to the west. All they had was a shovel, a chisel, a hunting kne and a small tin to remove the earth but, after three gruelling and terrying weeks, they were through and emerged just inside the Western zone near the checkpoint.Iain also talks about the suffering of the families that were ided by the wall. ldquoIf you talk to people who are in their s or s now, he says, ldquowho lived through that moment, when you mention the separation, or meeting their friends or relatives again, they are moved to tears. He talks about the bride, still in her wedding dress, waving to her mother and father in the East. Or the nurse, Ida Siekmann, who could no longer bear being separated from her sister Martha, who lived three streets away in the west. Ida threw three eiderdowns from a building on the border to cushion her landing and threw herself out of the window. She died of her injuries.Then there were the conditions that people in the East had to live under. ldquoItrsquos a classic case of what looked on paper like an amazing experiment in equality,\" says Iain, \" but you get behind that veneer and itrsquos a totalitarian state, no question, and you certainly donrsquot raise your head above the parapet. I went to the places where the people who did rebel were sent and I talked to the people who were sent there and once yoursquove done that, you think as soon as they lost the backing of the Soviet Union by , it was a house of cards that was going to crumble.The nature of le in East Germany is clear from the sheer number of people who were working covertly for the state. ldquoIt was a country of about  million people, says Iain, ldquoand one in four was either a Stasi agent or an informant, and some suggest one in three, and that goes to show what kind of police state it was. And that was before you had -hour news surveillance and electronic satellites ndash it was more to do with people power, people watching, people listening, and people informing. Everyone I spoke to knew of or had a close friend that was an informant. It takes a certain type of person to rebel against that.The tension was also high at the pressure points on the wall, including Checkpoint Charlie and in October  it looked like it might spill over into something more serious when a standoff occurred between US and Soviet tanks on either side of the checkpoint. The spark was a dispute over the examination of travel documents by East German border guards and by the end of the stand-off  tanks were facing each other. Eventually an understanding was reached although some of the military personnel who were there at time think itrsquos the closest we came in Germany to World War Three.Iain MacGregor certainly thinks the incident could have turned extremely nasty. ldquoI think we were on the edge in terms of a localised conflict, although I donrsquot think it would gone global like the Cuban missile crisis. It was all over within hours but it was a very dangerous precedent ndash it got out of hand, there was a very belligerent, senior American general, Lucius Clay, and he overruled the commanders on the ground. He was the one that put the tanks down there but the US only had  tanks in the whole of the city and the Russians had at least . The worldrsquos press was there and thatrsquos when it went back up the chain to the Kremlin and the White House and they managed to talk themselves out of it.What the incident demonstrated was that the real military power lay with the Soviets ndash within the confines of the Wall, the Allies simply could not match the power of the East. But an important question remains about how the Allies handled the situation. Could they have prevented the wall and the checkpoints going up in the first place ldquoI think, at a strategic level, politicians and presidents, they were taken by surprise by the wall going up, says Iain, ldquoRefugees were still pouring in to West Berlin, and these refugees were giving reports of troop build-ups and huge dumps of material, wood and stone and barbed wire, but they were giving these reports in dribs and drabs andsomeone had taken the time to put X, Y and Z together ndash and obviously hindsight is a great thing ndash they might have thought that something was going on.But what about after the barbed wire went down in those first few weeks and the workmen moved into Friedrichstrase to erect the infrastructure at Checkpoint Charlie ndash itrsquos tempting to wonderthe the Allies could have simply pulled down the wire and prevented nearly  years of entombment for Berliners.ldquoI thinktheyrsquod gone straight in and bulldozed the barbed wire down, obviously they would have been taking a massive risk, but the East Germans had discussed that and planned for that, he says. ldquoThey were almost under orders from the Soviets not to match fire with fire and a lot of the East German guards had rles and machines guns that didnrsquot have any bullets in them. Some of them said to the Americans lsquoyou do realise we donrsquot have any bullets  why donrsquot you just pull it down  wersquore not going to stop yoursquo.So in that sense, was that moment when the barbed wire first went down a missed opportunity to prevent the construction of the Berlin Wall  ldquoYes, says Iain, ldquobut yoursquove got to remember that, first, they built the barriers inside their own territory, they werenrsquot stupid, it was a couple of hundred yards inside the Russian zone. President Kennedy had also taken a lot of advice from the doves and the hawks in the White House on the question lsquoshall we knock it down rsquo and what they come down to realise was that as long as theyrsquore not violating the Alliesrsquo right of free access, then there was no basis to knock the barriers down. And Kennedy is famous for saying lsquoa wall is a hell of a lot better than a warrsquo.ldquoHe also had in his mind: what will be their next step ndash theyrsquove done this, perhaps they would go to war over Berlin. And militarily , the US couldnrsquot do anything about it because Berlin is  miles inside the Eastern zone and itrsquos surrounded by around  tanks and half a million Russian troops. So what are we going to do Instead, the Allies waited and watched as the East Germans built grandiose buildings on their side of Checkpoint Charlie. ldquoIf they could, says Iain, ldquothe East Germans would have had the whole of Berlin but that was never going to happen so the next best thing is to say lsquoyou are crossing into a major European country and we take ourselves seriously and wersquore going to spend millions and millions on this state of the art border crossingrsquo when they didnrsquot really need to. Itrsquos your typical Stalinist Communist approach to telling you yoursquore entering a very important place. And it was the exact opposite for the Allies. For them it was a very simplistic cabin just to emphasise to you guys across there that we donrsquot recognise this.By the s, however, behind the grand watchtowers, entropy was beginning to set into the East German state and their Soviet backers. In some of the Eastern Soviet states, democratic protests were growing the economics of the Soviet Union were also looking dodgy and the new guard, led by Mikhail Gorbachev, realised that they could not keep up with the West without being bankrupt the Chernobyl disaster had also cost billions to fix. The new Soviet leadership realised that the writing was on the wall, including the Berlin Wall, and chose not to push back when the pressure started to grow on the ground.Famously, it was on the night of November , , that the wall finally fell and Checkpoint Charlie was one of the epicentres of the peace and celebrations as it had been one of the epicentres of the conflict and Cold War. At least  people crowded round the checkpoint and the side streets near it making it impossible for vehicles to get through. At first, the guards didnrsquot know how to react but as people started to climb on the wall, some of the guards helped them up. Then just after midnight, the dam burst.But, as always happens with history, that moment is not as clear-cut as it looks at first. In some ways the conflict continued, with the Western Allies arguing over whether Germany should be reunited. The fall of the wall also did not lead to the dramatic transformation of East Berlin that many hoped for. The migrations from east Germany to west Germany continue to this day because the standard of living is still much better in the West in. terms of wages and job opportunities . And perhaps most interesting of all: there are some Germans who miss aspects of East Germany. ldquoThe education was really good, healthcare was great, says Iain, ldquobut ultimately there was no political freedom andyou donrsquot have that, you donrsquot have anything.And at Checkpoint Charlie itself, there is a debate about how its past should be remembered. Thirty years on from the day the checkpoint was dismantled on June , , the cityrsquos leaders have unveiled a plan to redevelop the site and build apartments and a new cold war museum, but some believe there should be much more open space where people can gather and debate and reflect. Others, including Iain MacGregor think there are better ways to remember the story of Checkpoint Charlie, which is to walk a few hundred yards to the column of copper that stands on Zimmerstrase. The words on it read: Peter Fechter, -.Checkpoint Charlie: The Cold War, the Berlin Wall and The Most Dangerous Place on Earth by Iain MacGregor is out now."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-local-shops-bouncing-back-supermarkets-stumble-face-coronavirus","story":"Irsquove never met a soul who found supermarket shopping joyous.

Thatrsquos why people are making fewer supermarket shopping trips. They have become an ordeal.And here, in a welcome reversal of fortunes, small shops are coming up trumps, as the recent poll of retail experts conducted by the Grocer Magazine shows. When asked the question ldquoWhich sector stands to benefit most from changing shopper behaviour , convenience shops came romping through at .% with supermarkets and discounterstrailing behind on .% and .% respectively.This is a massive reversal in fortunes.

Whatrsquos more, we intend to spend more with these shops when restrictions are lted, including at butchers , and farmersrsquo markets .So, a small silver lining to covid-: small food outlets are no longer a residual shopping category. On the contrary, they have become essential to their local communities, a flash of hope on depressed high streets. How come  Many people have never got over the initial shock of being unable to set up a supermarket home delivery slot, and our large food retailers have lost customer loyalty as a result. Supermarkets are still struggling to keep up with the demand. Meanwhile small food concerns have set up delivery services and gained customers who didnrsquot use them or even know they existed before.This new customer base for independent food outlets appreciates the more personal service and less frantic shopping experience they offer. Those who do their shopping in person have appreciated the micro-conversations. ldquoHow are you today  ldquoIs your son feeling better  Little human interactions like this do so much to lt our spirits. For those who live alone, local shops might be the only opportunity to speak to a real human being. And that matters so much for our mental health. For many elderly people who dread the very thought of online ordering, the ability to place an order by phone has been a huge relief.Local food businesses have certainly tapped into the sense of community we have craved amid the anxiety of the pandemic. But a cynic would say that once we get back to normal, when le gets busier, most people will revert to supermarket-centric shopping. Will they  The psychological impact of months of lockdown may leave us less inclined to spend time in busy enclosed spaces like shopping malls and supermarkets. Irsquove heard many people saying that they feel safer and happier visiting local shops than the supermarket. Retail analyst James Child believes that that more of us may even be willing to pay a little more to support local stores. ldquoI believe this trend will continue in a post-Covid- UK.Ultimately, when security concerns wane, it wonrsquot be just the shopping experience that matters. Our satisfaction with the food on sale will be pivotal. Big supermarkets typically stock around , dferent lines, but like a subscription to junk TV, itrsquos a quantitative not a qualitative choice. By the time we finally emerge from lockdown, using small local food shops may be a shopping habit that many more of us choose to sustain.

Itrsquos impossible for us to provide full time education in that constraint.But Mr Neil questioned why councils cannot ldquotake a leaf out of the NHSrsquos book after the health service took on more staff and saw an emergency facility set up in case it was needed.He said: ldquoWhat they did was they requisitioned the buildings they needed, they recruited the additional staff they needed.ldquoI agree that has to be paid for by the Scottish Government butyou listen to what the paediatricians are saying ndash the cost of getting your children back to school five days a week in terms of their mental health, their physical health, their education, our future economic prospects ndash all of that is dependent on that happening.He added: ldquoDo you not think the attitude should be, let us not take capacity as a constraint but actually address the capacity issues to make sure we give our children as full time.ldquoWe are looking at the moment asScotland is potentially going to be the only one of the four nations in the UK not planning for or at least trying to get a full timeto school in August.

If the Scottish Government offered councils a blank cheque and said, it doesnrsquot matter what it costs, go out there and double the school estate, get every child back to school full time with face-to-face learning in August, based on two-metre social distancing, we couldnrsquot do it.Scottish Conservative education spokesperson, Jamie Greene, said: ldquoThis is a serious intervention from a former SNP cabinet secretary, who is now saying publicly what many SNP MSPs are thinking privately.ldquoCurrent plans for part-time learning are unworkable and potentially a disaster for children.He added: ldquoAt least Alex Neil has the guts to tell Nicola Sturgeon and his front bench ministers some dficult truths about their lack of ambition and incompetence, adding his name to a growing list of SNP advisers and politicians expressing anger at this shambolic handling of schools.ldquoThe Holyrood committee also learned today of more confusion, with councils admitting that their one and only plan is to only offer a maximum of  per cent attendance in class, in direct contradiction to the First Minister who said that was the contingency plan.

directly inspired the American Declaration of Independence and conclude the myth was actually inspired by a s magazine.The story about the influence of the  Declaration of Arbroath influencing Americarsquos founding fathers in drawing up their  document is described as ldquoone of Scottish historyrsquos most enduring myths.It was even enshrined into American law. In  Republican Senator Trent Lott successfully introduced a motion in Congress that the annual anniversary of the Declaration of Abroath, April , should become National Tartan Day in the US, a celebration of Scottish heritage in America.Mr Lott suggested that ldquoby honouring April , Americans will annually celebrate the true beginning of the quest for liberty and freedom ndash Arbroath and the declaration for liberty.He was referring to the belief the American Declaration of Independence was directly inspired by the Declaration of Arbroath, written by Scottish barons to Pope John XXII, asserting the ancient independence of the Kingdom of Scotland and denouncing English attempts to subjugate it.But a number of scholars have since devoted extensive time to disproving this theory. Among them was American cultural geographer Professor Euan Hague, who examined the sources used by the compilers of the Declaration of Independence, as well as records of their personal libraries, and concluded ldquothe Declaration of Arbroath is conspicuous only by its total absence.Now, Historic Environment Scotland [HES] researcher Dr Laura Harrison claims to have traced the source of the myth to a s magazine. In an HES blog, she said yesterday: ldquoWe have a responsibility to inform our members and visitors about the past with the most accurate and up-to-date information we can.ldquoOne way we approach this is via exploring myth-building, rather than just myth-busting. We identy where an inaccurate myth exists, but we explore how it came to be believed.ldquoOne example of this is a supposed connection between the Declaration of Arbroath and the American Declaration of Independence.ldquoSo where does the myth come from  It appears to be relatively new. The earliest mention I have found is from , when it is mentioned in an American Scottish Clan Societyrsquos members magazine.ldquoSince then it has been mentioned in a number of places on both sides of the Atlantic, from Westminster to an American late-night television show Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.ldquoItrsquos in popular history books and in the Resolution for Tartan Day. Ms Harrison said the myth ldquomay come down to an issue of naming.She said: ldquoFrom about  until relatively recently the Declaration of Arbroath was often called the Scottish Declaration of Independence. Thus, the two perhaps became conflated in peoplersquos minds. Of course, as with all myths, there is an element of truth.ldquoThe Declaration of Arbroath was one of a number of medieval documents that helped contribute to ideas of proto-democracy.

It is not quite fair, however, to accuse the Government of ldquodithering ndash it is weighing up the medical advice, trying to safeguard children and teachers, and essentially keeping in step with the Westminster Governmentrsquos policy, which is certainly no clearer.And in one sense, every policy in this period is a ldquocontingency or,you prefer, an aspiration. Every restriction and relaxation proposed or implemented has been dependent upon circumstances and attended by caveats declaring them subject to cancellation or reversal. That remains the case evenHolyrood and Westminster have both been guilty of misjudgment or inconsistency indeed, errors and their correction are a practically unavoidable part of that process.More decisive thinking, greater clarity and swter action are nonetheless now essential when it comes to education. Without ato something like normal schooling soon, a large section of the workforce will be hamstrung. Even more important is the urgent need to make up the shortfall already created in childrenrsquos education.Despite the stalwart efforts of many teachers, this hiatus has been damaging, and unfortunately the evidence suggests it has had a disproportionate effect on the poorest pupils, and those who for other reasons need the most support. The commitment and sacrice of inidual teachers does not always seem to have been matched by the teaching unions, which have sometimes appeared more anxious to raise objections and reasons for delay than to seek ways of making schoolsrsquo reopening viable. Edinburgh Councilrsquos plans, which could involve cutting provision by two-thirds, are equally unrealistic claiming a need for funding or resources is one thing, but essentially disregarding the future prospects of children for convenience is deplorable.As an entirely devolved issue, it is for the Scottish Government to take the decisions.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing. Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change. Mr Swann stated:“I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. googletag.cmd.push “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people. “It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July. “While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently. googletag.cmd.push “As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health. “Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding. We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Concern was recently raised that Derry City and Strabane District Council ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the local dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. He asked for vehicles using the council-owned recycling centres to be monitored to assess how big an issue it was. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. googletag.cmd.push After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures, which have been seen by the Derry News, revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed last week at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a special meeting of the committee be organised to discuss a number of issues around the recycling centres This included, he said, the dumping of commercial waste at the centres and the number of people from outside the council jurisdiction using the centres. Alderman McCready stressed that he was speaking about anyone from outside the council area, and not just people from Donegal. His proposal was supported by other councillors on the committee. Meanwhile, van drivers who use the local recycling centres are being advised of new arrangements that will come into place from this week. From today, large vans with trailers will only be permitted entry to Strathfoyle and Strahans Road sites during the following revised times - Strathfoyle, between am and am Monday to Saturday, and at Strahans Road between am and am, Monday to Saturday. No large vans with trailers will be accepted at Pennyburn dump. However, large vans will only be permitted access between am and am, Monday to Saturday. A spokesperson for the council said the new arrangements are in place to assist with traffic management arrangements and for safety reasons.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk welcomed the reopening of some sites and said reinstating toilet facilities was ‘imperative’. “It is welcome news to see the reopening of these facilities as a tentative step out of lockdown,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “This will hopefully allow many more people to enjoy the fantastic scenery and outdoor recreational spaces our council area has to offer. “However it is imperative that the toilet facilities which were once at Banagher Glen are reinstated as a matter of urgency. “It is simply not acceptable that other recreational spaces are afforded more amenities than Banagher Glen. “If we hope to attract more tourism to the Dungiven Sperrins area of the Borough we should ensure we offer a world class experience, and that must include basic amenity facilities. “I will be contacting all stakeholders, Council, NI water and Forestry Services, to ensure that they engage with each other to provide the amenities that this recreational space deserves.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The announcement was made today by the Northern Ireland Executive. Churches in the Republic will be reopening around the same time. “It is particularly helpful that parishes in cross-border communities will be able to plan together for a safeto Mass around the same time, said Archbishop Martin. I have been heartened by the amount of preparation which is already ongoing in our parishes to ensure that our sacred spaces will be as safe as possible when we begin to gather again together in prayer. googletag.cmd.push I expect that we will be beginning in a cautious way at first, and there will be a need for ongoing patience and careful monitoring of the situation. “In recent days, having spoken to priests across the dioceses of Armagh and Dromore, it is clear to me that there is a strong desire from our people, religious and priests to be able to celebrate the Eucharist and have access to the other sacraments, especially baptism, marriage and reconciliation. Archbishop Martin commended parishes for reaching out to parishioners in very dficult circumstances during the lockdown which included the broadcasting of Mass and other prayer opportunities by webcam. googletag.cmd.push Since March, we have also been alert to God’s presence in the lonely and the suffering. Sadly the pandemic has brought great hardship to many families whose loved ones have died because of the virus. In a lot of cases it was not possible for family members to be by their side, or to be present at their funeral. God knows our grief and how much we need strength, courage, consolation and comfort at this time”.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town. Killyleagh is fiercely proud of Sir Hans and his achievements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Restoration of emergency services at Downe must be top priority  ","story":"THERE is substantial disquiet within our community concerning the future of the emergency department at Downe Hospital.The time is now long overdue for the South Eastern Trust to confirm that its intention is to restore our emergency department service to its pre-Covid- level and to provide a firm indication of the date on which it believes that that will happen.Clearly, that date cannot be far into the future.Downe Hospital has played a crucial role in the emergency response to the Covid- pandemic. In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The closure of churches is unprecedented in our letimes. Indeed, there are churches that have been open for worship every Sunday for hundreds of years that have now remained empty for months.However, churches are not solely places where people gather for corporate worship one day a week. Across all traditions in Northern Ireland, they are part of the daily lives of people. Prayer meetings, bible studies, children’s meetings, and a whole range of other activities and events take place in them. Many people have had to do without this community and the support that comes with it and this prolonged closure has had a signicant impact on the spiritual and mental wellbeing of many. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

However, there are particular dficulties with people coming together in a church for a prolonged period of time, such as the greater possibility of the mingling of congregants and the risk it could pose to the spread of the disease. However, that risk can be managed and the benefits of reopening the churches would be hugely signicant. That’s why last week the First Minister announced the establishment of a Churches Working Group incorporating Executive Ministers and representatives of dferent faith groups, with the objective of charting a pathway to re-opening. The first meeting of that group took place on Wednesday. It was a really useful engagement and it demonstrated that churches had already put a lot of time and effort into creating comprehensive plans.As a result of their work and the engagement we had with the Chief Medical Officer, the Executive have been able to give an indicative date of th June for churches to reopen. I know churches and faith groups will have a lot of questions about what their services will look like, how many can attend and what measures they will need to have in place. The Churches Working Group will meet again next week so congregations will have clear guidance and time to prepare.It’s obvious though that we will not immediately go back to the way things were.There will be a new normal and there will be a phased approach. Le has changed immensely but I am pleased people will soon be able to meet again with their church families and participate in public worship.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

His report on the Loughinisland massacre did not find collusion in the case but was later quashedNewspapers do not stop corrupt or incompetent things happening but, in western democratic societies, theydo often uncover them. Societies such as China have no independent media scrutiny of events and no fair or independent courts, so will never get on top of problems such as their endemic corruption. Instead the Communist Party is reduced to anti corruption drives, in which officials can be executed.In China, not only is there no free press but there is no free speech or right to protest.The massacre of pro reform students for demonstrating at Tiananmen in  is expunged from history and cannot be commemorated .We don’t even know how many died in Tiananmen: estimates begin in the hundreds. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In the West even a weekly paper with a few reporters can shed light on frauds, planning disputes, etc.A regional daily paper such as this one comes out more often and so can uncover even more.A national paper has still greater resources, and can reveal yet more.In Northern Ireland, the Renewable Heat Incentive saga was, at best, an administrative shambles in which public funds were squandered. The most accessible detailed account of RHI was written by a reporter on thispaper, Sam McBride.This the world’s oldest English language daily title, founded almost  years ago, in . I have read all the earliest surviving - editions, which seem primitive compared to today, yet were revolutionary. Prior to them, news spread by rumour, town crier or pamphlet. The late Jonathan Bardon told me that much of our understanding of King William’s journey to the Boyne to fight the Catholic James II comes from his chaplain’s diary. That  battle was decades before most newspapers. They suddenly provided a single place where key developments could be relayed to the public, at fixed time intervals. From that moment the workings of society became more transparent.The quest to provide news on everything, from war to celebrity to science, is evident in those early News Letters.If you go forward  years and read s editions, they are bigger and better than the s. Society is more advanced, helped by better information.Newspapers have endured ever since, despite falling circulationsin the TV age.Lockdown has not killed papers,but it has caused circulations to fall further. In recent weeks many people have subscribed to us to support our journalism see below how to do so. Among other examples of this paper providing scrutiny to an under examined issue is our querying of the slow theto schools, which we have done for more than a month Also our querying of how the legacy of the Troubles has turned against state forces who prevented civil war. Many people do not accept such a positive assessment of the role of the state, but I thinkmore people do than do not, yet you would never know that from the way legacy is panning out .There is not space here to detail the troubling saga around the handling of complaints about the RUC response to the  Loughinisland loyalist massacre. The murders were a grievous sectarian crime but their horror cannot mean ex RUC are not entitled to due process.Reports on these pages by Mark Rainey and analysis articles have examined the case, It is a complex saga that highlights the sweeping, misleading definition of collusion.The controversy began when the then Ombudsman Al Hutchinson issued a report which did not find collusion in the killings. Dr Michael Maguire, who as criminal justice inspector criticised that report, later became ombudsman. When the first report was quashed, he issued a new one that did find collusion.In , Mr Justice McCloskey was highly critical of the Maguire findings of collusion, as “unsustainable in law”. He said RUC officers “were, in effect, accused, tried and convicted without notice and in their absence. None of the essential elements of the criminal or disciplinary process existed”.It was devastating verdict. But then there was a highly unusual allegation of bias against him, which he firmly rejected, yet stood aside even so . There are grave doubts as to the appropriateness of him recusing himself in that way.Ms Justice Keegan later issued a completely dferent ruling to McCloskey. Wednesday’s appeal court ruling on Loughinisland, while it criticised Dr Maguire overstepping the mark in his collusion findings , does not settle the matter. In this country we have a fine legal system and are free to criticise it, yet papers rarely do, such is the deference to judges. I still believe that the case is so serious that it should to the Supreme Court to get complete clarity as to the legal position. At the same time, in case the case is lost, London must also be ready to act to stop its like ever happening again.The BBC Newsline report on Thursday went big on collusion being upheld, with a brief mention of the over-stepping criticism.We will continue to examine the case and consider the extent to which the security forces can get a fair hearing on legacy matters.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: We also led way in sceptical reporting of slowto schools• Court of Appeal rules Police Ombudsman ‘overstepped the mark’ in Loughinisland findings——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

How long would I survive in the long wait to get in  All questions I never ever had to consider in the past. How times have changed.There was nothing for it but to join the queue – at least it wasn’t raining – and everyone one  seemed civilised and patient. A person not endowed with a lot of patience at the best of times, I gritted my teeth, buttoned up my coat and took my place. Surprisingly, the queue was moving faster than it appeared from the car. An older, grey haired lady joined the queue somewhere behind me. A member of staff, who had obviously sized up those waiting, signalled to the grey haired lady to come forward and she took her ahead of us explaining to the rest of us that anyone  or over gets priority. I told the lady in front – a complete stranger to me - that I was in my th year and I suppose that wouldn’t count. Quick as a flash she hailed the member of staff, still with the grey haired one in tow, and informed her I was in my th year. The staffer said the company had set the age at , but then she must have taken pity on me as she signalled for me to come forward. I thanked my new found benefactor in front of me and headed off, mask and rubber gloves in place. I would like to think all those others in the queue thought that as I didn’t look nearly  why was I getting preference Obviously this lockdown hasn’t deprived me of my vanity when it comes to preferential treatment, but wearing a mask and rubber gloves did upset it somewhat. Inside the store, not that many shoppers were kitted out in the same garb. Is this a sign that everyone is fed up to the teeth with Covid- and are taking a chance that it won’t jump out and bite them when they’ve relaxed their personal security Remembering about the arrows on the floor was dficult as I kept ing off to grab an item I was looking for. But where was the counter for those specialist foods I was after  I’ve starved myself long enough and didn’t plan to go home without something I could eat. Eventually, several arrows later, it came into view. The contents of every item I needed had to be thoroughly read, a task which took time and left me perspiring behind the mask and my glasses steaming up.My spirits rose somewhat when I realised I could get nice things like mousses, biscuits with chocolate,and cakes. I packed the trolley with gluten free pastas and, mercully, they had feta cheese, as all other cheese is right off my menu now. Lockdown or not I wasn’t going to starve or spend nights eating nothing but potatoes and salad without tomatoes, another no-no for me.Himself was greatly impressed when I got home. No more moaning from me about what I can’t eat.Gallantly, he offered to eat the same menu. I think this was due to his idea that he wouldn’t have to do the shopping any longer. But, would he survive eating fake chocolate, chips without the flour, noodles and bread that feels as though it was baked a year ago  I think he would be visiting the chippy a lot.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

You could go to the beach and people’s gardens or meet each other on the road, without much of a risk. People enjoyed that and it was March and April when we generally wouldn’t have been that busy with tourism anyway.’’But Michael, a ferry skipper and current chair of the Rathlin Development Community Association, said it has been a dferent story in May and June - months when the island would normally have welcomed hundreds of tourists every day. ‘‘It is surreal on the island, because now that we have opened up again to limited traffic, people are enforcing all those social distancing measures, they are staying in their houses, so the island is extremely quiet - quieter than I can ever remember it. ‘‘In weather like this we would expect - visitors a day and it’s just not here. It’s strange and some people are quite happy with it because they are enjoying nature and enjoying the island as it should be. But then, anyone who is in tourism is finding it hard financially. A lot of people aren’t working, although thankfully there’s been support through the furlough scheme.’’Rathlin closed to tourists on March , and when it re-opens is still under review, but it is believed it will happen sooner, rather than later. According to Michael, attitudes to re-opening are ided. ‘‘There are polar opposites - people enjoying the quietness and then there are people who don’t enjoy it because of separation and isolation, It’s not been idyllic for everybody. ‘‘There were families that were separated, some people had ended up marooned on the mainland.There were people trying to run businesses and people building houses and finding it extremely dficult. ‘‘The ferry company and ourselves, as a community group, found it was increasingly dficult to try and make a decision on a day-to-day basis on whether an inidual should or shouldn’t be able to travel, because everyone had their case to make or had their own reasons. On an island with such a small population, that can get very personal.’’Michael said it has been particularly dficult for older residents. ‘‘There are quite a few elderly people on the island who live alone. A lot of people would have immediate and extended family on the mainland.’’Getting supplies has been a challenge at times too. ‘‘Groceries are dficult because most times you would go and get your own provisions or order them online,’’ said Michael.‘‘Both of those things are nearly impossible at the minute. Asda and Tesco will deliver to the ferry terminal in Ballycastle, but slots for deliveries are about three weeks in advance. This means more people are shopping locally through our little local shop, which has stayed open throughout, so that has been good for them.’’He added: ‘‘The pub has been closed, which would be a social centre on the island. People are getting a bit fed up with that.’’Rathlin’s two major events have also been cancelled this year - the week-long festival in mid July and the regatta in late August. But, on the plus side, residents are enjoying their natural environment.Rathlin has always been a magnet for nature lovers. The viewpoint at the western lighthouse provides wonderful views of Northern Ireland’s largest colony of seabirds. The cute seals, which drape over rocks, are a big draw for children on the many school trips which visit the island every May and June. During lockdown, Michael said nature has ‘‘exploded’’.‘‘Whether that’s the weather, lack of pollution or lack of tourism, we don’t know. Grass verges aren’t being cut so there’s a lot of wildflowers.‘‘We have quite a big population of Irish hares on the island. In the last few weeks they seem to have taken to exploring the roads, which they would never normally do and they were on the beach last week - nobody has ever seen that.‘‘The seals have stayed at the harbour, which they never normally do. They usually re-locate in the summer months, but they have just stayed there because they’ve not been disturbed or photographed.’’And as for the famous puffins, the are ‘‘just getting on with le’’.‘‘They are probably wondering where everybody is and what they’ve done wrong,’’ laughed Michael.Noel McCurdy is Rathlin’s postman and also looks after two of the lighthouses. He described the weeks in lockdown as ‘‘heaven’’, but recognises it has been a challenging time for the island’s businesses. ‘‘A lot of elderly people I would speak to on my rounds are happy that we have escaped the virus and are quite happy that we stay in lockdown. ‘‘We were able to go out for a walk and you didn’t see anybody. It was great. You would see a lot of orchids growing along the roadside. Sometimes the tourists would have picked them, which you aren’t supposed to do.‘‘But I know the businesses on the island have missed the tourists, because it’s their livelihood, so I can understand them wanting the tourists back.’’Noel believes there will be a surge in daytrippers to the island when lockdown is lted. ‘‘I think a lot of people will not necessarily want to travel abroad. The North Coast will do well out of it. I’ve no doubt we will recover.’’\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...However, internal company documents which have only now been released by the RHI Inquiry as part of a vast document dump of evidence, show that not only was the company financially benefiting from RHI in multiple ways, but senior company figures were aware of that.That seems to explain why the company urged its farmers to enter the -year scheme, and why it lobbied to keep RHI open even when the scheme’s budget had been blown to an extent that it was having to be funded by Stormont taking money from other public services.In one internal email a senior Moy Park manager described the environmental aspects of moving to biomass boilers as “literally ‘window dressing’” which “plays almost no part in the objectives of the project”.Moy Park – which supplies chicken sold by major supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and MS – did not want sections of many of the documents to be released and watermarked it with the word ‘REDACT’, but the inquiry chose to publish much of it with minimal, or no, sections being blacked out.Senior Moy Park manager David Mark giving evidence at the RHI InquiryRead More Read MoreAfter RHI, Moy Park CEO salary shot up % to £. millionWhen Moy Park was asked by the News Letterit accepted that its denial of having received any indirect financial benefit from RHI was now untenable, the company simply said: “Moy Park’s position has been clearly stated and is in the public domain.”There is no suggestion that Moy Park was acting illegally, or that it was encouraging abuse of the scheme. And in a capitalist system it would be entirely natural for a company to seek to make as much money as possible.The company, which supplies % of all UK chicken, had four boilers of its own, but its farmers have between them % of the boilers on the scheme.One of those farmers testied that while it appeared to the public that they were making huge sums from RHI, Moy Park’s complex pricing structure meant that much of that money ultimately – in an indirect way – ended up with the company and in the bank accounts of its US parent company Pilgrim’s Pride, which is ultimately owned by vast Brazilian meat packer JBS.Among tens of thousands of pages of evidence which has now been released by the RHI Inquiry are multiple internal company emails which show that the lucrative RHI payments to its farmers helped it to rapidly expand its business by funding better heating systems for poultry houses.Moy Park was able to cut the sum which it paid its farmers as an expense for their heat, in the knowledge that most of those farmers were getting the huge RHI payments.The documents show that Moy Park was alive to the financial potential of RHI from just months after the scheme launched in November  – a far earlier stage than previously thought – and undertook detailed financial analysis before deciding on its strategy.In a  email just nine months after RHI had been launched, Moy Park’s Group Energy and Resource Manager, John Kennedy, said to senior executive Mike Mullan that a risk assessment on biomass for the company was being prepared.He went on to set out – and financially quanty – the benefits to Moy Park. Referring to RHI payments for biomass boilers, he said there would be a dry litter benefit to the company of £, a year, a food conversion rate benefitof £,, carbon payment savings of about £, a year, and energy bill savings of £. million a yearthe company moved to one model of rolling out RHI .Mr Kennedy also said there would be intangible benefits to the company of reduced pododermatitis and hock burn – two conditions which can afflict poultry crammed into huge houses where the floor area is damp with their own faeces, something the RHI boilers helped reduce by lowering humidity.Mr Mullan responded: “Great”. Mr Mullan went on to say that “you will need to show financial models in this”, showing that the company – which is known for its minute attention to financial detail in a sector where margins are slim – was from the outset acutely aware of, and studying closely, the financial implications of what it was doing.The following year, Mr Kennedy expressed scepticism about going for biomass and suggested sticking with gas-fired heating systems.In another indication that the company was paying close attention to the costs involved, he said: “It is important to note the farmer will not receive the RHI payments but the capital will be lower. As stated, this requires further analysis to determine the best way forward for Moy Park.”In the same email to a colleague, he said bluntly: “It strikes me that the decarbonisation aspect is literally ‘window dressing’ and plays almost no part in the objectives of the project.”In a November  email to other senior managers – just a year after RHI had been launched – Moy Park’s head of agriculture growth projects, David Mark, made explicit that the company was urgently trying to get its farmers to enter RHI.He said: “We have to get a flyer out for the next farmers meeting targeted to existing growers to encourage them to actively consider the opportunity to move to renewables NOW. Specially [sic] explaining the % AHP [company support] on Hot Water Heating coupled with the RHI on Biomass Boilers”.Setting out figures, he said that RHI could see the boilers paid off within four years – with RHI payments for another  years – and referred to the way the boilers were installed having to be “managed so as not to loose [sic] RHI”.In an April  email to Moy Park manager Paul Longstaff, Mr Mark referred to a project which the company was considering and said: “The ability of Moy Park to leverage the RHI on this model is for me a signicant factor to make this very attractive”.Two days before Christmas , and just a month after the end of the spike – much of it from Moy Park’s farmers – which had crippled the scheme before the ‘cash for ash’ tarf was ended, the company’s director of agriculture, David Gibson, emailed Moy Park’s key RHI figure, David Mark, to relay information he had received from a source which he did not disclose.He said that the RHI scheme would be made even less lucrative within three months and that the budget was moving to Stormont. Five days earlier Arlene Foster’s spad, Andrew Crawford – who the inquiry noted was very close to the firm and would go on to alert it to looming closure – had been told that Stormont was going to have to pay for the entirety of the overspend.Mr Gibson said that question of whether to implement an “aggressive reduction” in tarfs was “a political decision not yet made” and added bluntly: “Our view is go for as much as you can before March”.David Mark said at the inquiry that his “prime motivation” in trying to rush poultry farmers into RHI before the cash for ash tarfs were stopped was not to benefit the multinational company for which he worked, but to help the farmers.After the scheme had closed and as the company considered how to respond to questions from BBC Spotlight in November , Mr Mark gave an insight into the gargantuan sums involved. In an email to Moy Park’s PR advisers, he said that he believed Moy Park’s farmers were in line to receive “rough income over  years [of] c£ million”. That has now been slashed because of the cuts to RHI tarfs.Just before the RHI scandal erupted in December , Moy Park privately told Stormont that RHI was “of immense value” to it, according to a note of a meeting.In a Department of Agriculture document in February , Ruth Galwey, the then private secretary to DUP Agriculture Minister Michelle McIlveen, referred to a comment at the minister’s meeting with Moy Park five months earlier.She said: “In relation to RHI Moy Park representatives expressed support for the scheme, saying it was of immense value. They were keen to see a continuation of the scheme as the scheme in GB was still available and this created a disadvantage for [poultry] growers in Northern Ireland. They recognised that the scheme benefits were a reduction in antibiotic use, a good quality environment to grow birds, and a reduction in campylobacter”.The RHI Inquiry did not criticise Moy Park or other companies which had taken advantage of the riches on offer, saying that “it would have been unrealistic to expect the commercial market to act altruistically in relation to a commercially attractive scheme such as the NI RHI.”A spokesperson for Moy Park said: “Having participated fully with the inquiry process, we welcomed the publication of its report in March which found no fault with the company’s use of the RHI scheme. Its findings and recommendations were not directed towards the business.”*** For more revelations from the Moy Park files, see Monday’s News Letter.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccaddbdcfddbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccfdffefeadee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
