Pictured:  The couple together on the set of Hooper in 1978              The Oscar-winning actress (pictured on Monday) has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died on September 6 aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoirField has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died earlier this month aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoir. And now that the book is out, it is clear what she meant.Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14.Field describes how being with Reynolds was \u0027exorcising something that needed to be exorcised\u0027 but she was \u0027trying to make it work this time\u0027.The actress writes that from the beginning Reynolds was presumptuous and arrogant, introducing himself as \u0027Burt Reynolds, movie star\u0027 when he called her. It was 1976 and he had asked her to star in Smokey and the Bandit she had already found fame with films like Gidget and Stay Hungry, while Reynolds was the biggest star in the world at the time, thanks to films like Deliverance.Field writes she did not understand why Reynolds wanted her in the film because she was not his typical leading lady and she thought that the \u0027script stinks\u0027.But his motives became clear when, to her surprise, he announced they were going on a date for their first meeting.Field writes: \u0027By the time we met, the weight of his stardom had become a way for Burt to control everyone around him, and from the moment I walked through the door, it was a way to control me. We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.          Field learned not to talk about previous lovers and later became \u0027terrified\u0027 of running into any man she knew, regardless of whether or not she was in a relationship with him priorDuring the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.Field writes: \u0027This could not have been a good thing and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone around him acted so nonchalant while this man was writhing in pain, panicked that his heart was about to stop\u0027.Field gave Reynolds a brown paper bag to breathe into and wrapped hot towels around his feet, face and hands. Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist. Clearly I didn\u0027t have my wits about me\u0027.\u0027This would hurt him\u0027: Sally Field is relieved that Burt...Sally Field reveals she was repeatedly sexually abused by...Hidden agony of America\u0027s sweetheart: Sally Field was abused...\u0027It was instantaneous, four days felt like four years\u0027:...Share this articleHis episodes led Field to take Reynolds to the Miami Heart Institute for a checkup on his heart, which came back all clear.Reynolds dismissed her attempts to get him into therapy for his anxiety, which she thought was causing his heart palpitations, because he thought it was \u0027self-delusional poppycock\u0027.But Reynolds thought that drugs could cure Field\u0027s health issues, and when she had a headache he offered her a strong Percodan.When she asked for an aspirin instead, his voice turned to irritated impatience, which Field calls his \u0027how dare you doubt my know-how\u0027 tone.Field says the message he was sending her was \u0027do it now, go!\u0027 so she took the pill and felt sick with her heart pounding.           Reynolds dismissed her attempts to get him into therapy for his anxiety, which she thought was causing his heart palpitations, because he thought it was \u0027self-delusional poppycock\u0027          Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.As the months went by Reynolds became \u0027louder, short-tempered and impatient,\u0027, she writes. Field was doing all the cooking and cleaning in his Los Angeles home, buying things and \u0027fulfilling every wish before he could even wish for it\u0027.She was paying for everything out of her own pocket but when she finally got up the courage to ask Reynolds for some money, he refused.He said: \u0027My business manager gives me only a thousand dollars a week. If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/14/50214AD000000578-6180733-image-a-14_1537277545387.jpg","title":"Midterms 2018 need know November elections","story":"    The fate of the U.S. Congress hangs in the balance as the 2018 midterm elections loom largeWhat are midterm elections?Midterm elections in the United States are elections held on a quadrennial basis every four years during the midpoint of a U.S. President’s four-year office term.In the United States, all 50 states receive two Senate seats irrespective of their population for a total of 100 seats while the 435 House of Representatives seats are delegated based on population, with a larger state such as California receiving far more representation in the chamber than states with much smaller populations like Wyoming, Vermont and Delaware.All 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives are contested in midterm elections, while 33 to 34 Senate seats out of 100 total are also up for grabs, meaning that midterm elections can have a major impact on which party controls Congress.Midterm elections also have a key impact on state and local level politics, as 36 out of the 50 governorships in the U.S. hold elections during the midterms while many mayoral elections are also held throughout the U.S.Historically, turnout for midterm elections in the United States has been lower than presidential elections, with roughly 40 percent of eligible voters going to the polls as opposed to 50 to 60 per cent for presidential elections.In addition, the President’s party typically loses seats during most midterm elections, with notable examples being the ‘Republican Revolution’ of 1994 in which the Republican Party took control of Congress and the 2006 midterm elections, which saw the Democrats seize control of both houses of Congress in what was seen as a major rebuke to former President George W. Bush.In the United States, more rural areas tend to favor the Republican Party while more urban, erse areas typically favor the Democratic Party.When are the 2018 midterm elections?The 2018 midterm elections will be held on Tuesday, November 6.          The election will soon have a major impact on political issues like taxes, immigration and moreSenateThe Republicans currently hold a narrow 51 seat majority in the Senate and are facing strong headwinds, though have one clear advantage: the Democrats will be on the defensive. The Democratic Party is currently defending 26 seats while the Republican Party is only defending nine, possibly giving them an edge going into the election.The Senate will see a number of key elections to watch closely as the 2018 midterms draw near.One key race is in Arizona for the seat held by the late Senator John McCain, which is currently being targeted by the Democrats for a potential pickup. Republican candidate Martha McSally is thought to face a tough challenge from Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema.The state’s shifting demographics, notably its large and growing Latino population, and isions between traditional Republicans like McCain and pro-Trump populists have threatened to weaken the Republicans’ long-held grip on the state.Other key Senate races to keep an eye on include a surprisingly competitive race between sitting Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke, who only narrowly trails Cruz according to most polls in the traditionally-Republican state.In Nevada, Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Dean Heller are locked in a tight race, as are Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrat Phil Bredesen and Republican Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, another traditionally-Republican state.In Florida, one of the most famous bellwether states in the U.S., the race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Rick Scott is also extremely competitive.House of RepresentativesThough the Republicans currently control the House of Representatives, the Democrats are seen as having a strong chance to retake the congressional chamber, needing 24 seats to gain majority control of it.Republicans currently hold 240 seats compared to 195 for the Democrats.However, over the past 50 years, the Democrats have only gained more than 24 seats twice: in 1974, in the wake of the infamous Watergate scandal, and in 2006, when opposition to former President George W. Bush over the Iraq War reached a fever pitch.Fortunately for the Democrats, a record 39 sitting Republicans in the House of Representatives have opted to not seek reelection, giving them a chance to pick up seats in many states, including longtime swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida.A key race to watch closely is in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, where Democrat Conor Lamb stunned observers to win a special election in March 2018 for a seat that had been held by Republicans from 2003 to 2017 and was considered to be in Trump-friendly territory.Lamb will now be facing off against Republican Keith Rothfus after court-ordered redistricting in a new district that’s thought to be considerably friendlier to the Democrats.          Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke is putting up a very strong challenge against Texas Senator Ted Cruz GovernorsKey races are also slated to get underway at the gubernatorial level as Democrats and Republicans face off in key swing states like Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Colorado.Republicans currently hold 33 governorships, although the Democrats are looking to build on their anticipated momentum and make gains at the state level as well as in Congress.A key race to watch is in Florida, as Democrat Andrew Gillum, fresh off an upset victory in the primaries, is looking to become the first African-American to become governors of the state. The outspoken progressive and Tallahassee mayor will face off against Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a vocal proponent of Donald Trump’s policies.Other notable races to watch closely include competitive elections in Georgia, where Democrat Stacy Abrams is looking to become the first African-American woman to win a gubernatorial race in the U.S. as she faces off against Republican Brian Kemp and in the swing state of Iowa, where Republican Kim Reynolds is locked in a tight battle with Democrat Fred Hubbell.2018 midterm election predictionsThough the 2018 midterm election is still several weeks away, both historical and current trends have helped pollsters and election prognosticators draw up what they believe is a likely scenario for the outcome of the election.Given the fact that the sitting President’s party generally loses seats in midterm elections and President Donald Trump is hobbled by fairly low approval ratings, many election forecasters believe that the upcoming election will produce strong results for the Democrats and favor them taking at least one house of Congress, both of which are currently controlled by the Republicans.According to FiveThirtyEight, the Senate has a more than 67 percent chance to remain in Republican hands as of September 17. This is largely due to the fact that the Democrats have to defend a much wider range of seats during the election, including ones in states won by Trump in the 2016 election.Having to defend so many seats could blunt the ‘blue wave’ that many election forecasters have predicted for the Democrats and possibly leave the Senate in Republican control, though many races are thought to be especially competitive and could easily swing one way or another.The Democrats are thought to have much better odds in the House of Representatives, where FiveThirtyEight is forecasting the Democrats’ chances of retaking the chamber of more than 82 percent as of September 17.Although the Republicans currently have a solid majority of 240 seats, the Democrats have a clear historical advantage and are also buoyed by strong and persistent opposition to Trump, meaning that their odds of retaking the chamber are considerably higher than in the Senate.Playing For Keeps: All you need to know about the new Network Ten TV seriesPrince George\u0027s latest obsession revealed by father Prince WilliamNational lottery numbers: Results for Wednesday September 19Julie Chen\u0027s net worth revealed as Les Moonves\u0027s wife confirms she\u0027s staying on as Big Brother hostAmerica\u0027s Got Talent 2018 winner: Who is expected to take home the grand prize?International Talk Like a Pirate Day 2018: All you need to knowWho is Orla Kiely?

Nobody really understood what I was doing or wanted, and they were like, “That’s crazy – I would never go on camera and say that”.‘But if you’re there – and I’d say I was there three days a week probably for four years – you’re around (not that I stayed at the hotel, but I was around the hotel, in the lobby and getting to know people.) And once you’ve become familiar, people open up, and they tell you stories off-camera – and then they agree to go on camera.’And some of the people he got to agree to interviews are more than familiar with being in front of – or even behind – the lens: box office names like Naomi Campbell, George Clooney, Harrison Ford, Jon Hamm, Anjelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones, Lenny Kravitz, and Wes Anderson all happily shared their experiences at the hotel, good-naturedly bantering about the place, the staff and the Carlyle’s embodiment of an old-world class that is so quickly disappearing in today’s society.‘It has a unique, unique heritage,’ designer Vera Wang says in the film. ‘As a native New Yorker, there’s really nothing that is more emblematic of elegance, history, romance, scandal than the Carlyle.’The late Anthony Bourdain – who Miele believes died before seeing the finished film – similarly gushes: ‘I stay in many different type of hotels, and I’m reasonably happy in a lot of them, but we’re talking about love like someone you fall in love with, it’s the eccentricities you embrace as much as everything, if not more so.’He later adds: ‘It’s like you’re holding your breath: How much longer can this exist? It’s completely awesome and frankly nuts.’The staff discuss the hotel with a mixture of pride and reverence, whether a doorman named Ernesto is explaining how Jack Nicholson, one of the favorite guests, refused to pose for paparazzi unless the doorman joined him in the pic – or elevator operator Allen laughing about how he was once cast as the lead in an off- off-Broadway play in which Bruce Willis was an extra (the story made for an amusing exchange when Willis and his family stepped into the elevator Allen was operating.)    Another long-time guest is George Clooney, who happily shares his memories of and fondness for the hotel in filmmaker Matthew Miele\u0027s documentary Always at The Carlyle, revealing that his wife, Amal, loves the hotel, as well  Celebrities such as Rihanna, left, and Priyanka Chopra, right, flock to The Carlyle each year on the evening of the Met Gala the hotel is a hopping after-party location for the eventEvery president since Truman has visited the Carlyle, and one of the now-retired bartenders - who began working at the hotel in 1958 – recalls on film how Truman was one of his first customers. John F. Kennedy was rumored to have slipped Marilyn Monroe in through a network of tunnels. Donald J. Trump, one cheeky bellman named Danny concedes after significant prodding, allegedly once disparaged the Carlyle, sniffing: ‘This place is a joke’. It’s about the only twinge of negativity in the documentary, which even interviews the children of a former manager who spent their youth growing up at the Carlyle and Donald Ginsburg, the grandson of builder Moses Ginsburg, who conceived of the hotel in 1930.‘My grandfather included his daughters in everything he did, even though the women never worked in the business,’ Ginsburg says in the film, adding that his aunt Diana chose the hotel’s name because she was reading and enjoying Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle.The Carlyle enjoyed its upsurge in popularity under the ownership of hotelier Peter Sharp, who bought the property in 1967 and whose family were real estate magnates in the city.‘My dad recognized that there was a need, at that time, that people who were coming to New York who were socially connected, as well as connected in business, didn’t want to stay down at the St Regis,’ his son, also named Peter, says in the film. ‘They didn’t want to stay at the Plaza, which was a zoo. They were usually here for relatively long periods of time, and they wanted to stay where their friends lived – and the Carlyle really became their second home.’He praises his father’s attention to and insistence on detail, saying: ‘I did learn that, the ability to walk into a room – it’s almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room. My dad could do that in spades. He would say … this was imbued into us: “Even though the guest doesn’t see it, they see it.”’           In addition to being an iconic feature of the Manhattan skyline, the hotel became an alternative to busier establishments such as the St. Moritz or Plaza hotels, the son of former owner Peter Sharp says in the documentary, adding that his father was \u0027almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room. My dad could do that in spades.

Entertainment has included everyone from long-time performer Bobby Short to Eartha Kitt to, more recently, Alexa Ray Joel, daughter of Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley, and Woody Allen, who regularly plays clarinet at the establishment.The ambience and artistry at the hotel even inspired a new generation of talent, as revealed by Lenny Kravitz – in yet another Carlyle connection of which the filmmakers were completely unaware before the project began.‘I’ve been coming to the Carlyle since I was about three or four years old,’ Kravitz says on camera he grew up just blocks away from the hotel and his parents were very friendly with Bobby Short.‘I was brought to this room as a small child, made to put on a suit, which I didn’t like, as I remember it was very itchy. And I used to sit in this room and listen to Bobby Short,’ he says. ‘I didn’t really get it, and you’re in a room full of adults and it’s quiet it’s dark … but one day, I got it. I understood it, and I fell in love with Bobby and this room.’He says: ‘This would be a place where I would bring a date, like: Let me see if this girl can hang, if she understands this and enjoys it. And if I brought a girl here and she liked it, it was very major for me.’He later adds: ‘It’s definitely been a fantasy of mine to be on this stage and to grace this institution … not yet, but it’ll happen.’Filmmaker Wes Anderson, for once on the other side of the camera, says in his interview that he, too, equates the Carlyle with dating.‘The first time I came to the Carlyle, it was to Bemelmans Bar,’ he says. ‘I actually was on a date, and I’d been told to go here – and I think it made me look good.

Pictured, the Earl of Pembroke leaving Whitby Harbour in 1768It was sent out to explore the Pacific Ocean in August 1768 both to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun and in the search for the continent which was then called Terra Australis Incognita, or unknown Southern land.The previous transit of Venus in 1639 had provided a vast amount of the information astronomers and scientists had about the size of the solar system and universe. The ship departed from Plymouth with 94 people on board, including Captain James Cook.It traveled down the coast of Africa before cutting across the Atlantic and arriving in Rio de Janeiro in November of that year.The boat then set out to round Cape Horn, which it managed to do on its third attempt in January after wind, stormy weather and difficult conditions foiled Cook\u0027s first two attempts.          Captain James Cook is pictured arriving at Queen Charlotte\u0027s Sound in New Zealand, in this A print from an oil painting attributed to J Clevely In April the ship reached Tahiti, where it stayed for the next four months and where astronomer Charles Green was able to study the transit of Venus in June.After months exploring the Pacific for islands, the Endeavour reached the coast of New Zealand in October, becoming the first European vessel to land on the island in over 100 years.Dutch explorer Abel Tasman had previously reached the islands of New Zealand and Tasmania during his 1642 journey while with the Dutch East India Company.Cook spent six months exploring and mapping the coast of New Zealand and claimed the land for Great Britain before sailing west.In April of 1770 iniduals on the ship first spotted Australia, and on April 29 the HMS Endeavour became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of the island.Cook spent four months charting the coast and at one point ran into trouble when the ship struck part of the Great Barrier Reef.The ship was 24 miles off the coast at the time with not enough life boats, but managed to clear the water from the hull of the ship and make its way safely back to shore.

And if I run at top speed, there\u0027s a high likelihood I will fall down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Tom Cruise. \u0027Mission: Impossible\u0027 - he ran across London, across bridges, over buildings. Yeah, Tom is a great runner. He did all his own jumping, he was flying the helicopter, he really was like - oh, if there\u0027s a question of whether or not I\u0027m the best at this, let me put that question to bed. He\u0027s the best.\u0027But it was Cruise\u0027s reputation that Pratt said he most admired.          The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state          Pratt has erected crosses on his land \u0027One of the career goals that I have based on Tom Cruise is his reputation as being a really nice, positive guy who works hard. I\u0027ve never actually met him, but I would like - if you\u0027re going to leave a legacy, it\u0027d be nice to have it be that people thought you were nice and easy to work with and you worked hard. I think that\u0027s pretty cool.\u0027Prat split from his wife Anna Faris last year, but has found love again in Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28.They came out as a couple in June and have been spotted enjoying a sunny Saturday day in Los Angeles last weekend.Proving that couple that exercises together stays together, they enjoyed a walk. At one point the beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver reached out to lovingly stroke her beau\u0027s arm. Chris and Katherine are reportedly serious, a source dished to People, even though they\u0027ve only been together a few months \u0027They\u0027re both serious about the relationship and hopeful for the future,\u0027 the source revealed. \u0027Chris doesn\u0027t just date to date, and neither does Katherine. She\u0027s very excited.\u0027 They were set up by her mom Maria, according to the source.The actor split from wife Anna Faris in August 2017 after being married for eight years and they share six-year-old son Jack.  He filed for orce on December 1, nearly four months after they announced their legal separation. Three days later Anna filed her nearly identical response. They both cited irreconcilable differences and requested joint legal and physical custody of their son, according to E!

Nobody really understood what I was doing or wanted, and they were like, “That’s crazy – I would never go on camera and say that”.‘But if you’re there – and I’d say I was there three days a week probably for four years – you’re around (not that I stayed at the hotel, but I was around the hotel, in the lobby and getting to know people.) And once you’ve become familiar, people open up, and they tell you stories off-camera – and then they agree to go on camera.’And some of the people he got to agree to interviews are more than familiar with being in front of – or even behind – the lens: box office names like Naomi Campbell, George Clooney, Harrison Ford, Jon Hamm, Anjelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones, Lenny Kravitz, and Wes Anderson all happily shared their experiences at the hotel, good-naturedly bantering about the place, the staff and the Carlyle’s embodiment of an old-world class that is so quickly disappearing in today’s society.‘It has a unique, unique heritage,’ designer Vera Wang says in the film. ‘As a native New Yorker, there’s really nothing that is more emblematic of elegance, history, romance, scandal than the Carlyle.’The late Anthony Bourdain – who Miele believes died before seeing the finished film – similarly gushes: ‘I stay in many different type of hotels, and I’m reasonably happy in a lot of them, but we’re talking about love like someone you fall in love with, it’s the eccentricities you embrace as much as everything, if not more so.’He later adds: ‘It’s like you’re holding your breath: How much longer can this exist? It’s completely awesome and frankly nuts.’The staff discuss the hotel with a mixture of pride and reverence, whether a doorman named Ernesto is explaining how Jack Nicholson, one of the favorite guests, refused to pose for paparazzi unless the doorman joined him in the pic – or elevator operator Allen laughing about how he was once cast as the lead in an off- off-Broadway play in which Bruce Willis was an extra (the story made for an amusing exchange when Willis and his family stepped into the elevator Allen was operating.)    Another long-time guest is George Clooney, who happily shares his memories of and fondness for the hotel in filmmaker Matthew Miele\u0027s documentary Always at The Carlyle, revealing that his wife, Amal, loves the hotel, as well  Celebrities such as Rihanna, left, and Priyanka Chopra, right, flock to The Carlyle each year on the evening of the Met Gala the hotel is a hopping after-party location for the eventEvery president since Truman has visited the Carlyle, and one of the now-retired bartenders - who began working at the hotel in 1958 – recalls on film how Truman was one of his first customers. John F. Kennedy was rumored to have slipped Marilyn Monroe in through a network of tunnels. Donald J. Trump, one cheeky bellman named Danny concedes after significant prodding, allegedly once disparaged the Carlyle, sniffing: ‘This place is a joke’. It’s about the only twinge of negativity in the documentary, which even interviews the children of a former manager who spent their youth growing up at the Carlyle and Donald Ginsburg, the grandson of builder Moses Ginsburg, who conceived of the hotel in 1930.‘My grandfather included his daughters in everything he did, even though the women never worked in the business,’ Ginsburg says in the film, adding that his aunt Diana chose the hotel’s name because she was reading and enjoying Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle.The Carlyle enjoyed its upsurge in popularity under the ownership of hotelier Peter Sharp, who bought the property in 1967 and whose family were real estate magnates in the city.‘My dad recognized that there was a need, at that time, that people who were coming to New York who were socially connected, as well as connected in business, didn’t want to stay down at the St Regis,’ his son, also named Peter, says in the film. ‘They didn’t want to stay at the Plaza, which was a zoo. They were usually here for relatively long periods of time, and they wanted to stay where their friends lived – and the Carlyle really became their second home.’He praises his father’s attention to and insistence on detail, saying: ‘I did learn that, the ability to walk into a room – it’s almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room. My dad could do that in spades. He would say … this was imbued into us: “Even though the guest doesn’t see it, they see it.”’           In addition to being an iconic feature of the Manhattan skyline, the hotel became an alternative to busier establishments such as the St. Moritz or Plaza hotels, the son of former owner Peter Sharp says in the documentary, adding that his father was \u0027almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room.

Entertainment has included everyone from long-time performer Bobby Short to Eartha Kitt to, more recently, Alexa Ray Joel, daughter of Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley, and Woody Allen, who regularly plays clarinet at the establishment.The ambience and artistry at the hotel even inspired a new generation of talent, as revealed by Lenny Kravitz – in yet another Carlyle connection of which the filmmakers were completely unaware before the project began.‘I’ve been coming to the Carlyle since I was about three or four years old,’ Kravitz says on camera he grew up just blocks away from the hotel and his parents were very friendly with Bobby Short.‘I was brought to this room as a small child, made to put on a suit, which I didn’t like, as I remember it was very itchy. And I used to sit in this room and listen to Bobby Short,’ he says. ‘I didn’t really get it, and you’re in a room full of adults and it’s quiet it’s dark … but one day, I got it. I understood it, and I fell in love with Bobby and this room.’He says: ‘This would be a place where I would bring a date, like: Let me see if this girl can hang, if she understands this and enjoys it. And if I brought a girl here and she liked it, it was very major for me.’He later adds: ‘It’s definitely been a fantasy of mine to be on this stage and to grace this institution … not yet, but it’ll happen.’Filmmaker Wes Anderson, for once on the other side of the camera, says in his interview that he, too, equates the Carlyle with dating.‘The first time I came to the Carlyle, it was to Bemelmans Bar,’ he says. ‘I actually was on a date, and I’d been told to go here – and I think it made me look good. I actually didn’t know the place, but when I walked in, I thought: This is good. This is a good idea.’He adds: ‘I really spent most of my time kind of creeping around the room, leaning over people’s martinis, staring at these walls. And I thought, I know this artist, but I didn’t know the name.’Is this the best hotel room on the east coast of America?...No wonder the WAGs love it!

A cutaway painting of Captain Cook\u0027s HMS Endeavour ship during its famous voyage of discovery          The HMS Endeavour was first launched in 1764 as the Earl of Pembroke. Pictured, the Earl of Pembroke leaving Whitby Harbour in 1768It was sent out to explore the Pacific Ocean in August 1768 both to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun and in the search for the continent which was then called Terra Australis Incognita, or unknown Southern land.The previous transit of Venus in 1639 had provided a vast amount of the information astronomers and scientists had about the size of the solar system and universe. The ship departed from Plymouth with 94 people on board, including Captain James Cook.It traveled down the coast of Africa before cutting across the Atlantic and arriving in Rio de Janeiro in November of that year.The boat then set out to round Cape Horn, which it managed to do on its third attempt in January after wind, stormy weather and difficult conditions foiled Cook\u0027s first two attempts.

Dixon said her parents were so keen on renovations to her childhood home on the Isle of Man that she \u0027grew up on a building site\u0027. Bühler, meanwhile, used his architectural expertise to draw up the designs. By the end of their work they had a long, open-plan ground floor with a 22ft-wide kitchen-diner area illuminated by two huge skylights and four ceiling-height sliding windows. The kitchen, which like the rest of the property has walnut floors,  features marble worktops and a French range and mirror. Upstairs there are four bathrooms in addition to a downstairs loo.A drafty, non-secured side alley was replaced with a larder and a wine room to take advantage of the cool temperatures in that part of the house.            The couple are pictured with their children, Forest and Vada, further towards the front of the house, which contains the living room in an open-plan format           There are four bathrooms in the upstairs of the house, in addition to a downstairs loo. This bathroom is decorated with several modern artworks, much like many rooms in the property   Dixon and Bühlerand made use of the high 8.2-feet ceilings to lend an airy aspect to the property.

It is a stark contrast to the previous set up of seven bedsits Meanwhile, the previously overgrown backyard with a pond full of frogs has been replaced with a Mediterranean-style garden.The couple met at architecture school and have already renovated several properties in the local area, some of which they rent out.\u0027We are really happy with it, it\u0027s a great space to live in,\u0027 Dixon said. Even though it\u0027s very big each area is zoned to make it more liveable. \u0027So even though the downstairs is vast it is broken up into a reading area, sitting room and kitchen all in their separate little zones.\u0027            The previously overgrown backyard with a pond full of frogs has been replaced with a Mediterranean-style garden          A quiet area in the upstairs of the house, where there used to be a drug den which the couple found strewn with used needles           \u0027There were lots of people living there before,\u0027 Dixon said.

The cracked ceiling is leaking, and the runway viewing windows are broken or missing.But British architects are leading international calls for it to be saved from the wrecking ball. These exclusive photographs show the iconic revolutionary building and capture the last pictures of its ghostly interior.Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union along with Georgia and Azerbaijan in 1922. Soviet Armenia\u0027s economy transformed in this period from a predominantly agricultural one into an industrial success.

Stubs of old tickets to Moscow and beyond lie strewn on the dusty floor.In the post-war period the country\u0027s economic development further expanded to include military engineering, radio-electronics and an car industry and the Soviet Union centred a considerable part of their military electronic production and scientific research projects in production there. However in 1988, a democratic movement was set up in Armenia which demanded the return of disputed Karabakh territory which had been given to Azerbaijan by Stalin.  The Karabakh movement\u0027s success eventually led to Armenia\u0027s break from the Soviet Union in August 1990, a year before the collapse of the USSR, Armenia declared its independence.

A road flyover and some metal bridges connecting arrivals and departures, have already been pulled down.

It\u0027s part of our heritage and history, but many don\u0027t realise what they\u0027re giving up. We\u0027re a land-locked country with poor roads. The old airport could be renovated to be the centre of a network of regional airports. We\u0027ve got the backing of international architects, including British.\u0027The airport was truly revolutionary – it was just 15 metres from your car to the plane. There was a special underground luggage delivery system, and a plane refuelling pipe that ran round the airport, emerging at the underbelly of each aircraft. Unheard of in 1976.

It was built in an era when Soviet architects were experimenting with international influences\u0027Also, in Soviet times everything was regulated – even the thickness of the paint on the wall. But my father got round all that by always leaving room in his designs for later expansion.\u0027Most of all, he designed for the people. Armenians are scattered all over the world, so for homecomings he made sure the arrivals balcony looked down on waiting families below. It was all very emotional.\u0027Clem Cecil, of SAVE Europe\u0027s Heritage and director of London\u0027s Pushkin House, the Russian cultural centre, said: \u0027The Zvartnots building is a classic of its kind – it should be saved. It was built in a period when Stalin\u0027s grip had been broken and Soviet architects were experimenting with international influences.She added: \u0027Zvartnots is very cutting edge and reflects the excitement of the times. The problem is it\u0027s been under-appreciated and vulnerable.

This was their farewell to football – and mine too’Football was everything to me in my teenage years. My father and grandfather played, so there was never any question that I would. But when I was offered football scholarships, I turned them down to study the arts. Coming back 20 years later to shoot the game I gave up for photography gave me a rush of nostalgia.This shot is of the Vikings, a high-school team in Phoenix, Arizona. I chose this school because it was like the one I attended, with the same vast array of social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. I spent the whole season with the Vikings, getting to know the boys and their families. I realised how much the game meant to them – and how much it still means to me.This was taken during the warm-up for the final home game of the season, known as seniors’ night. It was the last time they were putting on the pads and playing in front of fans, friends and families. It was pure pageantry: mothers brought flowers and walked the players on. Fathers embraced their sons when the pads came off. Playing football requires a military level of dedication, from parents as much as players, and this was a celebration of that.You can see the teams squaring up to each other. They got into formation, sang their school chants, tried to psych out their opponents. But it wasn’t just about intimidation. This also helped to solidify team identity, building the bonds that can mean the difference between victory and loss.For many of the young men, football offered a sense of identity and belonging they might not find in later life. In today’s political climate, watching kids unite across class and racial ides was especially powerful. But it was also deeply sad. In a school like this, maybe one or two would go on to play football at college, and probably none would play in the national league. This wasn’t just goodbye to high-school football, it was goodbye to the game itself.American football has become a source of controversy, some of it justifiable. Criticism of the kind of masculinity it encourages are legitimate. There’s a dark side to the game that encourages explosive aggression and lavishes praise on players, making them think they’re untouchable. But it’s also one of the few spaces where young men can express emotion. I saw these boys broken, weeping in their fathers’ arms, being vulnerable in public in a way society rarely allows.There has also been a focus on “locker room talk” since the tapes of President Trump leaked, which I think is deeply unfair to locker rooms. These young men were more culturally aware and had higher emotional IQs than my peers and I had at their age. Football might encourage machismo, but it also instils a sense of responsibility not to let team or school down.And the Colin Kaepernick debacle has politicised a game many of us thought was beyond politics. People have rallied behind the idea that taking a knee during the national anthem is somehow un-American. It’s completely ridiculous. As someone who loves the game and loves my country, it’s heartbreaking to see it become yet another source of ision.I think the game will weather those storms, but its future is still under threat. In the last few years, we’ve learned more about football’s impacts on players’ health. It isn’t just the sheer force of collisions. It’s the repetitive nature of the physical trauma. I’ve had shoulder surgery twice, hip surgery, my left knee is going to have to be replaced and my back is ruined. I’m 38, but my body and mind feel older than they should.The more stories I’ve read, the more times I have experienced the long-term effects of the game, the more I’ve realised football won’t be something I pass down to my children.

According to the chain, the minimum starting rate for bar staff over 18 is £8.05 an hour while kitchen staff receive £8.25 an hour – increasing by 10p in each case after a probation period.Chris Heppell, a 29-year-old working in one of the pub chain’s kitchens, said that every penny counted when he and his colleagues were struggling to get by. In his own case, more than half of what he earned each month went towards paying £450 in rent to share a cramped one-bedroom apartment.“It’s impossible to save and you find yourself taking on more and more hours just to keep on top of the debt,” said the politics graduate who has worked in the hospitality sector since graduating, spending the last four years on what he described as “poverty wages” at Wetherspoon’s.“Up until recently I haven’t thought very much about the future because it is genuinely scary, but that has started to change.”Heppell is among workers at the pub chain who have joined the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) after being inspired by the strike action taken last year by McDonald’s workers in a dispute over zero-hours contracts and conditions.Another Wetherspoon’s kitchen worker, 19-year-old student Alex McIntyre, described working for the company as the most “emotionally and physically draining” job he had undertaken after working extensively in the hospitality sector.McIntyre said over the course of a 30-hour week, he worked in a small kitchen that was often understaffed, and put more than half of his wages towards renting in shared accommodation with five others.“I have an overdraft and rarely have a full fridge. I just thought that was what student life was, but there’s a sense now that this could change. Being paid £10 an hour would mean that I literally don’t have to choose between a food shop or getting a long needed haircut – basic things that people take for granted,” he said.“Now though, I’m being asked about union membership by friends and people from my generation on social media who wouldn’t have considered it before. The cards we have been dealt mean that a lot of us have tended to keep our heads down until now.”Wetherspoon’s spokesman Eddie Gershon said that rates of pay have come under review at most pub and restaurant companies and the chain had announced on 14 September that it was increasing pay rates in the last financial year (to July 2018) by £20m and would be increasing rates this year by £27m.“We also decided several months ago that management will work a 40-hour week instead of the current 42.5 hours from April 2019. We are also moving to the same rate for 18-21s as we already have for over 21s from 5 November 2018,” he said.TGI Fridays, which was named and shamed earlier this year by the government for failing to pay workers the legal minimum wage, said at the time of a walk-out in August by staff in a dispute over tips and pay that it believed all of its workers were treated and paid fairly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c15a49aa120cc90401265509d527e01fa33cd7a/23_102_1231_739/master/1231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=371a180507b17db3badffdd966fe02e4","title":"everday memories of addis ababa a photo essay","story":"Beginning as a Tumblr page, website VintageAddis invites Ethiopians to share old photographs from family archives, and aims to document the lives of communities throughout the 20th century. The web project and Instagram feed started by Philipp Schütz, Wongel Abebe and Nafkot Gebeyehu, reveals an intimate view of the city.Terefe Berlie Asmare moved to Addis Ababa in 1980 and spent much of the next decade driving. He worked at a garage in the Ethiopian capital by day, and studied engineering by night. At weekends he would roam the countryside in his father’s car, with a tent bought from the German embassy in the boot, and a Konica in his pocket.“I always took the camera with me,” he says, standing in the garden of Addis Ababa’s iconic, though fading, Wabi Shebele hotel, which is still owned by the family of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia’s last emperor. Asmare, now in his 60s, documented his road trips extensively, being one of the few people he knew with a camera – he was the lucky owner of the world’s first commercial autofocus. “There were no photographers at that time,” he recalls. “So I did most of the pictures myself, often with a self timer.”In one carefree shot he leans cockily against his Mazda car in view of Lake Langano, a spot popular with Addis Ababa’s middle classes then and now. His white socks are pulled up high and a red baseball hangs nonchalantly from his fingers. It’s a world away from the land of famine and war that foreign photojournalists etched in the popular consciousness of the 1980s.Terefe’s photos – he believes has more than 1,000 from this period – might have disappeared were it not for Vintage Addis Ababa. A website that started in July 2017 as a Tumblr page, the project Vintage Addis Ababa invites Ethiopians to share old photos from family archives as a part of an effort to document the lives of various people throughout the country’s tumultuous 20th century of empire, war and revolution. Vintage Addis Ababa is the brainchild of Philipp Schütz, a Swiss publisher and photographer based in the city, of Wongel Abebe, an Ethiopian photographer, and of Nafkot Gebeyehu, a documentary photographer. The project peels away the popular cliches to reveal a more innocent city with an intimate and familiar past.Schütz says, referring to some of the 1,800 plus photographs they have amassed so far: “They look exactly like my parents’ family archive, of the photos of my grandparents in the 1950s.” He and Abebe were surprised by the enthusiasm with which the city’s residents accepted the idea. “It was totally unexpected,” he says. “We’re not digging out 100-year-old photos. These are just everyday, family, stories from a time which a lot of people still remember.”Abebe thinks the project taps into a latent frustration with the way the Ethiopia has been represented over the years. “People are sick and tired of the famine and all that,” she says. “This is about how people want to be remembered.” Many of the photos they have received were submitted by friends and relatives wishing to commemorate their departed, or ageing, loved ones.Photographs belonging to the late Kassa Gebru, an engineer-turned-businessman who built Addis Ababa hotel in the 1950s, were given to Abebe by his daughter, who felt he deserved recognition for founding the city’s first venue for live jazz.The project also appeals to the occasional nostalgia some Ethiopians feel for their past, even for a period like the 1980s, a decade stained by bloodshed and economic privation under the communist regime known as the Derg. “I was a bachelor,” says Asmare. “I spent most of my time travelling and I really enjoyed it. In Addis there was less traffic because nobody had cars – the Derg had banned imports – and on Saturday nights there would be parties in Ras hotel, in Ghion hotel, and of course here in Wabi Shebele. When I look at the photos in my albums it’s like a dream.”“Genet’s father was very strict, like most fathers at the time. She wasn’t allowed to go out of the house besides go to school she was expected to come straight home afterwards and would be in trouble if she didn’t arrive within 30 minutes after home-time.” Girls at the time were expected to be timid and walk with their heads tucked down. They weren’t allowed to leave their house for just recreation. “One time, a few girlfriends and I took a photo as we celebrated a friend’s graduation at Addis Ababa university, as she earned her business degree. I had to hide that picture for years so my father wouldn’t see it.”Vintage Addis Ababa is part of a broader trend towards revisiting and rethinking Africa’s recent history. Schütz was inspired by a project that digitises old Ugandan photographs, though his focus was narrower and with more emphasis on family and private lives. Calling to mind the work of the late Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and Burkina Faso’s Sory Sanlé, both of whom captured the colourful optimism of post-independence west Africa, these photos of mid-century Addis Ababa evoke a similar mood. They chart the evolution of fashion, hairstyles, and even the city’s physical environment, making Vintage Addis Ababa a rich exercise in cultural history. Some of the districts seen here have long since disappeared, or, like the old Italian quarter known as Piassa, are now on the brink of demolition.The project started out as a website aiming to reach as many Ethiopians as possible, but it is soon to be published as a book. The team also hope the idea will eventually spread to other Ethiopian cities. As it stands, Vintage Addis Ababa offers a glimpse into the past but only a fleeting one. “We don’t want to be misleading,” says Abebe, of the project’s title. “You can never represent the whole of Ethiopia in pictures.”“We learned everything, starting from shooting and marching, to office administration and finance,” she remembers. After an intensive training that took well over a year, the women were graduated by the emperor himself. The newly inaugurated women army never went to a battlefield. “We were always invited to shows and asked to make appearances at official events,” Tsehay chuckles, “We were treated more like celebrities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a819ed5d9b6e30ca73c462de9d6d1bd31d7cb343/0_314_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86b08c26933c47b91d60ea6a1f57d44f","title":"labour democracy grassroots selection mps","story":"Socialism is the democratisation of every level of society, or it is nothing. It is based on an understanding that the concentration of wealth and power leaves democracy hollowed out, and that simply trooping to a polling station every few years is an insufficient counterweight to the behemoths of global capital. Under the prevailing system, the same vested interests remain in power whoever is in office, which is why a transformative government must seek to democratise the workplace, the economy and all of society’s pivotal structures, from the media to local government. But if this is Labour’s mission, it must surely begin at home and here, the noises are distinctly mixed.Labour’s democracy review was launched with hopes of upending an era of top-down contempt for the membership. From the 1980s onwards, members were increasingly treated as out-of-touch leftwing eccentrics who had helped condemn Labour to electoral disaster. A cordon sanitaire was needed around both the activists and the trade unions who were treated “like embarrassing relatives that need to be locked in the attic”, as Ed Miliband memorably put it. Ironically, this mentality drove the Labour right to demand the abolition of the party’s electoral college for electing leaders – ided into three equal sections of members, MPs and trade unionists – and the introduction of its £3 registered supporters’ scheme. That would allow the centre-ground public to flood into the party, went the rationale, and dilute the union and activist left. Before Jeremy Corbyn entered the 2015 leadership race, Liz\u0026nbspKendall’s team were boasting the Blairite candidate could win a million votes (in the end, it was fewer than 19,000). One of the greatest own goals in modern British political history helped create one of the biggest political parties in the western world, but one committed to socialism rather than rehashed Blairite triangulation.Unions understandably fear that their power would be weakened. The Labour party was founded, after all, as the political wing of organised labour. The unions have long provided an organic relationship between the party and working-class communities, and – at times – were all that stopped Labour becoming a husk, rootless, overrun by careerist hacks and time-servers. But their levels of resources and staffing mean unions would still play a decisive role in internal contests.Genuine democracy is frequently messy, not stage-managed. But the decisions of Labour’s membership over the last three years have spared it the same fate as its European sister parties, who, in many cases, now face electoral oblivion. It doesn’t mean packing the parliamentary party with the uncritical and relentlessly\u0026nbspon-message: Labour needs MPs committed to socialism, who are prepared to criticise the party’s failure to commit to reversing all benefits cuts, or to push for more radical tax policies, or to speak out more passionately in defence of migrants. Those future leaders exist, but the membership must be given the power to discover and support them. Labour’s mission is to democratise Britain: but first, it must surely democratise itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c46b9e042d3309f5b70f08e3a0ed9fd479ba1e80/0_25_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f34887ef13f56d6809876c447b5f6ea4","title":"royal commission botched brexit theresa may red lines","story":"The image of a confident Theresa May arriving in Downing Street on 13\u0026nbspJuly 2016, having swept aside other Conservative hopefuls, now seems to belong to another age. “As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us,” May promised.Fine words, but the lost opportunity between that speech and her address to her party conference less than three months later is the root cause of so much of the troubles and isions that have beset the Brexit process ever since. There is time for the course of Brexit to be altered. It may be that – this week in Salzburg, perhaps later – the EU will make a genuine attempt to save May’s bacon. It may be that some of the ideas from Chequers will eventually be built into the political declaration forming the basis of the future trade deal, which will be negotiated only after we leave on 29 March 2019. Nonetheless, it is worth exploring what went wrong at the start of May’s premiership to ask how a country that prided itself on having a strong, functioning civil service, a history of pragmatism and huge experience in international relations can have mishandled the approach to Brexit so badly.What is so remarkable is that the government’s first attempt to put the UK’s position on the table in respect of the future deal did not emerge until that Chequers meeting in July 2018. Given that it was always known that there would be only two years in this process once article\u0026nbsp50 was triggered, the question remains: what, beyond an obsession with internal faction-fighting among Tory MPs, was going on during the previous two years?New prime ministers know that the space to set a bold course is never so great as in the immediate aftermath of victory. The window of opportunity was wide open for May that summer. The paramount need was to find a way to unite the nation after the referendum – to create a country that works for every one of us, as she said. Sheltering behind the temporarily useful banality of “Brexit means Brexit”, the government could have moved swiftly to gather all the talents to consider the options. A royal commission would probably have been ruled out as too slow and cumbersome, but some less formal vehicle could have been engineered for the purpose.The time – indeed more time, but for the unnecessary rush to trigger article 50 – could have been used to scout the territory ahead, all the while talking to the EU, making plans to avoid the obvious traps and to seek a path to a successful outcome. Instead, the prime minster allowed her small team of close advisers to dictate the way ahead. The result was heard at the Tory conference that October, in a speech that included red lines on migration (“ending free movement”), sovereignty (“taking back control of our laws”) and ending the jurisdiction of the court of justice. Those red lines, repeated in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017, have hamstrung the UK ever since, while failing to quell the storms within the Conservative ranks.Those speeches made clear to the EU, if not the UK as a whole, that our path was heading straight towards Canada. And “Canada dry” at that: a narrowly focused free trade agreement concentrating on movement of goods. Even where such an arrangement is not in the UK’s interest, as with the loss of access to the Schengen Information System – an intelligence database used 539m times last year by British authorities to look up suspects and vehicles – and the European arrest warrant, so recently used by the UK to put out an alert on the men wanted in connection with the Salisbury attacks.Is there anything to be salvaged as the deadline of 29 March 2019 approaches? First, May must come out of the bunker and talk to real people – business people, employers and their workers – in real places, not simply those staged for the benefit of TV. She must invite in advisers from outside who know how borders actually work, or what applying a visa regime means in practice. Look at the multitude of blogs with policy offerings. At least show some signs of listening to, and engaging with, the other side, rather than driving through a hard Brexit that can only ever suit barely half the country.Second, she should use the window between now and the end of March 2019 to set up that royal commission to work out what the UK wants from that future UKEU free trade deal. The Brexit select committee already provides one template – but its membership should be expanded to include more devolved representation and civil society.And most of all, it’s time to front up with the public over the real trade-offs now in play. The closer we get to Canada, the more sovereignty is returned, but the greater the economic hit. Spell out clearly that what’s sauce for the British goose is sauce, too, for the EU gander. Applying a visa regime to EU nationals means a visa regime will be also applied to British nationals. Failure, even at this late stage, to engage with all sides will create a generation of the disengaged and discontented. That would hardly be the unifying legacy that the prime minister promised two summers ago.• Catherine Barnard is a professor of EU Law at the University of Cambridge and a senior fellow for The UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5dbb617b08d5f54c4fefc439ad7f71757335599/0_127_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac0cb457c7bbc00355f185d78772fe3","title":"forgiveness forgotten virtue bitter times","story":"At a literary festival not so long ago, I interviewed the novelist Sophie Hannah – known particularly for her twisty psychological thrillers – and the subject of grudges came up. Hannah’s forthcoming book is a non-fiction study of the power of the grudge to transform our lives, if we work out how to deal with them sensibly and effectively. To be clear, I don’t believe she is advocating tracking down the schoolmate who stole your best marble when you were seven and exacting revenge more along the lines of working out what your grievance is telling you about yourself and how best to deal with it. I nearly forgot to ask another question because I found myself marooned in the memory of a decades-old dispute over a parking space.To this end, she had given each audience member a slip of paper, on which they could fill out their most deeply held grudge and return it to her. Bookish event-goers can be a little wary of audience participation, but her request prompted a flurry of activity: ruminative looks, darkened brows and feverish scribbling.All of which frenzied fulmination is fascinating in the light of the findings of psychologists at Yale, the University of Oxford and University College London, who reported that we’re actually rather better at thinking good of people than writing them off as rotten apples. Molly Crockett, one of the authors of the paper, explains that our brains form “social impressions in a way that can enable forgiveness”, and that this is useful because “people sometimes behave badly by accident” and that “we need to be able to update bad impressions that turn out to be mistaken. Otherwise, we might end relationships prematurely and miss out on the many benefits of social connection.”It’s quite true that the greatest friend is the one who will provide unasked-for reassurance the morning after the night before, as the novelist Beryl Bainbridge once described of her pal Bernice Rubens: “I got drunk at one of her dinner parties and she rang me the next day because she knew I’d be feeling remorse, to tell me I behaved beautifully, which wasn’t true.” The helpful ones who make contact to give you advice about drinking apple cider vinegar and respond to queries about indiscretions with a hesitant “We-ell” are asking to be given the bum’s rush, in my opinion.However, these are trifles compared with the more serious stuff of life as the scientists suggest, it’s one thing to weigh up the positive and negative aspects of a person’s behaviour, but quite another to bend so heavily towards forgiveness and second chances that another’s harmful actions are tolerated, and even normalised, to the detriment of those around them. The report acknowledges, for example, the danger that forgiving can present in the context of bad relationships and, while we know that women in abusive domestic situations frequently stay in them because of an entirely justified fear of violent reprisal should they leave, the emotional consequences of hoping for behavioural improvement that will likely never come can also be highly destructive.Forgiveness is both complex and personal: if we set the bar for casting miscreants into the outer darkness too low, we risk the isolation of perfectionism if we set it too high, we might well find ourselves seething with suppressed resentment. And there is also the issue of projection. None of us is without flaws, nor past incidents in which we know we have behaved less than well if we seek forgiveness for our own frailties, why should we not bestow it? How many times have you raged about the ignominies visited upon you, only to realise you might perhaps be better off looking in the mirror? As the late Josephine Hart, author of the novel Damage, once said to me: “It’s like Medea out there.”On a macro level, traumatised communities that have been through processes of truth and reconciliation generally find it easier to face the future than those that haven’t. But such processes also rely on a basic willingness to admit wrongdoing and culpability as we watch the horrendous unravellings prompted by the #MeToo and other social justice movements, it’s evident that the impunity that abusers have shown and continue to cling to inflicts serious consequential damage.But we can derive something of great potential value from the idea that we are, as human beings, capable of setting the past aside. The propensity of social media to encourage a discourse of denunciation, in which a person’s transgressions co-exist with their present lives, in which the line between “calling out” and futile, zero-sum bullying is ever blurrier, is not, ultimately, a pathway to happiness. There is much to be angry about, and there are many perpetrators of cruelty and malfeasance to confront. But in the week of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, it’s reassuring to see a study confirming the reparative power of admitting our imperfections, saying sorry and moving forward.• Alex Clark writes for the  and the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/663b3f65a90239905026594aa95a2b852d724561/0_0_3915_2360/master/3915.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6a1eae5625360dc50e49c68786f09534 1290w","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game. By Chas Newkey-Burden“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

Our odd but evenly-matched couple go on the road all over France in JR’s specially adapted van, which is like a mobile photo booth. They arrive in villages and towns and get locals to take their portrait pictures in the back of his vehicle, which he can then print out at gigantic size, sometimes doing a whole body shot printed out piecemeal, and which he then plasters on to the sides of buildings, matching the sections up with a wallpaperer’s innate skill, though we never see this tricky manoeuvre. The results are utterly spectacular, and often unbearably moving. Varda and JR put giant pictures of early-20th-century miners on the side of cottages once occupied by these workers, with the huge face of one woman who is the only person still living in the terrace. She is overwhelmed with emotion to see it. You can feel what she feels. This collaboration of Varda and JR is a bit like Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in Michael Winterbottom’s The Trip, or maybe like Aretha Franklin duetting with George Michael. And the pictures themselves: what are they? For all their stunning force, they could be criticised as a novelty, or even a kind of vanity, tacitly contrasting the subjects’ humility with the artist’s immense prestige. Does JR envisage them being up for ever, or is ephemerality a part of their charm? The duo put up a picture on an extraordinary concrete structure sticking up surreally in the midst of a vast beach: a wartime blockhouse that, in fact, fell from the edge of a cliff. The sea washed the image off within 24 hours, and I felt oddly glad, in a way, because the structure had its own beauty. But really the images are rather glorious. Eventually, a sour note is struck by the old curmudgeon, Godard, himself. He is pointedly not at home when Varda and JR call, breaking what appears to have been a date, I suspect because he did not care to play a supporting role in Varda’s movie and also because he fought shy of being called an “older” version of Varda’s current collaborator. She is angry and upset, and she isn’t acting. It is a beguiling and utterly unique piece of work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382362ffc8349783dc1c941317c0df8d603c5fa6/0_38_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=541c8abb2edeaefb3db0aeb75899b691","title":"cristiano ronaldo sent off valencia juventus ajax aek athens champions league roundup","story":"• Ronaldo may miss trip to Manchester United next month• Ajax defeat AEK Athens 3-0 Bayern Munich beat Benfica 2-0Cristiano Ronaldo may miss a return to Old Trafford with Juventus on 23 October after he left the pitch in tears following a red card for violent conduct against Valencia.

The referee, Felix Brych, showed Ronaldo a straight red card after discussing the incident with his assistant behind the goal.The Portugal captain looked baffled and kept protesting his innocence, briefly lying on the ground to express his disbelief.

He will be closer to furious now that his side have lost ground in the Champions League with their most inept performance of the season, the English champions being made to look amateurish at times by the side that finished third in Ligue 1 last season.Lyon were actually quite good, despite a poor run of domestic form, but with Guardiola taking a turn at being a spectator City were short of ideas and leadership on the pitch. The City manager had to take a back seat for this match, a Uefa suspension as a result of haranguing officials in the defeat by Liverpool last season. He has recently complained of being angry when he sees players repeatedly choosing the wrong options and this display will not have calmed him down, however far he was from the action.City’s problem in recent weeks has usually been in front of goal. A selfish decision here, a poorly hit pass there, all add up to a lack of ruthlessness in finishing that Guardiola felt would cost his side against experienced opponents in the later stages of the Champions League.Lyon are not exactly that, but any hopes City might have had of a gentle opening against a side struggling for results back home were dashed when the home side went behind after an uncharacteristically slapdash first half-hour.Watching from the stands, Guardiola must have felt like pulling the brim of his flat cap lower and lower as he surveyed one mistake after another. City were not just wasteful in the opposition penalty area, they were guilty of errors all over the pitch. David Silva giving the ball away on the edge of his own area then crashing into Fabian Delph in his efforts to retrieve it Kyle Walker passing the ball straight to Houssem Aouar, Aymeric Laporte being turned by Memphis Depay, these are all sights to which Manchester City coaches are no longer accustomed.To the joint disbelief of Guardiola in the stand and Mikel Arteta on the touchline 26 minutes of insipid football were capped by an absolute gift of a goal to offer the visitors some barely deserved encouragement. First, Fernandinho gave the ball away on halfway with City in attack mode, inviting Nabil Fekir to exploit the space that would normally have been filled by Walker. The Lyon captain duly skipped away to send over a cross from the left, yet it was poorly directed and gave Delph every chance to clear. One air shot later, the City left-back could only watch as Maxwel Cornet took control behind him and slipped a low shot into Ederson’s bottom-right corner.“You have zero margin in the Champions League,” Arteta said. “If you lose concentration, if you don’t win the duels, you pay the price.”Ilkay Gündogan had a goal disallowed for a tight offside against Raheem Sterling as City tried to claw their way back into the game and Gabriel Jesus protested vigorously that he should have had a penalty when he appeared to go over Rafael’s knee, but before Arteta had the chance to get angry himself at half-time his side slipped further behind.Fernandinho again lost the ball on halfway, this time less culpably after receiving the ball under pressure, and Fekir ran directly for goal and held off John Stones to score. No wonder Liverpool were so interested in the 25-year-old’s signature, the France striker can certainly make the most of limited opportunities.So can Sergio Agüero and City undoubtedly missed their injured line-leader, though Jesus is not a bad replacement. It was the lack of clear-cut opportunities that surprised in a lacklustre first half. To use a favourite Guardiola expression, City were simply not arriving in front of goal often enough.The second half began with chants of Agüero’s name from the crowd, though the Argentinian stayed on the bench and it was Fernandinho who saw the first shot roll wide.Jesus supplied a second, well saved by Anthony Lopes, before Leroy Sané was sent on to provide some much-needed pace and penetration. City remained stubbornly pedestrian though and should have gone a third goal down when Tanguy Ndombele expertly picked up Depay’s run through the middle after an hour. The ball was played into the former Manchester United player’s path and Depay did well to find the burst of speed to hold off Walker, only for his well-struck shot come back off an upright.That was enough to bring the introduction of Agüero, sore ankle or not, though it was Sané who began the fightback, darting to the byline on the left and cutting back for Bernardo Silva to reduce the deficit.Agüero’s first shot, on 72 minutes, was predictably on target, but Lopes got down well to save. When Walker put a free kick in a promising position high over the bar in the closing minutes it seemed to sum up City’s night.Agüero might have drawn City level at the death but for a fingertip save by Lopes, though that would have flattered a sloppy home performance. This was the most inauspicious of starts for the newly installed favourites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4479d36e1a58d45505de91f539a177ce556cf021/0_98_2233_1340/master/2233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8324d823bc79e6675aca62cc49bc88a","title":"mikel arteta guardiola ban manchester city defeat","story":"• Manager absent from touchline because of suspension• Coach says team were slow and careless against LyonMikel Arteta said he had no idea whether Pep Guardiola’s touchline absence because of suspension had anything to do with Manchester City unexpectedly losing a fourth Champions League game in a row, though the assistant coach did accept that the side had been slow and occasionally careless.“You can’t say what would have happened had Pep been around, it’s completely hypothetical,” Arteta said. “The only reality is that we lost the game. We started quite slowly, we lost too many duels and twice in the first half we gave away the ball in dangerous areas and allowed Lyon to score both times.”Arteta claimed his side’s reaction in the second half was superb, not an adjective that many Mancunians present would have selected, although he was probably correct in saying City created more chances after the interval than before it, even if that was not saying a lot.“At half-time we had to react, but that is normal, whether Pep is in the dressing room or not,” Arteta said. “That happens almost every half-time, it is not a new thing, we just had to try and improve what we were doing.”For a coach with managerial ambitions, this first-hand experience was a considerable disappointment. “I can’t really explain why we began so slowly, but sometimes in a new competition it takes a while to get on track,” he said. “We were finding it hard to come up with the right pass, we couldn’t build up any consistency and Lyon were able to take advantage.The Lyon coach, Bruno Génésio, smiled politely when asked whether beating the early favourites for the Champions League constituted the greatest result in the club’s history. “We have some history and I’m not sure I would call this the greatest feat,” he said. “But it is an achievement and we should be proud of it.“We decided to play as high as possibly to prevent Manchester City building from the back and it seemed to work. Across the 90 minutes it was a well-deserved result.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d07e623a4f3cf58042db5e57853ef36748b8304f/142_0_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6613edfd1c529721ab4b9a8f30224bed","title":"young boys manchester united champions league match report","story":"The mental edge José Mourinho praised in the build-up was evident in a Manchester United victory which must surely be the template for the season. Fast, cold-eyed and a concerted unit: these were the key components in their defeat of Young Boys on an artificial pitch flagged up as awkward but which proved a slick surface for United to show their class.Of the playing surface, Mourinho added: “I don’t understand how you can play the best European competition on artificial surfaces.”He had made five changes from the Watford game. There was a rare rest for Alexis Sánchez – he was a substitute – and a debut for Diogo Dalot, the young summer signing from Porto having recovered from a knee injury. Luke Shaw, Fred, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford were the other additions as United set out against an opposition recently crowned Swiss champions for a first time in 32 years. Gerardo Seoane sent his team out in the 4-4-2 that had won their opening six league games in a unbeaten start of 10 games.Mourinho talked Dalot up beforehand by pointing to how he played for Porto against Liverpool at Anfield last year, and the defender made an eye-catching start to his United career, being alert in defence and eager to rove forward. “I am happy,” Dalot said. “My team-mates helped me so much, I think I played good.”His manager said: “He is a 19-year-old player who has more than 10 years to play for Manchester United.”United headed into the interval with a priceless 2-0 lead as Shaw, Martial, Fred and Pogba all combined before some Fred Astaire-like footwork from the latter ended in David von Ballmoos being beaten by a slick left-foot finish.This left Mourinho motionless but he was a picture of delight when Pogba coolly doubled the lead from the spot. The referee awarded the penalty after he adjudged Shaw’s cross to have been handled by Kevin Mbabu.It looked harsh but United hardly cared. This had been their most clinical display this campaign and Mourinho’s half-time order to the players was, as he confirmed, to make sure they kept on keeping on.Martial soon suggested they would by spinning his man with ease and racing at a flat-footed defence that only just managed to recover. The attacker was again the player to trouble Young Boys when, this time moving along the right, he found Rashford but the No 10’s intended pass to Lukaku lost the ball.Moments before, Lukaku might have scored when slipped in by Rashford but he fluffed the chance, yet it was clear how dominant the visitors had become. At this juncture the only danger was complacency and there was a wake-up call when Roger Assalé was fed in the area and for a moment looked to have pulled a goal back.Yet the kind of evening this was for United was summed up by Martial –who has been at loggerheads with the manager – registering the third from a clever pass from the outstanding Pogba. This came on 66 minutes and a little later Mourinho decided Fred and Rashford could be protected as he replaced them with Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini.Martial’s goal was his first since 20 January at Burnley and given that Mourinho had lost his previous two matches in Switzerland, there was further succour to be had."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57cfc9b45b6cf3336fde23b4c3430282d8306c5d/0_134_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=356d65e4399b0cfb7d2770c55b9102b5","title":"john lewis customer service carpet","story":"The stairs in our new house were slippery so we ordered a carpet runner from John Lewis.

Now, it’s absolutely inevitable there will be a discussion on conference floor, I can’t conceive there won’t be – we’re 200 days away,” she said. “Without a doubt, there has to be a debate.”More than 100 constituency Labour parties have submitted motions to the Labour conference calling for the party to back a referendum on any final Brexit deal, which campaigners believe is an unprecedented number.The drive has been spearheaded by a number of leftwing groups, including Another Europe is Possible, Remain Labour, Labour for a People’s Vote and the student group For Future’s Sake (FFS).The final motion put to Labour conference is likely to be a compromise thrashed out between delegates from CLPs that have submitted anti-Brexit motions, trade unions and the leadership.Labour’s governing national executive committee could also offer its own statement as a substitute, rather than risk being defeated on the conference floor in Liverpool by grassroots delegates who support a second referendum.Momentum has not backed a new referendum and is cautious about doing so. Parker’s instincts are clearly pro-Europe, but she is wary of restricting the Labour leadership’s political flexibility. “We are waiting to see what motions come to conference floor,” she said.Campaigners backing a second referendum have prepared comprehensive briefing packs for delegates and drop-in sessions during conference.“The red line is we have to have the phrase ‘people’s vote’ somewhere in the composite,” one campaigner said.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, an FFS co-founder, said the groups would co-ordinate their efforts. “The one cast-iron agreement across all the groups is that a people’s vote is the way to solve the crisis,” she said.Parker said she expected a compromise would be reached. “I don’t see a situation where Momentum says, ‘no, take this off the table.’ But that’s not the same of saying, ‘vote on the deal tomorrow’,” she said.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, have already suggested the party will keep the option on the table.“My view, then, is that we should have a general election because, in a general election, people can not only debate the range of issues in full, they can also select the team that will then negotiate our future position,” McDonnell told a Mumsnet chat on Tuesday.“If we can’t get a general election, we are keeping the option of another vote – a people’s vote – on the table.”• A special report by Jessica Elgot on the grassroots movement within Labour for a second referendum will be published online tomorrow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dda3955a1c808b01a32300f262d19a22b67e297/818_392_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b215fe0a976a2c15b84150aaf1a94b96","title":"im hard left hard remain grassroots bid for labour brexit seachange","story":"Constituency groups could force Jeremy Corbyn to agree to a ‘people’s vote’ at the conferenceFew people in Labour have heard of Michael Chessum, the self-described “hard-left, hard-remain” campaigner, who concedes he is an unusual frontman for a campaign that could transform the Labour party’s Brexit policy.“Last year the faces were Chuka Umunna, Heidi Alexander, I can’t really believe that this year, it’s people like me, it’s weird,” he says in his shared south London office, surrounded by anti-Brexit paraphernalia and protest signs.Chessum’s group, Another Europe is Possible, is just one of a number of grassroots organisations that have forced the party to have a conversation about Brexit that it has long delayed.More than 150 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions for debate at the party’s conference, which begins in Liverpool on Sunday, with the vast majority calling for a vote on the final deal.It is the result of an intense and unprecedented ground campaign by a coalition of grassroots groups. One Labour official said the number of motions on Brexit was so vast that they could have difficulty devising other motions for debate on other topics.Last year in Brighton, delegates followed Momentum’s direction to save the leadership’s blushes and blocked any potential vote on Brexit. In Liverpool, delegates will arrive with an unprecedented mandate from members to put a second referendum on the table after a campaign led by the pro-Corbyn grassroots.“The numbers are completely crazy. I thought we’d get 50,” one pro-remain MP said.Many campaigners and MPs hope the efforts will resonate beyond the party conference in ways that could have a major and unforeseen effect on the parliamentary arithmetic.“It gives MPs some cover,” another MP said. “Some have resisted voting on anti-Brexit amendments because they will get grief locally for seeming to be disloyal. But if their CLP has put this motion forward, it gives them the freedom to vote with their conscience.”Chessum, a member of Momentum’s first steering committee, said he wanted to transform the pro-remain cause within the party into one that was explicitly leftwing, tribally Labour and pro-Corbyn.“I am a diehard remainer and a diehard member of the hard left,” he said. “There is no bespoke Labour Brexit on the table. There is no time, even with a general election.”Chessum argues he is giving the leadership space to change its position, rather than closing it into a corner. “The Labour right loves ‘Corbyn v the membership’. That’s not what this is.”The group is technically cross-party and has worked with other leftwingers and Greens. For the summer, it has been working in co-ordination and hosting phone banks for another explicitly Labour group run by Mike Buckley, a former aid worker and community organiser, who founded Labour for a People’s Vote this year.“There was nothing to rally behind,” he said. “The people talking publicly about having another referendum, however well intentioned they are, they are not going to gather the majority of Labour party members behind them because they are seen as being anti-Jeremy.”Both groups have regional organisers and have relied on sign-ups and their existing networks, in local parties and Momentum groups, some relics of the 2016 referendum campaign.For all the groups involved, there is no roadmap. The summer’s efforts have involved a painstaking task of identifying pro-European members in more than 600 local parties, through a mix of local contacts, friends of friends, and online signups, and getting them to champion a motion through their CLP.Buckley said that organising local parties has been “surprisingly difficult” and relied on local knowledge. Both groups have links with the main cross-party campaign People’s Vote, but maintain a public separation. Another mainstream group, Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit campaign that has the financial backing of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has given £70,000 to Another Europe is Possible.Pro-European MPs have aided the groups in the background, helping them make connections, but have deliberately not led the campaigning.Though the groups are mainly run by young activists, it is older Labour members who have been the focus of some of the summer campaigning, because they make up the bulk of new members active in CLPs.The group that has most successfully used this tactic is the energetic pro-remain youth group For Future’s Sake (FFS) – a cross-party campaign which has close links to the official People’s Vote movement.Its young organisers have made provocative videos, deliberately designed to appeal to older members, placing the arguments about Brexit in the context of progressive political movements in British history, including the campaign for women’s suffrage and fighting the poll tax.FFS’s Liron Velleman has been co-ordinating its campaign on the ground to get CLPs to submit motions. “We get young people to sign up and then encourage older people from the CLP to get involved in the fight,” he said. “We tell them, our generation needs yours.”Previously unreleased data showed the average age of Labour party members and supporters who joined after 2015 is 51, and the most common age of this cohort to be 66. The project’s summer 2017 survey of Labour members revealed an average age of 53, with the most common age being 70.Now the local party organisation is over, campaigners from the main groups are turning their attention to the party conference itself. The first hurdle is ensuring Brexit is a topic on the agenda at conference, as one of eight topics chosen by members.Last year, Momentum steered its delegates to vote for other topics, including housing, NHS and the railways. That will not be repeated, its national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, said. “Last year, the context was very different. Now, it’s absolutely inevitable there will be a discussion on conference floor, I can’t conceive there won’t be – we’re 200 days away,” she said. “Without a doubt, there has to be a debate.”Momentum has not backed a new referendum and there is clearly some caution about doing so. Parker’s instincts are pro-Europe, but she is wary of restricting the Labour leadership’s political flexibility.“We are waiting to see what motions come to conference floor,” she said.Once Brexit is confirmed as a topic for debate in the ballot, delegates from those CLPs will meet trade union representatives and Labour’s Brexit secretary Keir Starmer on Sunday night to thrash out a compromise motion that could go to a vote.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, an FFS co-founder, said the groups would be co-ordinating. “The one cast-iron agreement across all the groups is that a people’s vote is the way to solve the crisis,” she said.Some senior Labour sources cautioned that it was now uncertain if delegates would be responsive to either Momentum or any of the other campaign groups.“Delegates are totally unbiddable now,” one said. “Last year, there was some degree of predictability that most delegates would at least do what Momentum instructed, but that is no longer the case.”Key to the success of any motion or compromise is the support of trade unions. Campaigners have been closely watching both the Unite conference and the subsequent Trades Unions Congress, where union leaders accepted or put forward motions that could be a blueprint for the Labour outcome.One of the “big three” unions, GMB, has already officially backed a new referendum, after polling its members. Smaller unions have also been key players, most notably TSSA and its general secretary, Manuel Cortes, and Community, a centrist union with many Brexit-voting members whose industrial membership recently backed a vote on the deal.Unite, Labour’s most generous donor and the UK’s second largest union, left the door open to backing a second referendum at its conference, with a leadership statement saying it was “open to the possibility of a popular vote being held on any deal, depending on political circumstances”.That statement is now the most likely model for a Labour compromise. “The key voice in the room will be Unite,” one senior union source said.The third major union, Unison, the largest in the UK, has remained studiously neutral. “They will be in the room at conference, they might act as honest brokers, but they don’t want to be forced to take a position,” the source said.The final outcome may ultimately be a fudge, the party’s governing national executive committee could offer a policy statement, keeping a referendum on the table without endorsing it. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have trialled that line in recent months.However, even if the NEC offers a statement, delegates could still push for an additional vote and a more radical motion.In the end, there is little will at the top of the party to prevent a Brexit debate taking place. “We would look ridiculous,” one source close to the shadow cabinet said. “The headlines last year were bad, but this would look terrible to outsiders watching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02336220a4423de8a190875a636fab3c81a38aa/0_27_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9702910541295fa1ee845b3ec0a02311","title":"tartuffe rsc buoyant satire of modern religious hypocrisy","story":"The Swan, Stratford-on-AvonThis striking new take on Molière by the writers behind Citizen Khan sends up religious phoniness and secular pretensionThese days, every classic play seems to be updated or “reimagined”. In the case of this new version of Molière’s Tartuffe by Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto, who collaborated on TV’s Citizen Khan and The Kumars at No 42, it makes total sense. What we see is a satire on modern religious hypocrisy that respects Molière’s flawless comic structure.The action has been relocated to a Birmingham suburb where a British Pakistani family live a life of comfortable affluence. Imran, the parvenu patriarch, was once proud of his Norwegian spruce decking, but has fallen under the spell of a seemingly straitlaced holy man, Tartuffe. Not only does Imran decide the family has to live as “real Muslims”, he also plans to marry his progressive daughter, studying the plight of women in sub-Saharan Africa, to Tartuffe and even signs over his property to the two-faced intruder.This is not the first time the play has been given an Asian context. In 1990, Jatinder Verma did a production set in Mogul India with Tartuffe as a saffron-skirted fakir for the National Theatre. The virtue of this new version by Gupta and Pinto is that it attacks both religious exploitation and secularised sophistication without condescension. In fact, it goes out of its way to make clear that Tartuffe is an aberrant con man rather than a genuine product of Islam. In one of the most potent lines of the production, Imran’s closest friend asks Tartuffe “how the most tolerant and academically inquisitive religion in the world ended up being hijacked by people like you?”Gupta and Pinto’s shrewdest stroke is to elevate the cleaner, Darina, into a pivotal figure. Hilariously played by a busily hoovering Michelle Bonnard, she here is a Bosnian Muslim who sees through Tartuffe’s fakery and the family’s social pretensions. She caps Tartuffe’s quotations from the Qur’an about female modesty by arguing that there is nothing to prove women should cover their hair or head. At the same time, she sees through the absurdity of Imran’s bromance with Tartuffe by comparing them to George Clooney and Brad Pitt – if the last two were Pakistani Muslims.Molière’s ironically happy ending has been ingeniously rewritten and even evokes a sliver of sympathy for Tartuffe. But Iqbal Khan’s buoyant production, like the text, gives full value to the set pieces, including the famous scene of Tartuffe’s attempted seduction of Imran’s wife. Asif Khan endows Tartuffe with just the right blend of outward sobriety and furtive lechery as he hops around in his leopard skin underpants. Simon Nagra as Imran exudes the guilt-ridden gullibility of a Birmingham businessman anxious to return to his Muslim roots, while Sasha Behar as his wife suggests a strong woman perfectly capable of outwitting Tartuffe on her own terms.One or two minor characters are strenuously overplayed and, though Sarah Sayeed’s music is good, it works overtime to remind us of the eclectic tastes of Imran’s family.The joy of the show is that it offers a vigorous new take on Molière’s play by reminding us that wealth offers no protection against a hostile environment and that all of the world’s religions are subject to slippery abuse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aeb7ebd336600913d86e840f0fd486b243cd316/0_526_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4111646750bafa68d38d0d6fc597bdd4","title":"north yorkshire lyke wake walk york moors","story":"Why would anyone want to hike 40 miles in less than a day? Because this ‘death march’ is the Yorkshire equivalent of climbing EverestAfter 28 hard miles, after cuckoos and curlews and dust and pain and sweat, Gerry Orchard crosses Wheeldale Beck over the stepping stones and sinks to one knee. This is no exhausted collapse it is the prelude to a song.“This yah neet, this yah neet,” he sings in a strong Yorkshire voice, “Ivvery neet an’ all. Fire an’ fleet an’ cannle leet, an’ Christ tak up thy saul …”The Lyke Wake Dirge, which dates back to the 16th century or earlier, was sung over the dead as part of local funeral custom. Since 1955 it has had a curious (after)life of its own, giving a name and a certain gravity to the Lyke Wake Walk, a challenge requiring walkers to cover 40 miles over the North York Moors, between the villages of Osmotherley and Ravenscar, within 24 hours. Singing is optional, though traditionalists with breath to spare may find the dirge soothing, a balm to sore feet and calloused souls.This, if I manage it, will be my first Lyke Wake Walk it will be Gerry Orchard’s 220th. He has made more successful crossings than anyone. When Bill Cowley, the North Yorkshire farmer who invented the Lyke Wake Walk, insisted that a “solemn silence should always prevail” upon it, he did not reckon with this man – 62 and whippet-thin – who is as fond of talking as he is of walking, and keen, whenever possible, to combine the two.“There’s a lot of stories that coffins were carried across the moors in days of old,” he says, “but sadly they’re not true. The real connection with the dirge is that toward the end of the Lyke Wake you feel like death. You look at those tumuli, the ancient burial mounds on the moors, and you think, ‘The guy in there is lucky. He has found peace, whereas I am still suffering.’”He chuckles. “One day, hopefully, when my time has come, they will bury me under there, and my ghost can heckle walkers as they go by.”We set off from Osmotherley at a little after 5am, choosing to walk west to east, towards the sea. High spirits, low cloud. It is cold and a little damp.“That’ll keep the snakes off,” says Gerry: adders are common on the moors. Six geese pass close enough for us to hear the shush of their wings. Bracken pushes, crosier-like, through the hillside. For its first nine miles, the walk passes through a landscape that is semi-agricultural and not unlike parts of the Highlands. One of the challenges and risks of the Lyke Wake is that it is not well waymarked but, here and there, on signposts for the Cleveland Way, some guerrilla hiker has screwed small wooden coffin shapes, painted black.In preparing for the walk, I had spoken with two men who were among the group of 13 who pioneered the first successful crossing, which took place on 1-2 October 1955. Bill Dell, now 78, was a boy scout from Middlesbrough. Malcolm Walker, 81, was a member of York Mountaineering Club (YMC). Both learned about the walk from the Dalesman magazine, where Bill Cowley issued a challenge to anyone who believed they could cover the distance in one day. It was much harder back then, Dell recalled: “There weren’t many paths. You were pushing through heather. We had a break at midnight in a couple of tents up on Blakey Ridge.”With the hotheadedness of youth, Walker and two others from the YMC decided to set off from this camp before the rest of the party were awake and crossed the finish line, as he recalled with some regret, three hours before everyone else.“I was in an awful state when I finished but the exhilaration was tremendous. It stretches the body of the average person to its absolute limit. For those of us who couldn’t aspire to climbing Everest, it was the greatest physical challenge we could hope to do.”The Lyke Wake is an odd mix of the attritional and the intense. You grind out the distance, always mindful you are walking against the clock.“It’s a war, not a battle,” says Orchard.It’s also psychological. If the idea of walking 40 miles is overwhelming, try to think of it as several shorter walks. Our plan is to stop, briefly, every time the route crosses a road. Gerry’s partner Julie meets us to replenish water bottles and hand out snacks from the boot of her car.This saves us carrying too much weight but even a supported walk can be tough. Three-quarters of the way across, I develop large blisters on the sides of each foot and will have to endure the last 10 miles in pain. The famous question posed in Corinthians, “O death, where is thy sting?”, finds a ready answer on the Lyke Wake Walk.But blisters are nothing. Gerry has seen walkers forced to give up with broken toes, broken wrists and, most commonly, utter exhaustion.“It can get highly emotional,” he says. “Grown men have been in tears.” The Lyke Wake can be bleak, the hours slow time snags and drags in the heather. There is a strong sense of the centuries collapsing into one another. A bronze age barrow, a medieval cross, the sinister pyramid of the RAF Fylingdales early-warning system … All are monuments raised by man, centuries apart – pagan, Christian, secular – yet each with the same twin purpose: hearkening to the universe while leaving some mark upon the Earth.Gerry will leave his mark, too – if only in the record books. Of the four “centenarians” – those who have completed 100 or more crossings – only two are still alive: Louis Kulcsar, now 80, who arrived in Britain from Hungary in 1956 as a refugee, is the other. Kulcsar, a retired baker, has completed the Lyke Wake 186 times, and has the distinction of having walked it without shoes and socks, an unimaginable feat on unimaginable feet he has also run it backwards. Gerry has walked the Lyke Wake so many times he could have walked from here to Papua New Guinea instead.At 8.36pm, in drifting fog, on limping legs, we reach the end: a stone marker just outside Ravenscar. “Stop the clock,” says Gerry, “we’re here.” It has taken 15 hours and 36 minutes. He hands me a patch in the shape of a coffin, and an official New Lyke Wake Club card. “Condolences,” it says, “on your crossing.” Now, if I wish, I can call myself a Dirger.Personal triumph, however, does not feel like an appropriate emotion at the end of the Lyke Wake. This isn’t a landscape to conquer. It is a memento mori on which one may, briefly, feel never more alive. I’m pleased and relieved to have finished the route but know, even in this moment of excitement, that my footprints have already disappeared into the moors with all the rest.• More information at lykewake.orgLooking for a holiday with a difference?

And here comes the theme tune, which you can never remember, but is as familiar as rain when it drops. And Kevin McCloud standing as was ever thus in front of a\u0026nbsptiny neoclassical folly, the kind where first snogs in period dramas always happen. “Visit any stately home in Britain\u0026nbsp…” he begins grandly, before describing follies as lying “templed in the landscape”. Ah, only McCloud would use temple as a\u0026nbspverb. Which, apart from anything else, makes it sound like a\u0026nbsppimple.This series opens with Jaime and Mimi Fernández who in 2017, in the midst of Brexit turmoil, inexplicably moved from Jaime’s native Madrid (“Best city in the world,” sighs Jaime) to a\u0026nbsprented bungalow in Buckinghamshire, to restore a 250-year-old folly. Which, like most Grand Design builds to be fair, is sheer\u0026nbspfolly.“I\u0026nbspmean, look at it,” McCloud enthuses grumpily, which sounds oxymoronic, but is actually his modus operandi. “Who would want to do that?” And so the foundations are laid for a\u0026nbspclassic episode, involving some minor peril, passive-aggressive building contractors, escalating costs, birth, death (via the discovery of human bones) and some ingenious stonework. It’s not up there with the one about the derelict water tower, but I’ll probably watch it three times over the next\u0026nbspdecade.The folly is a\u0026nbspminiature Tudor castle, originally built to house a\u0026nbspfossil collection. It cost Jaime and Mimi £100,000 without planning permission. This makes McCloud wince and groan, but if he didn’t wince and groan (enthusiastically, of course), it wouldn’t be Grand Designs. Or a\u0026nbspfolly. A\u0026nbspfire in the late 1800s burned out the wooden interior, and a\u0026nbspbeam of red brick installed by the council is all that is holding it up. Jaime, an architect and self-described “fighter”, is the kind of unflappable optimist who looks at this fresh hell and insists they will be able to move in after six months. Estimated cost: £200,000. Meanwhile, Mimi is tasked with looking after their two-year-old son and giving birth in four months. I\u0026nbspthink I\u0026nbspknow which is the more daunting\u0026nbsptask.Trenches are dug for power, water and sewage. An old Saxon burial ground is unearthed, which sounds thrilling, but means paying an archaeologist to examine every single bucket of earth. Jaime regrets nothing. Mimi regrets everything. McCloud buggers off to Dinton Hall, the estate to which the folly originally belonged, and which the present owner restored 20 years ago – at a\u0026nbspcost of £10m. To which mine is the timeless Grand Designs response: “WHO ARE THESE\u0026nbspPEOPLE?”Eventually, thanks to some cunning 3D-scanning technology, some micromanaging (“Jaime loves touching every piece of stone,” his builder moans) and the help of one of the UK’s only stone-cutting robots, the folly becomes a\u0026nbsphome. Of course, Mimi and Jaime nearly lose it along the way. “Are you going to be able to forgive the building?” McCloud asks. “There are moments when I\u0026nbspreally hate it, actually,” Mimi says. Jaime confesses he went to McDonald’s “and couldn’t pay” but feels “proud\u0026nbsp– it looks great”. And it does all rustic charm and staircases. The folly is a\u0026nbspfolly no more. It is a\u0026nbsphome to people, not fossils. On Grand Designs at least, things work out exactly as\u0026nbspexpected.And another thing\u0026nbsp… what’s with the autumn glut of great TV?

In the essay, he described himself as a victim of “mass shaming” and said he had endured “enough humiliation for a lifetime”.He wrote: “Even as I feel deep remorse about how I treated some people in my life, I cannot confess to the accusations that are inaccurate. What I do confess is that I was emotionally thoughtless.”The publication of the essay, which was hotly debated within the NYRB’s small team of editors, provoked a storm of debate about the extent to which men who had been the subject of #MeToo accusations of inappropriate or abusive sexual conduct should be allowed to rehabilitate themselves into society. It also raised eyebrows about Buruma’s editorial judgment.Buruma added fuel to the fire when last week he gave an interview to Isaac Chotiner of Slate in which he clumsily sought to justify the decision to publish. Though he praised the #MeToo movement, that has put the spotlight on the sexual misconduct of powerful men, as “a necessary corrective on male behavior”, he said: “Like all well-intentioned and good things, there can be undesirable consequences.”He went on to lament a “general climate of denunciation” and said that in the case of Ghomeshi there had been “undesirable, or at least unresolved, aspects to it”.Asked to comment on the numerous allegations of sexual assault by Ghomeshi – including punching women on the head – Buruma replied: “The exact nature of his behavior – how much consent was involved – I have no idea, nor is it really my concern.”Buruma, 66, has written often for the . He is author of several books including Murder in Amsterdam: the Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance and is professor of democracy and human rights at Bard College in New York state.A statement from the NYRB, which is published by Rea Hederman, who bought it in 1984, was expected later on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7612e636dd90e7059ebfb76b4d45766b7b96ff5e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb15334049b788d62cf123633f1da6db","title":"boorish tourists in venice targeted in mooted sitting down ban","story":"Residents’ groups are kicking back against the latest in a long list of banned activitiesAuthorities in Venice have proposed banning people from sitting and lying on the ground as the city pursues its quest to clamp down on what some officials describe as “boorish” tourists.The potential rule was suggested by the mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, and would mean transgressors being fined between €50 and €500 if implemented.Sitting down on the steps of monuments or those of the portico that surround St Mark’s square is already banned.The proposal is expected to reach a vote in the city’s council in October, although it faces opposition from councillors from the Five Star Movement as well as residents’ activist groups.“There is such a long list of things that are forbidden in Venice there is nothing left that you can do,” said Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the residents’ group Gruppo Aprile 25. “They would need to hire an extra 5,000 officers to properly enforce everything.”Authorities are also considering banning music on boats, the principal mode of transport for residents. People can already be barred from the city or fined for drunken behaviour and swimming or dipping their toes in the canals. Snacking on steps or while walking along the street are also frowned upon.Each summer, a group of so-called “angels of decorum” patrol the main tourist areas to ensure people are respecting the rules. Designated picnic areas, away from the hotspots, have been assigned for the purpose of sitting down and eating, although few people are aware of this.Venice has long struggled to manage a tourism industry that brings in about 60,000 visitors a day, many arriving by cruise ship.

Experts warn more numerous and even more ferocious hurricanes are on the way, and the US government is not addressing the central issue even as America’s coasts get battered and inland areas inundated.But based on the evidence in North Carolina on Wednesday, the random man and woman in the street is still not convinced about the science – even those who have faced two major storms in two years.“We live on the coast. It’s cyclical,” said Bob Slattey.“We may get two or three in a year, then go four or five years with nothing,” he added.Slattery, 74, and his wife Gerda Slattery, 73, were sitting in the pretty downtown area of Fayetteville on Wednesday. The couple live six miles south-west of Fayetteville and weren’t hit too badly by the storm, but much of the city was, as the Cape Fear river reached record flood levels, splurging over its banks into neighborhoods and roads.While miles of North Carolina is inundated, downtown Fayettevillehad been fortunate enough to avoid flooding this week, although locals said a wine bar roof had partly caved in.“There’s a group of people that want to control things, and they’re using climate change to control things, and they want to put a tax on things,” Bob Slattery said.There is scant evidence for a shady group using the concept of climate change to control and tax society – but it appears there is wider support for the theory in these parts.“That’s our opinion,” Gerda Slattery said.“And many other people I speak to think that, too,” Bob Slattery said.Florence hit North Carolina just two years after Hurricane Matthew blew through the state. Matthew set a slew of unwanted flooding records in October 2016 and at the time was described as a “once in a 500 year event”. But just 23 months later Florence has shattered that prediction, surpassing Matthew’s flooding totals and in many places having a worse impact.Despite the proximity of the storms, and expert views, some believe the science is overblown and it’s no more than natural global rhythms.“It comes down to cyclical climate change,” said Matthew Coe.“I don’t think we play as big a factor in climate change as people say we do – when you think of the fact that the sea level rises naturally anyways.”Coe 37, originally from Florida, is studying for an associates degree, alongside working at a downtown Fayetteville cafe. He lost power for three days after Florence roared in.“Mother Nature is its own entity,” he said. “Whatever happens it’ll fix itself eventually.” He pointed out that there had been fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature before, and predicted there could be another “ice age” which would correct the current trajectory of the climate.“I think everything is hyped up a bit,” he said. In his opinion, there are “scientists on both sides” of the climate change argument.Further along Hay Street, the thoroughfare through downtown Fayetteville, retired air force member Andre Altman was sitting in the Huske Hardware House bar.“Ask Mother Nature,” said Altman, 57. He echoed Coe’s belief that Earth’s capricious matriarch could be responsible for climate change and the ensuing increase in the number and force of storms.“Really the Earth goes through cycles. So it’s just we’re on that particular cycle where we’re grabbing more storms,” Altman said.“Back in the industrial age we were burning coal and it didn’t get hotter then.”Despite his belief that climate change was mostly a natural phenomenon, Altman accepted some of the science that said man was also to blame. He recycles, he said, but believes his own actions are likely to have little impact.“I try to worry about what I can affect. If I could actually do something about it, I would,” Altman said.“But I’m not in politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0853d52a28f8ee8512adfad9793028ec5b48e09e/0_311_3954_2372/master/3954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84f6f947d9e5e021f5fc38479bf03451","title":"us north korea nuclear talks restart reciprocal action","story":"Trump hails ‘tremendous progress’ as analysts warn the two leaders have different ideas of what denuclearization entailsThe US has said it is ready to “immediately” restart stalled negotiations with North Korea about nuclear disarmament in light of agreements reached at a summit of the two Koreas in Pyongyang.At that meeting, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, promised to dismantle a missile engine test site and launch pad, and made a conditional offer to shut down his country’s main nuclear complex at Yongbyon.The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Wednesday he had invited his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho, to meet in New York next week where both diplomats will be attending the UN general assembly. Other North Korean officials have been asked to meet US special envoy, Stephen Biegun, in Vienna.Donald Trump also welcomed this week’s Pyongyang meeting between Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.“We’re making tremendous progress with respect to North Korea,” Trump told reporters, adding: “We have a lot of very good things going.”In a written statement, Pompeo said: “This will mark the beginning of negotiations to transform US-DPRK relations through the process of rapid denuclearization of North Korea, to be completed by January 2021, as committed by Chairman Kim, and to construct a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula.”A day after their joint address, Moon and Kim headed out for a visit to the symbolic home of the Korean people, Mt Paektu, which sits on North Korea’s border with China. Travelling to Mt Paektu has been a long-held dream for Moon, who is an avid hiker and has previously trekked in the Himalayas.The mountain is a key piece in North Korean propaganda, and the official biographies of country’s founder and its second leader, Kim’s grandfather and father, say they were both born in the shadow of the mountain, bolstering their claim to the leadership. The mountain is also mentioned in South Korea’s national anthem and it features prominently in traditional Korean art.Since Trump declared North Korea “no longer a nuclear threat” following his own summit with Kim in Singapore in June, progress in disarmament negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang has stalled, as it has become clear the two leaders had very different conceptions of what the process would entail.Observers noted on Wednesday that Pompeo was similarly exaggerating what Kim had agreed on Tuesday in Pyongyang.In a joint declaration, it was agreed that the two sides would “cooperate closely in the process of pursuing complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”.For Pyongyang, the phrase signifies a phased process of mutual confidence building and arms control that would involve significant US concessions, not unilateral disarmament by Pyongyang. There was no mention of a deadline, as Pompeo had claimed.At his summit this week with Moon, Kim agreed to complete the dismantlement of a missile engine test and launch site in the north-west of the country, something he had previously offered to do in Singapore.The secretary of state also noted that Kim had undertaken to dismantle facilities at Yongbyon “in the presence of US and IAEA inspectors”.That would be a more dramatic step, although one that Pyongyang has partly carried out before, blowing up a reactor cooling tower 10 years ago. However, in the joint declaration in Pyongyang, Kim does not mention inspectors and makes the offer to dismantle Yongbyon contingent on the US taking “corresponding measures”.In Pyongyang, Kim did not make clear what those measures should be, but points towards an earlier joint declaration by Kim and Moon, which talks about a formal declaration of an end to the Korean war and eventually a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice.“The North Koreans want reciprocal action. What is that reciprocal action? They don’t specify so we don’t know,” said Sue Mi Terry, a former senior CIA Korea analyst now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “It is more than a peace declaration – a peace treaty, we have a problem.”“I don’t think this really moves the ball forward,” Terry said. “The different definitions of denuclearization are still there.”When asked about what concessions the US might make to North Korea, Trump replied: “Well, we’ll see what he’s looking at. We’ll see. But in the meantime, we’re talking. It’s very calm. He’s calm I’m calm. So we’ll see what happens.”Jung Pak, another former US intelligence official noted the Pyongyang declaration had come on the anniversary of a 2005 multilateral agreement in which North Korea had “committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs”.“We should recognise that 13 years ago, they agreed to far bigger concessions then,” Pak, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. “Kim is trying to turn back the clock and set the terms of what he is willing to talk about. These are minuscule moves on Kim’s part and we should treat them accordingly.”In contrast to the vague undertaking on denuclearization, the military annex to the Pyongyang declarations included very detailed steps both North and South Korea are to take to reduce the chance of any unintended border incident escalating into war.Areas around the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas are to be declared no-fly zones, the defence forces of both sides are to follow multi-step protocols to defuse border incidents, and guard posts along the DMZ are to be withdrawn.“Lessening the danger of a conventional military confrontation, which could escalate to the use of nuclear weapons is essential,” said Joel Wit, a former state department official and senior fellow at the Stimson Centre think tank. “The agreement reached at the Moon-Kim summit, which begins to move away from 60 years of confrontation since the Korean War, is a first step in that direction.”Kim and Moon also agreed on measures to revive economic cooperation, that could run afoul of Washington’s efforts to maintain sanctions on North Korea.“The 600lb gorilla in the room is sanctions,” Victor Cha, a former director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. “South Korea is promising all of these goodies to the North but can’t do any of it with sanctions in place – the subtext is clear, Seoul is going to approach the US to lift sanctions so it can pursue the inter-Korean peace, but the sanctions are on the regime for denuclearization and human rights abuses. Crossed lines that look like we are headed for a train wreck.”Cha said the progress in Pyongyang towards denuclearization was minimal.Joseph Yun, a former US special envoy on North Korea, said that while vague and conditional, Kim’s offer to dismantle Yongbyon, at least offered a route out of the current impasse in nuclear negotiations.“It opens the door a little bit,” Yun, now a senior adviser at the US Institute of Peace, said. “It could be the beginning of a process.“I would very much hope that Washington would respond constructively to this opening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b9836a84116c48abee03d8745412d81fe7a197d/0_183_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45c9c5714c8a52d517cf84ae49df7ed6","title":"brussels urged to investigate czech pm over business empire","story":"Andrej Babiš’s Agrofert given €75m of EU subsidies in 2017, prompting conflict claimsBrussels is being urged to investigate the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, over an alleged conflict of interest after transparency campaigners claimed new evidence of rule-breaking.Babiš, a billionaire businessman, who founded the Action for Dissatisfied Citizens party, became prime minister of the Czech Republic last December, but was soon embroiled in a scandal centred on alleged €2m EU subsidy fraud.The latest allegations, from Transparency International, go further by putting the spotlight on his entire Agrofert business empire, a conglomerate of 230 companies ning food, chemicals and media. Agrofert has rejected the claims as false.When he was finance minister in 2017, Babiš put Agrofert into a trust, to comply with new Czech legislation against conflicts of interest. But campaigners at Transparency International say he remains the “beneficial owner” of Agrofert in breach of domestic and EU law. They say the claim is based on research of company documents in Slovakia, as the Czech equivalents are not available to the public.“On one hand he is sitting in EU meetings, where he decides about the subsidies in his pocket,” said David Ondráčka, director of Transparency International in the Czech Republic. “And at the same time he uses these subsidies to fund his political career, where he is dominating over his opponents.”The Czech Republic is one of the biggest per-capita recipients of EU funds, along with Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. Agrofert received 1.9bn Czech crowns (£68m) of EU subsidies in 2017, three times more than in 2012, according to Transparency International.The allegations come amid tensions between Europe’s traditional parties and anti-establishment rivals that are often critical of the EU, but want to keep European funds flowing. Questions have been growing over cronyism in Hungary, as it emerged Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán’s friends and family had been awarded public tenders worth millions.Agrofert rejected in a three-page statement what it called the “false claims” made by Transparency International, which it argued were based on a misinterpretation of the term “final beneficiary” in Slovak law.“Andrej Babiš has no rights that would allow him … any decisive influence on the administration of the trusts,” it said. “Mr Babiš is not in breach of the Act on conflict of interest.”In an emailed statement to the  on Wednesday, Babiš said: “Transparency International spreads nonsense and keeps coming with such statements when there is a European summit or other events just like today when I travel to Salzburg.”He said he had put the company in a private trust fund and given up his business before entering politics in 2014.He also accused Transparency International of running a politically motivated campaign against him and being “easily influenced” because it received funding from the EU and ministries led by the Social Democrats, the junior party in his coalition – and political competitors.“TI does not have any evidence for their words because there cannot be any evidence. I fully respect the law,” he said.

And it is only six miles from the West Bank village where the family who agreed to be filmed for the project live.“On the surface, the exhibition is not threatening, it’s almost even naive. But I think the under-layer is very tragic, disappointing,” the artist, Daniel Landau, said.It is part of a exhibition in the museum’s youth wing that explores human encounters, with other works placing the spotlight on the impact of smartphones on relationships or interactions with strangers in the street.Landau’s room, called “Visitors”, has been sliced down the middle, with one side decorated like the home of a Jewish family and the other as a Palestinian home. Virtual reality glasses give visitors a 360-degree view of the homes and they can listen to stories from family members.More than 200,000 people have visited in the past three months, said Landau, who has often gone to hear feedback. “The initial response is that they say: ‘I’ve never been into an Arab house. I’ve never met Arab people. I’m surprised to see how family-like they are.’”Israelis and Palestinians – societies that once knew each other intimately – have never been as physically ided as they are today. After two intifadas, Israeli military crackdowns and ensuing bloodshed, there have been moves for complete separation.Israel has built a concrete barrier and barred most Palestinians from entering. It has banned its own citizens from entering Palestinian-controlled West Bank cities. Gaza, which is geographically disconnected from the West Bank, has been put under blockade and few can leave.Even in Israel’s majority-Arab cities, and in Jerusalem, there is little interaction between neighbours. Palestinian anti-Israel boycott movements have gathered strength and among Israelis, “coexistence” is often considered a politically loaded and isive term.The two families Landau filmed for the project live just tens of metres apart but have never met because they are separated by the wall that ides the West Bank. Landau said the Palestinian family had been granted special permits to travel into Israel to visit the museum this month.Inspired by his experience of growing up in a Jewish Jerusalem area where he had a friend in a nearby Palestinian village, Landau had hoped to find families there for his project, but he said the situation was too tense.A large part of the work, Landau said, was to touch on internal rifts in Israeli society, namely its Jewish population from the Middle East and north Africa whose “Arabness” had been sidelined.Mizrahi Jews were expelled from Arab countries or chose to immigrate to Israel after its creation. But they have long faced economic, cultural and political marginalisation from the Ashkenazi elite of European origin.This had led to an “impossibility encapsulated in the Israeli society. This kind of lovehate. This kind of appreciation for the east but actually a sort of rejection.“It’s the story of the Arab Jew. Half of us are very connected to Arab culture, language, music, mentally,” he said. “That’s what I wish we could bring – more empathy, accepting to the local culture. The potential of what could happen when we cooperate. Rather than bringing western values, consumer culture into this meeting point.”Landau said he noticed that Mizrahi Jews who experienced the virtual reality homes had felt nostalgic. “They say: ‘That’s how my grandfather used to decorate his house, that’s how he used to talk about his kids.’”Raji Sebteen, 55, the Palestinian man who had his home and family filmed for the project, said the exhibition was a “good way to ask others to believe in peace”.“It’s a good feeling,” he said, when asked about the thousands of Israelis who had now seen inside his home.“You have to understand that people are fearful. They are scared because of the situation … because of mistrust planted inside them, it is not easy,” he said, adding that any Israeli would be welcome to visit his home in real life.Ido Harari, a 43-year-old Israeli academic visiting the museum with his young daughters, said hostility had grown between both sides and attempts to return to a pre-state situation where Arabs and Jews mingled was “a bit romantic”.“I don’t know how much it is based on actual possibilities we have today. I have Arab acquaintances, not Arab friends, unfortunately. I don’t know if you would get invited,” he said.“Me and my friends are on the left side of the left wing. We don’t think of ourselves as Zionists. Our goal is one state with Jews and Arabs living as equals together. Still, most of our friends, they are not close friends with Arabs.”As his eight-year-old held the goggles up to her face, Harari said: “My daughter is really excited about this room. So it probably works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4b0a2a6f2aabc82407aed1b555294a21b992c5/0_122_3834_2300/master/3834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78ed63276273b5bcbb37c44764697946","title":"jacinda ardern neve female mps recreate 1905 image new zealand","story":"125 years after women first voted in elections, the country’s female MPs gather for a symbolic photographFemale New Zealand MPs have celebrated suffrage day by recreating a famous photograph from 1905 shot in the country’s parliament featuring no women.Instead of an all-male lineup, it features 39 of the country’s 46 women MPs.Jacinda Ardern – the country’s third female prime minister – sat front and centre in the modern update, cradling her infant daughter Neve Te Aroha on her lap.“What a difference 113 years makes!” tweeted Green MP Golriz Ghrahraman, New Zealand’s first refugee MP, who featured in the updated photograph taken on Wednesday.The black and white picture taken in the reading room of the parliamentary library in 1905 captured 23 men in three-piece suits.

Our analysis suggests that a large majority of migrants from the EU employed in the UK would not meet the criteria proposed by the MAC.Officially known as the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill, this will be the primary piece of legislation to enact the agreement the UK secures to leave the EU, and the ensuing transition period.That depends on what the final deal is. A white paper published on Tuesday mainly takes in areas already dealt with by the initial agreement with the EU – reciprocal citizens’ rights, the transition period, and the orce bill.Only after parliament has approved the deal negotiated with the EU. It must then be passed before 29 March 2019, so the withdrawal agreement has legal effect.Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, reiterated his warning the UK could withhold the £39bn final settlement if the EU fails to agree a trade deal. He also said there would be “no wholesale removal of rights of EU nationals” if there was no deal. He also said the implementation bill would reinstate parts of the European Communities Act – which first took the UK into the then common market – which is being repealed by the EU Withdrawal Act, so EU law can still apply during the transition.“While of course EU citizens currently in the UK will be protected by the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, the MAC’s recommendations would have significant implications for future EU migrants. Overall, these proposals would see a major shake-up for our immigration system, with sectors such as hospitality, logistics and wholesale feeling the squeeze.”Morris said the IPPR would support a different approach to managing migration post-Brexit. “Rather than simply cutting off low-skilled EU labour, the government should consider ways to incentivise employers to pay more and train more, by offering advantages in the visa system to responsible businesses,” he said.The MAC report shut down a wide range of claims made about the impact of immigration in the run-up to the Brexit referendum.The experts found that the overall impact of migration from the European Economic Area was “small in magnitude when set against other changes”, adding that “migrants have no or little impact” on the employment or unemployment outcomes of the UK-born workforce, and that migration does not force down wages to “any great extent”.The advisers also found that the fall of the pound after the referendum, driven by uncertainty over the future of the UK economy, has had a larger impact on wages and employment opportunities than migration ever did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad3070511f1d86d20c49c1eb3cd50b0e5b646d04/0_1329_3648_2186/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07ac56feb66cba9e9748226ae9eab167","title":"shinzo abe set to be japans longest serving pm after winning party vote","story":"Reelection as Liberal Democratic leader means Abe is likely to overtake previous record and use mandate to revise pacifist constitutionAbe’s victory – taking 553 votes out of a total of 807 – means he is assured of continuing as prime minister and is expected to use his mandate to push ahead with controversial plans to strengthen the legal status of Japan’s military, known as the self-defence forces.Speaking on the eve of the vote among LDP MPs and party members, Abe said he was determined to “build a new country together”, adding: “I promise to take the lead in handing over a proud and hopeful Japan to younger generations.”Abe, a conservative who has devoted his political career to loosening the postwar shackles on the self-defence forces, easily beat his nearest rival, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, who had voiced concern that the country had not been given enough time to debate constitutional reform.Abe’s victory on Thursday effectively extends his term in office by another three years. If he is still in office in November 2019 he will overtake Taro Katsura, who was leader for 2,886 days – spread over three terms – in the early 1900s.Abe, who has survived two cronyism scandals, spent a tumultuous year in office from late 2006, but has not lost an election since he became prime minister for a second time in December 2012.He has quietly dropped plans for a comprehensive revision to the war-renouncing clause in the constitution, insisting he simply wants to confirm the legality of the self-defence forces, which are not recognised by the current document.He has also said he would retain passages that forbid Japan from waging a war of aggression.Article 9 of the current constitution, authored by US occupation forces at the end of the second world war, renounces war and forbids the use of force to settle international disputes.Abe, however, redefined the military’s role three years age with the passage of a law allowing it to take part in collective-self defence. In theory, that means Japanese troops could come to the aid of an ally under attack even if its own territory is not threatened.The constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Japanese Diet and a simple majority in a national referendum.Any move to strengthen the military’s status could damage Abe’s standing, however, particularly among older voters who have formed an emotional attachment to their country’s postwar pacifism.The change could also test Tokyo’s relationship with South Korea and China, both victims of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century.Analysts pointed out that most voters were more concerned about the economy and population decline.“They simply do not see revision as a top priority for the government and Diet,” said Tobias Harris, a Japan expert at Teneo Intelligence in Washington, adding that constitutional revision was a “costly distraction that could trigger a backlash vote”.Wire agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Large section of line is closed after gales knocked down trees and power cables close to Beechwood stationDUP MP narrowly avoids by-election following petition over Sri Lankan holidaysIngrida Maciokaite (31) died after being stabbed multiple times on TuesdayLeaders gather in Salzburg as Taoiseach outlines preparations for no-deal BrexitAlmost 90 sites in the city worth more than \u0026euro400m have been identifiedHealth committee told waiting period is unnecessary and without medical reasonRepak calls on Government to establish a plastics working group to oversee transitionMinister says \u0026lsquolegitimate\u0026rsquo concerns over BusConnects scheme will be remediedAuthor says long waiting lists mean people treated at later stage in illness, at higher costNo Irish deaths reported on Wednesday, which was \u0026lsquoEuropean day without a road death\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD says he is likely to vote for Se\u0026aacuten Gallagher in the presidential electionSome 67,000 remain without power after severe winds batter IrelandPolling centres for \u0026lsquorecall petition\u0026rsquo in North Antrim have closed, count to begin midnightMinister says garda\u0026iacute need support from public \u0026rsquonot intimidation or abuse\u0026rsquoMinister pledges full implementation plan for Scally recommendations within 3 monthsDoctors say Government tabled no concrete proposals at talks on WednesdayPlanes, trains and trams all cancelled due to high winds"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3634421.1537377064!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"opw reveals final headcount for papal mass in phoenix park","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Making their way to the Mass, celebrated by Pope Francis in the Phoenix Park, Dublin in August.

Photograph:  Colin Keegan, Collins DublinThe mystery of how many people attended the papal Mass in the Phoenix Park in August finally appears to have been solved.The Office of Public Works revealed on Wednesday that the final count was almost certainly just under 152,000, after pedestrians and those bussed to the venue were counted.The OPW released official count figures following an FOI request and said the number of pedestrians to enter the park on the day was 131,875.In addition to that, an estimated further 20,000 people travelled to the event by bus and were not officially subject to a headcount.On the day of the final Mass, the OPW had in place counting systems for health and safety reasons.“This data was critical for the egress after Mass as each gate had a flow capacity, and all had to be out of the park before sunset,” it said.The OPW said the 131,875 figure included only those who entered the site through monitored gates by foot.An information note explained: “In addition to those on foot, there were several thousand of attendees who entered the site by vehicle access through the unmonitored gates such as invited guests who were coached in, the choir, those involved in the Mass, and those availing of universal access.”The OPW said their best estimate of how many came in this way was “in the order of 20,000”.They said the maximum capacity for the event had ended up being 485,000 tickets, all of which were supposed to have been taken.The office explained: “When the ticket allocation was complete, the World Meeting of Families collated all of the information in conjunction with their ticking company, and gave an oral presentation, confirming that they had reached all their ticket targets.”In the immediate aftermath of the visit, neither gardaí nor the OPW said they were in a position to confirm exactly how many people had actually attended.However, they did confirm that attendance was lower than expected, which had made managing the event much easier than anticipated.On social media, some claimed that the crowd had barely topped 100,000 while commentators supportive of the Catholic Church said it was likely to have been in excess of 200,000.The turnout paled in comparison with the numbers that attended the Mass said by Pope John Paul II in 1979, when an estimated one million people turned up.The poor attendance for the event was blamed on a variety of factors, including poor weather on the day and also the distance that people would have to walk to get there.Separately, warnings for those suffering from health problems as well as reports about the spread of contagious diseases may have put off others.In addition, an unknown number of tickets were block-booked by protesters who took large numbers of tickets without having any intention of attending.One man, part of the “Say Nope to the Pope” Facebook page, claimed to have got 800 tickets in this manner, including booking several tickets in the name of “Jesus Christ”.Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

Photograph: Jack TaylorGetty ImagesStark isions over Brexit and the future of the Irish Border were evident at an EU summit in Salzburg last night as British prime minister Theresa May told fellow leaders that a border on the Irish Sea was “simply not acceptable” to her.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters that no progress had been made on the backstop since March and that the Government was making preparations for a no-deal outcome in the talks on the UK’s departure from the bloc.“I don’t think anyone wants to contemplate a no-deal scenario,” he said. “I don’t believe a no-deal scenario is where we’re heading but certainly Ireland is prepared for it.“We’ve already started the process of hiring hundreds of people to staff our ports and airports. We’ve already started to approve the IT system, the infrastructure that may need to go into place. I want to emphasise that’s in the ports and airports for eastwest trade. We’re not making any preparations for a hard border.”Ahead of the dinner, sources said Ms May would tell her fellow leaders that: “It has been clear from the outset that we can never accept a border on the Irish Sea. . . A customs border would undermine our constitutional position.”She was also expected to say that “the commission is proposing I should assent to legal separation of the UK into two customs territories. That is simply not acceptable”.This was seen as a response to attempts by the chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier to “de-dramatise” the issue of controls on the Irish Sea in the event of Northern Ireland remaining part of the customs union and single market after Brexit. Mr Barnier has insisted in recent weeks that such controls need not take place on the Border or be seen as a border, or have any implications for the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.Ms May was having none of it, with sources saying she remained solidly committed to the British pledge in December to a “backstop” for Northern Ireland, which both sides differ sharply on the shape of.Sources close to the prime minister accepted, however, that London would be bringing forward proposals on the regulatory control dimension of their backstop proposals and did not rule out that some such controls could be carried out in the Irish Sea.On the overall deal Ms May was expected to reiterate her commitment to getting agreement. “We have a shared history, and shared challenges . . . and we have a desire for a shared future,” she said. “The onus is on all of us to get this deal done.”There were no responses at the dinner to Ms May’s speech, which will be discussed by the 27 remaining states at their lunch today after she leaves Salzburg. Ms May and Mr Varadkar will hold a bi-lateral meeting this morning.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

I have written before about the unreliability of a substantial fraction of the current scientific literature, ranging from outright fraud to slap-dash work prematurely published that cannot be replicated by other scientists.There has also been a recent explosion of “predatory” science journals that aggressively solicit research papers from scientists who pay to have the papers published. These journals claim they use the highest standards of peer review, but most subject submitted papers to little or no review. This undermines the credibility of scientific publishing.This problem is highlighted by a recent hoax perpetrated by Dr Gary Lewis, senior lecturer in psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London. Dr Lewis submitted a ridiculous fictitious research paper to a typical predatory journal to test “how low the bar for publication might be”. He tells the story in The Conversation (July 20th, 2018), an independent newscommentary website produced by academics and journalists.A well-known theory in social psychology, called unconscious social priming, proposes that words or concepts can prime our behaviour, eg saying words associated with old-age to people, such as “bingo”, makes them walk more slowly afterwards. Based on this concept, Lewis composed a fictitious study to test the hypothesis that right-wing politicians wipe their bottoms with the opposite hand to that used by left-wing politicians. Since the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body, and vice versa, Lewis specifically hypothesised that right-wing politicians wipe their bums with their left hands and left-wing politicians wipe with their right hands.A fictional research assistant asked known left- and right-leaning members of the UK House of Parliament what hand they used. Nine politicians were interviewed, including a “Boris Johnski” and a “Teresa Maybe”, but only eight answers were usable because one subject, a “Nigel F Arage”, rudely told the researcher to “bog off”.The data collected from these eight politicians, after “sophisticated” statistical analysis, fully confirmed the hypothesis. Lewis wrote up the paper – “Testing Inter-Hemispheric Social Priming Theory in a Sample of Professional Politicians – a Brief Report” by Gerry Jay Louis, Institute of Interdisciplinary Political and Faecal Science, England, and submitted it for publication.A prompt email reply informed him his manuscript was under review. A few days later the journal informed him it was accepted for publication and asked him to pay $581 publishing costs. Lewis pleaded that he had no funds and the journal waived all charges.The article was promptly published, but when The Conversation contacted the publisher for comment the article was retracted. The publisher told The Conversation: “We strictly follow double blinded peer process for all the articles we receive.” Lewis received no peer review comments from the journal. But, in any event, the idea that this paper was reviewed at all is simply not credible. Was the paper even read? You don’t have to be an expert to see that the paper is entirely ridiculous – eg N  8. I urge you to read this short paper here – it is a laugh-out-loud piece and I congratulate Dr Lewis on his comic talent.Of course, nobody claims all papers published in predatory journals are worthless. Some of these journals operate conventional review processes and, also, some researchers submit high-quality papers to predatory journals thinking they are submitting to journals using conventional reviewing procedures. More than 5,000 UK scientists have published articles in the past five years in these journals.But, as Lewis points out, the overall problem with predatory journals is they contaminate the scientific literature by presenting many studies of unacceptable quality as rigorous scientific reports. Dodgy work published in these journals, for example on climate change, genetic modification, alternative medicine and so on, can then be quoted as scientific evidence in public debates.There is no shortage of science journals that employ rigorous peer review. The international scientific academies should prepare and publicise a list of all these journals, keep it updated, and make it plain it is expected that all serious scientific research will be published in these outlets.William Reville is an emeritus professor of biochemistry at University College Cork"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3635023.1537394945!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may trying to strike right note at eu leaders travelling roadshow","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May, in Salzburg, Austria, on Wednesday. Photograph: Stefan WermuthBloomberg“The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.” – Wolfgang Amadeus MozartEuropean leaders’ travelling roadshow pitched up on Wednesday all too briefly in the most picturesque of Austria’s Alpine cities, Salzburg, the birthplace of Mozart.And so, pace Wolfgang, it would seem apposite – even journalistically mandatory – to misquote the master on the similar musical cadences of the EU summits process.Despite the razzmatazz, in reality almost all of the agenda and decisions of summits have been crafted and shaped beforehand, their conclusions, formulated, Is dotted and Ts crossed by silent diplomats. Even at an “informal”, when there are not supposed to be any decisions anyway.So we can predict with some confidence that there will be no breakthrough on Brexit. Theresa May will have addressed EU leaders on Wednesday night and urged on them the flexibility she will have said she has manifested in her Chequers proposals.And today, over lunch, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier will again brief the 27 others on the stalled state of play of negotiations, Ms May having departed. In the words of European Council president Donald Tusk’s widely circulated letter of invitation, they will then“reconfirm the need for a legally operational backstop on Ireland, so as to be sure that there will be no hard Border in the future”.Breaking with the policy of not taking decisions, they will then agree to his suggestion – perhaps with demurs from the Irish – that they need to give the Brexit talks a little more time, so they will come together again in November. October’s “moment of truth”, in Michel Barnier’s words, will just be “a moment of truth”.But the 27 will also start an important and difficult discussion on the shape and scope of the political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship which is supposed to accompany the final legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement when it is agreed in November.This will set the tone and parameters of the talks that can only begin when the UK is no longer a member.The UK – which has shown its hand in the form of its Chequers white paper – hopes that the declaration can be general and probably largely aspirational, to be filled out by talks after they depart at the end of March. There is no time for it to be more, they are saying.Ms May will, however, want some political cover to justify what may be a controversial backstop U-turn. Kind words about the potential of Chequers would be nice, but unrealistic.Mindful of the experience of last December’s joint agreement in which, under the imperative of getting further talks moving, May was persuaded to give a solemn promise – instantly regretted – to guarantee a backstop for Northern Ireland, London will be anxious to avoid further hostages to fortune in the political declaration. Solemn and binding commitments are out, not least because they would involve dangerous political juggling back home.The 27 leaders are likely to want more solid commitments.And then there will be two related discussions on progress made – or not made – in implementing the June summit’s ideas on external and internal security.Three years after the culmination of the migration crisis, the arrivals on all three main Mediterranean migratory routes are down by 92 per cent. But the migration crisis has become a political crisis pitching Italy’s radical new government with Hungary into battle against the northern states over how to stem illegal migration.Leaders will get reports from the Austrian presidency on progress made – slow – since the fractious June summit on developing the idea of reception centres in third countries and dedicated disembarkation points in the EU where asylum seekers would be quickly processed.They will also discuss commission proposals to beef up the EU’s Border Agency by 10,000 staff, with some member states sceptical about the need and demanding changes of governance to the agency. Commission proposals to legally require online platforms to take down terrorist content within an hour of notification will also be debated."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/19/TELEMMGLPICT000175068023_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"behind shutter james oatway photographing south africas red","story":"A Red Ants major carries out two small children during the eviction of residents of a so-called hijacked building in Bree Street, JohannesburgBehind the ShutterThis dramatic image shows a man​ carrying two small children by their arms during an eviction operation in Bree Street, Johannesburg. ​The man is a ​major in the Red Ants​,​​ a private eviction and security firm based in South Africa\u0027s biggest city​ recognisable by their trademark red overalls and helmets​.On arrival the Red Ants gave residents an opportunity to grab what they could and leave the building.Sikhumbuzo Dlamini, a major in the Red Ants, picked up these two shellshocked children and moved them away from the entrance.

General Assembly gathering of world leaders, Pompeo said Washington invited Pyongyang\u0027s representatives to meet the US special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, in Vienna at the earliest opportunity.Mr Pompeo cited Kim\u0027s decision to complete the previously announced dismantlement of the (Dongchang-ri) site in the presence of US and international inspectors as a step toward the final fully verified denuclearisation of North Korea.Some US officials were deeply skeptical. Speaking before Pompeo\u0027s announcement, two senior US officials involved in US-North Korea policy voiced fears that Kim was trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul.Beyond the pomp and pageantry, Moon is keeping delicate denuclearisation talks with North Korea on trackAt the summit, the two Koreas agreed on plans to resume economic cooperation, including working to reconnect rail and road links. They agreed as well to restart a joint factory park in a border city and tours to the North\u0027s Mount Kumgang resort.US officials suggested Kim was trying to ease the economic pressure on him to curb his nuclear programs and to undercut the rationale for US troops being based in South Korea by improving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.The United States has some 28,500 US troops in South Korea to deter North Korean attack. Pyongyang has long sought their withdrawal and Trump has questioned their rationale and cost..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There is nothing the North has offered so far that would constitute irreversible movement toward denuclearisationUS intelligence officialThere is nothing the North has offered so far that would constitute irreversible movement toward denuclearisation, however you define that, by January 2021 or any other time, or even a reduction of the military threat it poses to the South and the region, said a US intelligence official.Everything that’s out there now is conditional on US actions that would reduce the pressure on the North to cooperate or (is) filled with loopholes and exit ramps, added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.US officials said the ambiguity about what Washington was supposed to do for the North to close its nuclear complex at Yongbyon gave Kim room to argue that Washington had not done enough for North Korea to follow through on its pledges.Even if North Korea were to shut down Yongbyon, officials and experts believe it has other secret nuclear facilities.South Korea\u0027s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said the reciprocal US steps could include an end-of-war declaration. South Korea and the United States remain technically at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in gesture as they watch a gymnastic and artistic performance at the May Day Stadium on September 19, 2018 in PyongyangDespite the doubts of US officials and outside analysts, North Korea\u0027s pledge at the summit with the South Korean president drew an enthusiastic response from Trump.In late August, Trump abruptly canceled Pompeo\u0027s planned trip to North Korea, publicly acknowledging for the first time that his effort to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled since he met Kim in Singapore.Satellite images and other evidence in recent months have suggested North Korea is continuing to work on its nuclear program clandestinely.Speaking before Pompeo\u0027s comments, Trump‏ welcomed Kim\u0027s pledges, calling them part of tremendous progress with Pyongyang on a number of fronts, and hailing very good news from the summit between the Koreas.He\u0027s calm, I\u0027m calm - so we\u0027ll see what happens, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea, told reporters.North Korea – pictures show life behind the headlinesSpeaking in Pyongyang, the two Korean leaders agreed to turn the Korean peninsula into a land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats.Kim pledged to work toward the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula during two meetings with Moon earlier this year and at his summit with Trump.But discussions over how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered and North Korea has consistently refused to give up its nuclear arsenal unilaterally.Washington has demanded concrete action, such as a full disclosure of North Korea\u0027s nuclear and missile facilities, before agreeing to Pyongyang\u0027s key goals, including an easing of international sanctions and an official end to the Korean War.While North Korea has stopped nuclear and missile tests in the past year, it did not allow international inspections of its dismantling of its Punggye-ri nuclear test site in May, drawing criticism that its action was for show and could be reversed.The day after the June 12 Trump-Kim summit, Pompeo said he hoped to achieve major disarmament by North Korea by the end of Trump’s first term in January 2021.His latest statement that the process should be completed by January 2021 may be a signal Washington will not wait forever.The statement clearly implies that inter-Korean summits and theatrical promises to dismantle the odd facility simply can’t substitute for a negotiating process on the nuclear issue, said the Asia Society Policy Institute\u0027s Daniel Russel.Invoking the end of Trump’s term in January 2021 is another way of saying to the North that American patience is not unlimited and that Kim Jong Un won’t be able to sidestep denuclearization indefinitely, Russel added.Please review our commenting policyComment: May misses what Thatcher understood: people want a home of their ownSNP ministers \u0026#39unlikely\u0026#39 to meet target of superfast broadband for every home by 2021, says auditThis conference season, don\u0026#39t miss out on Front Bench, The \u0026#39s morning politics newsletterBritain is willing to walk away without a deal, Theresa May warns EU leaders in SalzburgSmoking will be \u0026#39eradicated in England by 2030\u0026#39Comment: Big tech\u0026#39s suppression of conservative voices is the greatest threat to free speech we faceComment: It is not just illegal immigrants who should be worried by the Trump administration\u0026#39s get tough policyShrewsbury baby scandal at maternity unit expands to 100 casesProblem with migrants?

The new chain\u0026nbsphas been the subject of weeks of speculation. It\u0026nbspis the result of more than two years of planning, working with over 350 supplier partners, and at a launch in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, on Wednesday, the focus was on the “Britishness” of the brand and lower prices. Jack’s will be the “cheapest in town”, according to the supermarket’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, through a combination of deals agreed with suppliers and lower operating costs at its pared back stores. “It’s very simple to run, it allows us to lower prices,” he said. Supply costs will be reduced due to changes to packaging, but no products will be supplied to Jack’s at a lower value than they are sold to Tesco, Mr Lewis said.The new stores will also offer a much smaller range of products than a traditional Tesco branch, with around 2,600 against the tens of thousands on sale in Tesco. Of the 2,600 product lines, 1,800 will be Jack’s own-brand. Meanwhile, eight out of ten products at Jack’s will be made, grown or reared in Britain, and most of the packaging reflects this, with Union Jacks adorning several items. This focus on Britishness has “nothing at all” to do with Brexit, Mr Lewis said, but reflects customers’ preference for locally sourced food and drink.Jack’s will be targeting “price sensitive customers”, and will\u0026nbspopen accordingly in areas with poorer populations.The Chatteris store has been created at a site previously earmarked for a new Tesco, which was mothballed four years ago, and the Immingham, Lincolnshire branch, which also opens on Thursday, uses a similar space. Of the 10 to 15 Jack’s shops planned for next year, five of them will be repurposed Tesco properties, some of which will be mothballed sites, but most of which will be current Tesco  stores.Tesco expected to launch new discount storesJamie Oliver is the new face of TescoCan Tesco\u0027s discounter Jack\u0027s succeed where others have failed? In terms of competing, Mr Lewis said he is not concerned about the risk of losing custom from Tesco to Jack’s: “I’d rather cannibalise myself than have somebody else cannibalise me.”As if to prove this belief, the company will open at least one Jack’s “right beside a Tesco”.In terms of competing with Aldi and Lidl, which are rapidly eating up market share in the highly competitive supermarket space, Jack’s will offer the lowest prices within the local area around each store, rather than competing on a national level. The new brand will not offer any online element, aside from an in-store app which will allow customers to scan products as they shop.The group said no jobs will be lost through the creation of Jack’s, although some staff took voluntary redundancy rather than staying on as Jack’s employees or moving to another Tesco site.The company said between 20 and 25 jobs will be created per new Jack’s store, meaning the total number of new roles created could reach 375.\u0026nbspHowever, the lower price offering will also mean lower wages for staff, Mr Lewis said, “because working conditions will be different”. Employees will be offered a base rate of pay, rather than the usual benefits package Tesco staff get. The Jack’s brand is being launched as part of the group’s centenary celebrations, and has been named in honour of Tesco founder Jack Cohen.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/10/13/university-graduates.jpg","title":"students clearing universities a level results day scramble degree places","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Universities feeling the pinch will have taken generous view of entry qualifications\u0026nbspto fill places\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA record number of students have taken up places on degrees through clearing this year, official figures show,\u0026nbspas universities were left scrambling to fill vacancies on courses. \u0026nbspOne month after A-level results day, 60,100 people have found places at British\u0026nbspuniversities using\u0026nbspthe process,\u0026nbspaccording to figures released by Ucas university admissions service.The number of students placed in a UK university after applying directly through clearing,\u0026nbsprather than through the main scheme,\u0026nbsprose by 6 per cent, from 13,640 last year to a record 14,410.Universities have been competing to attract would-be students amid a fall in applications, which has been fuelled by a decline in the UK’s 18-year-old population\u0026nbspand uncapped student numbers.This summer, there were still places available on degree courses at elite universities through clearing – as they\u0026nbsptried to recruit students who pay up to £9,250 a year in tuition fees.Professor\u0026nbspAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, told The Independent: “Universities lower down the pecking order will have been feeling the pinch and will have had to take a more generous view of entry qualifications in order to fill their places.”But he added that students would also have taken the opportunity to “trade up” through clearing – amid a falling population and a rise in university degree places on offer.“Tuition fee income is essential for universities to balance their books and in the circumstances I think that analysis would show that universities are both admitting applicants on lower A-level grades and taking a wider range of qualifications and experience into account,” he said.In total, 426,730 students from the UK were placed at UK universities – a drop of 3 per cent on the same point last year, the latest Ucas figures show.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the higher education regulator Office for Students, said: “With record numbers of clearing places available and no cap on students numbers, prospective students can choose provision which suits their circumstances and ambition.“It’s important that universities and colleges consider how they can best improve the choice and flexibility of the courses they offer. Crucially, prospective students should have access to excellent information, advice and guidance in order to understand what options are available.\u0026nbspThis will help ensure that people from all ages and all backgrounds can make the most of the life-changing opportunities offered by higher education.”UK news in picturesStorm Ali has hit the British Isles bringing winds of up to 100mph.

The new chain\u0026nbsphas been the subject of weeks of speculation. It\u0026nbspis the result of more than two years of planning, working with over 350 supplier partners, and at a launch in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, on Wednesday, the focus was on the “Britishness” of the brand and lower prices. Jack’s will be the “cheapest in town”, according to the supermarket’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, through a combination of deals agreed with suppliers and lower operating costs at its pared back stores. “It’s very simple to run, it allows us to lower prices,” he said. Supply costs will be reduced due to changes to packaging, but no products will be supplied to Jack’s at a lower value than they are sold to Tesco, Mr Lewis said.The new stores will also offer a much smaller range of products than a traditional Tesco branch, with around 2,600 against the tens of thousands on sale in Tesco. Of the 2,600 product lines, 1,800 will be Jack’s own-brand. Meanwhile, eight out of ten products at Jack’s will be made, grown or reared in Britain, and most of the packaging reflects this, with Union Jacks adorning several items. This focus on Britishness has “nothing at all” to do with Brexit, Mr Lewis said, but reflects customers’ preference for locally sourced food and drink.Jack’s will be targeting “price sensitive customers”, and will\u0026nbspopen accordingly in areas with poorer populations.The Chatteris store has been created at a site previously earmarked for a new Tesco, which was mothballed four years ago, and the Immingham, Lincolnshire branch, which also opens on Thursday, uses a similar space. Of the 10 to 15 Jack’s shops planned for next year, five of them will be repurposed Tesco properties, some of which will be mothballed sites, but most of which will be current Tesco  stores.Tesco expected to launch new discount storesJamie Oliver is the new face of TescoCan Tesco\u0027s discounter Jack\u0027s succeed where others have failed? In terms of competing, Mr Lewis said he is not concerned about the risk of losing custom from Tesco to Jack’s: “I’d rather cannibalise myself than have somebody else cannibalise me.”As if to prove this belief, the company will open at least one Jack’s “right beside a Tesco”.In terms of competing with Aldi and Lidl, which are rapidly eating up market share in the highly competitive supermarket space, Jack’s will offer the lowest prices within the local area around each store, rather than competing on a national level. The new brand will not offer any online element, aside from an in-store app which will allow customers to scan products as they shop.The group said no jobs will be lost through the creation of Jack’s, although some staff took voluntary redundancy rather than staying on as Jack’s employees or moving to another Tesco site.The company said between 20 and 25 jobs will be created per new Jack’s store, meaning the total number of new roles created could reach 375.\u0026nbspHowever, the lower price offering will also mean lower wages for staff, Mr Lewis said, “because working conditions will be different”. Employees will be offered a base rate of pay, rather than the usual benefits package Tesco staff get. The Jack’s brand is being launched as part of the group’s centenary celebrations, and has been named in honour of Tesco founder Jack Cohen.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/12/16/sleep-pods.jpg","title":"sleep napping sleeponomics korea sleepology science nap pods sleeping","story":"Created with Sketch.Our technologically-fuelled\u0026nbsplives\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspexhausting us, but they are also\u0026nbspdriving the market of sleep. Jessica Brown investigates whether the commodification of sleep is just a fad, or if the booming industry really can help us get some shut-eyeClick to followThe IndependentPodtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years agoIn these wellness-obsessed times, the tried-and-tested basics of fruit, vegetables, sleep and exercise just aren’t enough anymore.From the moment we wake up and scroll through social media, we’re inundated with ads tempting us with lotions, drinks and devices that promise to make us mentally and physically healthier, many of which have questionable claims. (Detox juices and appetite-suppressing lollipops, I’m looking at you.) \u0026nbspThe latest commodity we’re being persuaded to invest in\u0026nbspis products to help us sleep, fuelled by a booming “sleeponomics”\u0026nbspindustry in a sleep-deprived South Korea. But while it may seem like we’re getting a lot less shut-eye than we used to in the UK, according to most research we’re not getting any less now than we have done in recent history. \u0026nbspIt might feel that way, since we’re\u0026nbspall a lot more anxious and stressed these days, tuned into the blue light of our devices until late at night, and in increasingly demanding jobs where we feel obliged to answer emails 247.Work has a huge role to play in how little sleep we’re getting lines are becoming blurrier between work and home, we’re travelling more and commuting further, and working more overtime –\u0026nbspthe nine\u0026nbspto five\u0026nbspjob feels like a thing of the past.But while technology and work are making us tired, they’re also driving the market for sleep. No longer will a good mattress and some chamomile tea suffice when we can cuddle up to sleep robots, use devices to measure our sleep, assess the lighting and temperature of our bedrooms, and adjust the firmness of our beds – all through an app. \u0026nbspMattresses aren’t just mattresses anymore –\u0026nbspthey’re a lifestyle, and sleep is an industry, targeting everyone from the mildly tired to the insomniacs. London’s even hosting the capital’s only sleep exhibition next month, with consultations and talks dedicated to the art of sleeping well.While some may argue it’s good to have a market for all our sleep ailments, an industry steeped in promises leaves potential for disappointment. And for an industry so lacking regulation, this potential is high. \u0026nbspDreem, a headband that promises to make you go to sleep faster, for example, states on its website it has conducted “internal research”, however, this research doesn’t seem to be published anywhere, and there’s a very slim chance that it’s peer-reviewed.As one research paper published by US-based scientists points out, the most popular consumer sleep technologies, sleep tracking apps worn on the wrist as you sleep and alarm clocks such as Sleep Cycle, may actually cause sleep disruption from noise and light pollution. “Many sleep tracking apps require user activation and device placement on the mattress to monitor sleep,” the paper states. \u0026nbspJournalist Caroline Christie describes herself as a terrible sleeper, and says she stopped using a sleep app after it started making her anxious and reminding her when she was sleep deprived. “It also made me quite competitive, wanting to make sure I kept getting the right numbers of hours,” she says. “I’ve come to accept it all comes down to routine, and doing what it takes to make you feel relaxed and able to switch off.” \u0026nbspThere’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about itAnother concern, the paper states, is the lack of validation studies, FDA approval, and endorsement from American Academy of Sleep Medicine-accredited sleep facilities or sleep specialists. “Practically speaking, lack of validation may be premeditated by some developers, who run the risk of their technology being debunked or labelled inferior if compared to clinical standards,” it states. \u0026nbspAnd in terms of their reliability of measuring sleep or diagnosing sleep disorders, a wrist device hardly compares to the standards of a clinical sleep evaluation\u0026nbspa process which can involve being constantly monitored by technologists, who use\u0026nbspan electrocardiogram\u0026nbspwith more than 20 sensors to record breathing, brain and heart activity over a full night.Christie says, however, that she invested in some products recently to help her sleep\u0026nbspand drown out the sounds of her flatmates –\u0026nbspand they seem to be helping. “About six months ago, I invested in a Bluetooth eye mask that helps me block out surrounding noise and light. Now, it’s part of my sleep routine and helps my body realise it’s time to sleep. It’s comforting, easy to use, and helps me disconnect and drift off.” \u0026nbspShutterstock)However, sleep expert James Wilson, who advises workplaces, sports teams and families on their sleep, describes the market for sleep as “quite superficial,” and the lack of research, he says, has led to some dodgy practices: “There’s lots of snake oil being sold, products making claims they can’t prove. Some of these products have a lot to answer for – they don’t give a solution.”Wilson argues that part of the problem is that the industry doesn’t have a professional body, and needs more science to help people like him become more credible. He spent his teens suffering with insomnia and in work to help others in similar situations, but found a lack of options down an academic route\u0026nbspand started his career working at a charity that supports families with children that have sleeping problems.“There’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about it, I want there to be a practical qualification,” he says.While there are tens of thousands of nutritionists in the UK, there are very few sleep experts, and Wilson argues medical professionals aren’t trained enough to properly recognise and diagnose sleep problems.“Medical students don’t have much sleep knowledge, but sleep is fundamental to life.

Nap pod manufacturer Podtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years ago, predominantly to employers including Facebook and Nestle, whom director Paul Grindrod says are slowly coming around to the idea of napping on the job. \u0026nbspBut it took a while the company didn’t sell a single pod in its first few years, and one local authority cancelled its order with Podtime on the request of its ruling authority due to the stigma attached to napping at work. “We’re gradually overcoming this resistance, as people see the benefits to productivity.There was a time when office buildings didn’t have showers, but now many do,” he says. Grindrod, who likes to read his Kindle inside the pod, says the company doesn’t hire any scientists or commission any research, and tells clients to go online to see the benefits of sleep more generally.\u0026nbspBCIT) in Vancouver, Canada (Alamy)Wilson, however, says installing nap pods is “one of the worst things you can do,” and can exacerbate insomnia. “We have two internal systems that manage sleep: light and dark, and our internal sleep pressure, which counts down to bedtime from the moment we wake up,” he says.“Naps knock bedtime back. Using a nap pod sounds like the right thing to do, and people are doing it because they don’t know any better, but it’s not right for everyone”.Wilson argues that this is why a lot of the advice on sleep isn’t relevant – because it comes down to each inidual and how they sleep best. Headlines warning us that too little sleep causes almost every health problem under the sun aren’t helpful either, he argues, because one of the biggest reasons we can’t sleep is stress.One in seven of British couples prefer to sleep in separate bedsBad night’s sleep makes you fat and weak, study showsWhat happens when you try to catch up on sleep over the weekend“Warnings about how bad sleep is killing us means we wake up stressed in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. We need to get people more relaxed about sleep,” he says. While it’s a nice sentiment, the booming sleep industry is likely to keep insisting there’s a problem to solve, especially if the beauty industry and the “help”\u0026nbspit offers consumers to “fix”\u0026nbspblackheads and cellulite, is anything to go by.Robinson likens the quality of our sleep to the efforts we put into other areas of life:\u0026nbsp“You could be fanatical about it and see a big improvement, or you can make some small differences and see some improvements. It’s the same as diet and exercise, it comes with a level of discipline.”The difference is, however, being sold the idea that we can solve our sleep problems with just a bit of effort and a lot of cash is deceiving. While we can all take steps to help us, it’s unlikely that a pillow mist or 20 minutes in a nap pod at work will cure a sleep disorder, and companies telling us they can will only make us more stressed out when we’re wide awake at 4am.

They now intend to examine the data in greater depth to learn more about the Milky Way’s history.“The discovery was easy the interpretations harder. And the full understanding of its meaning and implications might take several years,” Said Dr Amina Helmi from the University of Groningen, who also contributed to the research.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/08/07/11/maroon-5.jpg","title":"super bowl 2019 maroon 5 halftime show performer adam levine who","story":"Created with Sketch.Los Angeles based pop band to perform in AtlantaClick to followThe Independent CultureMaroon 5 formed in Los Angeles in the 1990s.

We’ve been having discussions on that with the EU for a number of months now.“We’ve always said that we will need to bring forward further proposals in relation to the regulatory aspects of the backstop. That will happen.”The official insisted that customs checks at ports would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the UK\u0026nbspand would not be drawn on why the Government did not consider regulatory checks to do so as well.Our only red line is that we are not treated any different from the rest of the United KingdomThe looming concession by the UK comes after months of work by negotiators on both sides to decide which if any checks could be moved away from ports in a bid to de-dramatise them.The Independent understands that some officials regard it as easier to move customs compliance checks away from ports, but not regulatory checks. The combination of concessions – with Britain accepting regulatory checks at ports and the EU moving some customs checks in-land – therefore appears to clear the path for a potential solution.\u0026nbspWhether the compromise backstop would get through the House of Commons is another matter. Mrs May has no majority without the DUP’s nine MPs, but the party’s leader, Arlene Foster, has said “our only red line is that we are not treated any different from the rest of the United Kingdom, that there are no trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland and our biggest market –\u0026nbspwhich, of course, is Great Britain”.Speaking of Mrs May over the summer, Ms Foster said: “I have confidence that she knows that she cannot bring forward anything that will breach that red line or we simply will not be able to support them.”The movement in talks comes after Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, warned the UK publicly that the UK policy on Ireland, as well as the PM’s Chequers proposals on trade, needed to be reworked and further negotiated.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Vote, are:* The motion to be put forward by the government shortly after any agreement has been reached with the EU, which could be amended* The statement promised if that motion is rejected, or if no agreement has been reached between the UK and EU by 21 January next year. The Commons speaker will determine whether this statement can be amended* The Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill – the full legislation to implement the exit deal – which will also be subject to amendmentsImmigration myths that fuelled Brexit blown apart by major reportBMW to shut UK plant for at least a month on day of BrexitPublic will be ‘harder to protect’ if UK leaves EU with no dealBrexit plan to bring in more non-EU workers risks modern slavery rise May has ‘failed to find solution’ to prevent hard border in Ireland* The prime minister deciding that, with Labour and Tory rebels poised to vote down her deal, a people’s vote is “the only way to secure a mandate”* Ms May deciding – having failed to strike a deal with the EU – that she has no option but to ask the public “whether the UK should leave the EU with no deal”* Legislation after a snap general election forced by the Brexit crisis – an outcome that “today seems very unlikely, but it is not inconceivable”, the report saysIt concludes: “If a people’s vote is not granted by parliament, it will not be due to procedural impediments or a lack of time, but because MPs have chosen not to take these opportunities.”Lord Kerr also repeated his insistence that the Article 50 notification could, if necessary, be revoked unilaterally to halt the Brexit process – a “cost free” option.Downing Street has been accused of suppressing legal advice that Article 50 can be withdrawn, even without Brussels’\u0026nbspagreement.The report also suggests the preferable question on the ballot paper for a fresh referendum would be a simple “the deal versus stay” or, if there is no agreement, “no deal versus stay”.The prime minister has repeatedly ruled out another public vote on Brexit, describing the idea as “a gross betrayal of our democracy”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email

migration theresa may people smugglers facebook eu salzburg summit","story":"Created with Sketch.Government hopes to cut migration off at the sourceClick to followIndy PoliticsThe Government is to crack down on people smugglers advertising their services to people in developing countries via Facebook in a bid to stem the flow of undocumented migrants to the UK at its source.The UK has identified 539 social media pages – the vast majority on Facebook – which it says are used by people illegally offering others transit to Europe.“We must now match our pursuit of people smugglers and traffickers with a renewed effort to prevent immigration crime from occurring in the first place,” Theresa May told EU leaders at a migration summit in Salzburg“To achieve this, we must tackle the enabling environment – all those factors that make it far too easy for criminal networks to emerge and grow, putting migrants’ lives at such risk.”Groups are openly advertising illegal transit services on Facebook with “travel agent” style ads, with some even offering discounts for children.The Government has tried to partly blame criminal gangs and “people smugglers” for refugees and migrants travelling to Europe.Many people are however fleeing conflict zones or economic and social turmoil and lack other means to reach Europe to claim asylum.\u0026nbspThe Government is also funding advertising and outreach campaigns in countries like Ethiopia and Sudan to convince would-be migrants that it is a bad idea to come to the UK.\u0026nbspSpeaking at the Salzburg summit the Prime Minister offered to share UK expertise on cyber-policing with other countries, stating that “online platforms have no respect for borders”.\u0026nbsp She said cooperation in this and other areas would be unaffected by Brexit. \u0026nbspThanks in part to populist governments exploiting the issue, migration is still at the top of the agenda at the EU level despite a massive fall in people trying to travel to Europe compared to previous year.\u0026nbspIn pictures: A day of refugee rescues in the Mediterranean SeaA baby being taken on to MSF\u0027s Bourbon Argos ship from a boat carrying

Treatment is patchy across the country and too often patients are misdiagnosed and not treated by specialists who can spot the signs.“Gambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment. We must also face up to the negative effect the explosion in gambling advertising has had.”The package follows a year-long consultation with charities, specialists in gambling addiction, gambling organisations and addicts themselves.It also comes as in-play betting becomes an increasingly prominent part of the gambling scene, with TV ads urging punters to place wagers on the next goalscorer or the final result.UK news in picturesStorm Ali has hit the British Isles bringing winds of up to 100mph.

It is our opinion that without gambling adverts there would be a lot less risk of initiating the young and the vulnerable to gambling activities by normalising a potentially harmful behaviour.”Labour meeting on deselection rule changes ends in stalemateSchools \u0027must be accountable for off-rolled pupils\u0027 exam results\u0027Labour activist claims party failing to tackle sexual harassmentOver 150 Brexit-related motions submitted ahead of Labour conferenceThe policy institute Money and Mental Health, which contributed to the review, said: “Adverts with specific offers, like free bets when registering for an online account, can lead consumers to gamble more than they intend to.“Their frequency and timing, such as late at night when people with mental health problems are vulnerable and more likely to respond, can create challenges to gambling responsibly.”Under Labour\u0027s proposals, bookmakers would still be able to offer odds on sporting events during play, but would not be allowed to advertise them for a specified period before and after games or during half-time or other breaks.A similar scheme floated in Australia would outlaw ads from five minutes before kick-off until five minutes after the final whistle.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/10/imran-khan-saudi.jpg","title":"imran khan saudi arabia pakistan prime minister medina muslim jidda","story":"Created with Sketch.Khan\u0027s choice of the kingdom for his first official visit, as well as comments from his finance minister, have led to speculation that Pakistan will seek a large loan from its Saudi allies to avoid another IMF bailoutClick to followThe IndependentImran Khan visits the Prophet\u0027s Mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, during his first overseas trip since taking officePakistan’s new prime minister\u0026nbspImran Khan\u0026nbspis meeting for talks with the king of\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia, amid speculation he\u0026nbspwill use his first official\u0026nbspvisit to request\u0026nbspfinancial aid.Comments from the former cricketer’s finance minister suggested Pakistan would turn to its major allies like China and Saudi Arabia, rather than rely on another bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Mr Khan arrived in the kingdom and prayed at the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, where the doors to the\u0026nbspProphet Muhammad’s final resting place were opened in a sign of respect for the visiting dignitaries.He then flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia’s port city on the Red Sea, and will later dine with the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman\u0026nbspat a state dinner, before travelling to Abu Dhabi.\u0026nbspMr Khan bemoaned Pakistan’s financial situation in his first formal address as prime minister in August, saying\u0026nbspthat “never in Pakistan’s history have we faced such difficult economic circumstances”.\u0026nbspThe country’s fiscal deficit ballooned to 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product in the financial year to 30 June.He announced a series of austerity measures and raised taxes for middle and higher earners, but warned he would “have to take more debt to repay our obligations” to international lenders.Last month, Pakistan\u0027s finance minister Asad Umar said an IMF rescue was a fallback option and that the government was exploring other avenues for assistance.

Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles. The military positions were set up in cooperation with Russia and Iran as mechanisms worked out during a series of talks that began in the Kazakh capital of Astana to monitor local truce deals.Fears for 3m people in rebel-held Idlib ahead of regime offensiveA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the oppositionA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition“These 12 observation points were equipped with limited military equipment and their main role was to monitor the agreement done in Astana,” said Nawar Oliver, a Syria specialist at the Omran Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in Istanbul. “At the moment when the regime started to mobilise its forces around Idlib, Turkey started to send reinforcements to some of these points.”Syrian forces aided by Russian air power could easily overrun the outposts. But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg","title":"un myanmar rohingya genocide united nations","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentInternational Criminal Court to investigate Myanmar’s Rohingya deportationsThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched a preliminary investigation into the Rohingya crisis to determine whether the mass deportations of Muslims from Myanmar into Bangladesh was a crime against humanity.Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspif the evidence collected in the initial probe was sufficient, it would pave the way for a full-blown investigation.Myanmar\u0027s military has been accused of a horrifying list of\u0026nbspviolations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya villages, leading about 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.Ms Bensouda said she will look at reports of “a number of alleged coercive acts having resulted in the forced displacement of the Rohingya people, including deprivation of fundamental rights, killing, sexual violence, enforced disappearance, destruction and looting”.Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalists who covered Rohingya killingsICC rules it can investigate crimes against RohingyaJournalists covering Rohingya crisis jailed for seven years in MyanmarAlthough Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is.

Only one percent of respondents believed God was female.When asked by ITV\u0026rsquos Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan why people are being told it is \u0026ldquooffensive to call God a man, Miss Widdecombe said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think it\u0026rsquos remotely offensive.

This noise, you couldnt avoid it.”Speaking at a pre-screening he described the experience of no one recognising him from his travel shows or Monty Python.“They didn’t know what a great star meant and basically to them I was a really old bloke and with their reverence for age the minder would rather delightfully would take my arm and say Are you feeling tired?In the second episode, there is a small sequence, and we were stuck in this airport and just to pass the time, our Director Neil, had brought along some footage of Monty Python and showed one minder the fish slapping dance.And her only comment at the end was, “Was that a live fish?”Palins journey begins by boarding a train from Beijing to Pyongyang - North Koreas capital.Not yet under the microscope of their full-time minders, the change in the landscape is remarkable.A shore dominated by Dandongs high-rises faces greenery and scattered buildings across the Yalu River on the North Korean side.Immediately, everything looks dferent, its as  weve stepped back inside, Palin says.His first taste of North Korean hospitality arrives in the form of a series of border guards, all intent on checking and rechecking his documentation.Palin makes it clear early on he is not going to allow an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship quash his famous sense of humour.I was asked - did I have a bible with me? I would normally say yes, absolutely, Im a good Christian man, but no, thats the wrong answer here.The second taste comes during a lunch taken on the 200-mile train journey comes with a side order of Korean propaganda as the television touts images of nuclear weapons.Off the train he meets his two guides - who turn out to actually number eight.He finds himself in a city missing many staples of the west - there are very few cars, and absolutely no adverts save for party propaganda.State controlled newspapers are covered with news of the historic meeting between north and south which were occurring at the time, and Plain says he sensed a eagerness for more openness among the populace.Palin points out how, until recently, the city would have been a soulless landscape of grey Soviet-style apartment blocks.In a simple and effective solution, Kim Jong-il commanded the whole lot was painted bright colours.Palin provides no shortage of humour titbits, including one point when he finds himself mystied watching the robotic movements of the traffic controllers - all of whom, he notes, are young women.Theres rumour that Kim Jong-un picks them himself, he says.He visits a local school and marvels at the childrens ping pong skills.Its like a factory farm for ping pong players, he says.Viewers can also look forward to the drunken antics of May Day - an annual day off for North Koreans.The celebrations allow a powerful insight into what Palin says are normal people, living in an unusual place."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dk-graphic-page14may.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg column theresa may brexit","story":"The Prime Minister will head to the continent on Thursday to visit Salzburg — like Bath, a world heritage city — to discuss her Brexit or Chequers proposals with other leaders of European governments.To date the EU has been officially dismissive of the main elements of Chequers, the complex customs arrangements and continued use of European Rules to secure access to the single market.Michel Barnier, who led the negotiations for the EU, has been clear that the EU cannot accept this position.The UK must either be in the Single Market with all that goes with it — including free movement — or it may have a free trade deal instead.In a sense, he is the keeper of the Orlamme for the EU.Historically, this was a sacred banner carried into battle for the kings of France when no prisoners were to be taken.The heads of government may be more conciliatory and keener to help a fellow leader, not least as most of them face their own domestic dficulties.It is also the usual form for the EU to make a deal.It protests that it is strictly a rules-based organisation to maximise its negotiating strength but then, like an honest costermonger, makes the necessary trade.At the same time the British Government seems desperate to agree something on almost any terms.Chequers rubbed out the Prime Minister’s red lines to leave the UK “half in, half out” subject to EU regulations in crucial areas of the economy, and to the European Court of Justice.The vassal has been put in chains.This desperation means it will be important to watch carefully what comes out of Salzburg.Any deal will be hailed initially as a triumph because of the hostile comments made not only by Mr Barnier but, in his recent state of the Union speech, by Jean-Claude Juncker.Overcoming these obstacles will be portrayed as a triumph for British diplomacy.Those who hope that Brexit will continue to mean Brexit will need to stay awake.The first item to watch out for is money. There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not.

I know what and who he is.Sesame Street has since been accused of double standards for saying the duo are just puppets... with no sexual orientation when, only three years ago, it confirmed Kermit and Miss Piggy were in a romantic relationship.Yoda actor Oz, 74, who has voiced the beloved yellow puppet since 1969, was responding directly to claims made by longtime script and songwriter Saltzman.Saltzman, who joined the iconic kids show in 1984, effectively outed Bert and Ernie in what proved to be a controversial interview with Queerty.He said he based them on his own relationship with film editor Arnold Glassman, ending a decades-long debate over whether the Muppets who shared a basement apartment on 123 Sesame Street, but slept in dferent beds, were lovers.Unfortunately for many, Oz poured cold water over the revelation last night.In his original post, the Hereford-born actor and puppeteer said: It seems Mark Saltzman was asked  Bert \u0026amp Ernie are gay.Its fine that he feels they are. Theyre not, of course. But why that question? Does it really matter?Why the need to define people as only gay? Theres much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness.Comic duo Bert and Ernie were jointly created by English-born actor Frank Oz and American puppeteer Jim Henson.Henson started by performing Bert and Oz voicing Ernie but after a few rehearsals, they switched roles.The famous pair were apparently the only characters to feature in the July 1969 pilot episode.They are also among a handful of characters to appear on The Muppet Show and the 1974 Muppet Valentine Show.Mark Saltzman, who suggested the characters were gay, began working on the show in New York in 1984.He said he wrote the characters based on his own same sex relationship with Arnold Glassman.But Jon Stone, another writer on the show, said they were based on the real le frienship between Oz and Henson.The idea behind the characters was to show that two people with wildly dferent personalities could still get on.Social media turned on Oz for shattering the hearts of millions so brutally and argued the characters have evolved beyond their original parameters into icons for gay young people.Reed Brice wrote: You may have created him, but you dont seem to realise what he meant to thousands of little boys growing up.You digging in your heels  with what seems like disgust is disappointing.Smith Knight added: Some kids who watched Sesame Street were gay. Like me. I loved Sesame Street and I was gay.But I wasnt allowed to see people who were like me on TV, and that SAID something to me.An anonymous user said: Woulda thought you coulda kept your a** out of this conversation, for the sake of both Ernie and Bert.Glassmans nephew Keith today told Sun Online he was very proud of Saltzman for lting the lid on Bert and Ernie.He added: Always have been [proud]. Two of the most wonderful people we have ever known.They were the original odd couple: Ernie the carefree goofball to Berts serious and easily-riled grouch.But amid all the squabbling and pranks, the pair shared touching moments of real affection and joy.Here are just a few...Bert and Ernie do ChristmasBert is in the bath when he gets a brilliant idea of what to get Ernie: A soap dish for his yellow rubber duck.Moments later, Ernie finds one of Berts beloved paperclips on the ground and decides hes going to get him a box to place them in.But Ernie has no money, so he trades his little ducky for a cigar box at Mr Hoopers pawn shop.Bert too is a little short of cash so he swaps what he brands the greatest paper clip collection in the Western world for the plate.The pair are touched to discover the sacrice the other made for them and in the end, Mr Hooper s their beloved items.50 shades of ErnieErnie decides to play a little game: He puts on a blindfold and has a little rummage around their apartment to see  he can guess what hes feeling.The first thing he reaches, of course, is Berts bouffant black hair.Its kind of soft and fluffy-like, Ernie starts. And its sticking straight up like a shaggy rug.With Bert getting more frustrated, Bert moves down to his bath sponge-like nose.Ernies hands move almost off camera  as he says: It feels sort of smooth and thin. Its floppy like a garden hose!The friendship testBerts reading a riveting book about oatmeal when Ernie comes straight out with it: Bert, do you like me?His pal replies: Of course I like you, youre my best friend.Ernies satisfied but he has another test for his housemate: He goes off camera and s with a rather garish hat on his head.Would you still like me  I wore fruit on my head? he asks, to which Berts answer is still yes.Ernie replaces Berts noseSomehow, Berts nose has fallen clean off his face and the monobrowed-Muppet needs help getting it back on.Of course Ernie cant resist the opportunity to have some fun at his mates expense and places it on his cheek.I dont think thats quite right, Bert says in his trademark nasally tone.Ernie gets Bert a puppyWhat relationship  is truly complete without a pet?Ernie saw to that in typically thoughtful fashion when he surprised his mate with an adorable dog.After some unsuccessful guessing at what the surprise could be, he reveals that hes brought home.Thankfully Ernie loves him and the video ends with them arguing over whether they should call him Norman or Godzilla the Wonder Dog.On the characters sexuality, Keith said: Enjoyed them as a child, never thought about their sexuality. Who cares.Saltzman told Queerty that he would tell people the duo were based on him and long-term partner Glassman, adding: I was Ernie.But he appeared to pull a U-turn last night, telling the New York Times his comments were misinterpreted.Saltzman said he and Glassman were like Bert and Ernie, opposites who found a way to love each other.He added: As a writer, you just bring what you know into your work. Somehow, in the uproar, that turned into Bert and Ernie being gay.The shows creators were very quick to reject claims they were a couple yesterday, describing them as best friends and puppets... who do not have a sexual orientation.Eagle-eyed fans accused them of hypocrisy because beloved frog Kermit and Miss Piggy had been in a relationship for years.They shared a statement from Kermits official Twitter account from 2015 in which he announced the puppets were terminating their romantic relationship.It added: Our personal lives are now distinct and separate and we will be seeing other people, pigs, frogs et al.Meanwhile LGBT activists have accused the show of being transphobic, saying a person doesnt need a penis to be a man, let alone love another man."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000319847955.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"starbucks customer hilarious cup after complaining to barista for misspelling his name","story":"Instead of taking down Marc, the confused cafe worker instead wrote out Cark - and was immediately ridiculed online.The photograph may have been around for a while but is once again doing the rounds on Twitter thanks to the account You Had One Job.Twitter jokers have had a field day with the snap with one writing: Do you think Cark is friends with Phteven?Another added: You have got to be kidding me!Others said they had experienced similar problems, with a woman called Marcy saying: I have stopped telling them my real name I either get Darcy, Tracy, Misty, Missy, once Marc.They literally did not even bother to put the Y at the end.But others pointed out it could just be a clever marketing ploy by Starbucks.One wrote on social media: I’m told they do it on purpose for free publicity.

The public has delivered its verdict, and as Prime Minister I will deliver on that. The UK will leave of 29th of March next year.”Her remarks came as:EU chiefs’ hopes of delaying or even reversing Brexit have been bolstered by Labour leaders such as London mayor Sadiq Khan giving their backing to a second referendum – dubbed a People’s Vote.Mr Tusk savaged the two most important parts of Chequers – a common rule book on goods and a new customs relationship - with a thinly veiled demand for more big concessions from the PM, and also over the Irish border.But he kept open a thin thread of hope for Mrs May by also praising some other elements of her softer Brexit blueprint.Declaring that the Brexit negotiations were entering “the decisive phase”, Mr Tusk said: “I’d like to stress that some of Prime Minister May’s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK’s approach as well as a will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit.By this I mean, among other things, the readiness to cooperate closely in the area of security and foreign policy.“On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.”The EU boss also issued another dire warning on how time was almost up, with just six months to go until Brexit day on March 29, saying: Today there’s perhaps more hope but there’s surely less and less time.“Therefore every day that is left we must use for talks.”WHY is the EU wasting time pressing for a border between Britain and Northern ­Ireland? It’s a non-starter.No Government could consider it. Especially not one entirely reliant on the votes of those most vehemently opposed to splitting up the UK, the DUP.This cannot be news to Brussels. They cannot believe Theresa May will surrender and collapse her Government.Why persist with it? The answer must be: to run down the clock — until, at the last minute, Mrs May agrees virtually anything to avoid a No Deal.Which is why Donald Tusk also still insists key areas of our wildly over-generous Chequers offer must be “reworked”.Mrs May has gone as far as she can. Two Cabinet figures have quit already. She must insist it’s take it or leave it.Only Britain has made genuine compromises in this negotiation, as despondent Brexiteers know only too well.It’s the EU’s turn.A deal must be cracked by the end of the Autumn, he added, and confirmed a final emergency summit would be held in mid November in the hope of sealing it.And EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also added to the pressure on Mrs May by saying that the UK and EU “are far away” from a deal still.The long-feared for rejection comes just 10 days before the Tories’ turbulent annual conference begins – plunging Mrs May into a fresh confrontation with her angry party.Hardline Brexiteer MPs and party members hate her Chequers blueprint, and even some of its supporters have insisted she must not concede any more ground to the EU.Hitting back at Mr Tusk, No10 insisted Mrs May would not budge a further inch until she hears concessions from the EU first.The PM’s official spokesman said: “What I heard from Donald Tusk is a welcoming of the evolution of the UK’s position and him setting out his plan for a special summit in November when he is hopeful a deal will be done.“What this shows you is the EU is now ready to sit down and start to have a proper discussion on a future partnership.”“The PM has evolved our position. It is now for the EU to evolve it’s position.Earlier the PM joined Ulster Unionists MPs to throw out a fresh bid by Michel Barnier to set up a new customs border down the Irish Sea.Issuing a new pledge to “improve” the EU’s offer to resolve the Irish border stand off, Brussels’ chief negotiator suggested clever technology could replace hard border post between Britain and Ulster.But on her arrival at a summit of EU leaders at Salzburg, the PM said she still cannot accept any separation of the province from the rest of the UK.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds also angrily shot down the Barnier plan, saying: “It still means a border down the Irish Sea”.But Mr Dodds also dubbed it “progress of sorts” that Brussels is now ready to look at technological solutions, having already dismissed it a solution for the Ireland’s North-South border as “magical thinking”.At the leaders’ dinner last night, Mrs May also warned them that there will be no Brexit deal unless their “unacceptable” Irish Sea border demands are dumped.British diplomats hoped for warmer words from EU leaders over Chequers, at least until after the Tory conference in Birmingham.Earlier yesterday, former Brexit Secretary David Davis warned the PM she would fail to keep Chequers on the table, as EU leaders will pile ever more demands for more concessions from.Instead, Mrs May will be forced to “reset” and “step back to what Donald Tusk offered in March” - a Canada-style free trade agreement, Mr Davis argued.Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: All these things will come back and well see more and more pressure, and she will have a deal she wont be able to bring back to the House of Commons because itll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands.“So shes going to have to have something else.The ex-Cabinet minister, who resigned in protest over the Chequers plan in July, also said he had repeatedly told Mrs May there would be a pressure point late in negotiations.Mr Davis added: It’s always the case with the European Union that they move at the last possible minute - after theyve tested your mettle, after theyve taken you to the clf edge, and thats what will happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man.

Making improvements in response to courier feedback is a top priority, such as the sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections we recently introduced.Our door is always open for inidual couriers to speak to us about any issues theyre having.A McDonalds spokeswoman directed the Sun Online to Uber for comment on the protests, but added nothing on delivery impact had been flagged specically to them through their customer services channels.Couriers went on strike in Scotland earlier this month in protest over the planned wage change.And in 2016 and 2017 drivers and couriers demonstrated against pay cuts."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000212881462.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"high speed hose treat prostate","story":"It shoots a saline solution guided by a robot into the prostate in minutes rather than the patient having to spend a night in hospital.Millions of older men commonly struggle with a condition known as benign prostate hypertrophy — causing problems with urinating.The prostate gland becomes enlarged and presses on the tube that takes urine from the bladder.The speedy new hose treatment could bring relief to many sufferers.Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said: “This procedure uses a specialised system for the targeted heat-free removal of prostate tissue with the patient under general or spinal anaesthesia.“A probe is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder where its position is confirmed using a computer.”It added: “The old procedure normally involved an overnight stay in hospital.”Clinical trials for the “hosepipe” are still on-going and more evidence will be available about the treatment next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are urging you to get yours serviced and to install audible carbon monoxide monitors in your home.It might just save a le.Schoolgirl Katie Overton went to bed excited about her little sister’s birthday party next day — but tragically the family never got to celebrate.The next morning, the 11-year-old was found dead in her bed, having been poisoned by carbon monoxide which had leaked from a faulty boiler at her home.Stepdad Paul recalls: “We’d been busy getting ready for Emma’s fth birthday party. We’d been baking cakes and blowing up balloons.“We went to bed as normal that night. In the morning we all got up and cracked on with the arrangements and we thought Katie was having a lie-in.“The house seemed very quiet. I popped out and when I came home, Katie still wasn’t up.“We were used to her having a lie-in at the weekend, but we felt something was wrong.”Mum Debra, 47, went up to Katie’s bedroom at the family’s rented terraced house in Southsea, Hants.Paul, 53, recalls: “Debs called out to me that she’d been sick in her bed. I ran upstairs and she was lying there, motionless.“I started shaking her, trying to rouse her. She wasn’t responding. Her body was cold.“I told Debs to call 999 and I spoke to paramedics on the phone. They told me to try mouth-to-mouth, but her jaw was locked. I knew then she was dead.“We had no idea why or what had happened. All of us were in a state of shock.”An ambulance rushed Katie to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, but within half an hour a doctor confirmed the family’s worst fears.Paul says: “He said there was nothing they could do for her. There was no obvious cause of death.“All we could think was that she’d been sick in her sleep and choked on it.“Because it was an unexplained death, we had CID come to the house. They asked us all sorts of questions, whether Katie had been having any problems at school.“They took away the mattress as evidence and the four of us were left in the house, with no idea the gas was still leaking.”To make matters even worse, rumours circulated around the area that Paul and Debra had murdered their daughter.Paul says: “A friend of Debra’s told us there were some lies going around. There was a lot of stares and whispering behind our backs.“It was incredibly hard to deal with, as we were grieving for Katie.“We were in a state of shock. She was a perfectly healthy girl and she seemed fine when she went to bed the night before.”Post-mortems do not routinely check for carbon monoxide poisoning, so no cause of death was given to her family.But around ten days later, Debra woke Paul early one morning complaining of a strong smell of fumes.He recalls: “I had a splitting headache and the house stank. I felt dizzy and sick.“I phoned our letting agent and said we thought something was seriously wrong with the boiler. An engineer came out and said he was going to put a carbon monoxide monitor by the boiler and we all had to leave the house. He left it running for ten minutes before going back in to grab it. He ran back out again and said, ‘I can’t believe any of you are alive.’“There was a lethal amount of carbon monoxide in the house. He kept saying he was surprised we were still alive.“I asked him  he thought it might have caused Katie’s death and he said, ‘Possibly’.” Paul phoned the police and even though Katie’s body had been cremated, they still had some blood samples. They later tested positive for carbon monoxide.An investigation revealed that faulty pipework on the boiler had been allowing the toxic gas to escape into Katie’s bedroom. Paul has been campaigning for tighter regulations to prevent deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning ever since Katie’s death in March 2003.She says: “He seemed very poorly. He didn’t have a temperature but he kept falling asleep and he’d vomit.“Then, I’d find him asleep in the dining room in a really strange position. Something just didn’t feel right.”The same morning, the carbon monoxide alarm at her home in Strood, Kent, started beeping. She says: “It wasn’t the continuous warning alarm but it was beeping as  it had run out of batteries.“I guess it just made me think and I had a niggling feeling it might be something to do with carbon monoxide. I rushed Aaden-James to A\u0026ampE. They took a blood sample and within five minutes he was on oxygen. He had to spend a couple of days in hospital.“Fortunately, he is OK and there are no lasting effects.”Tests later revealed the gas was leaking from pipes at the top of the boiler.Kirstein says: “If you don’t have a carbon monoxide alarm, get one now. I had one before, now I have three.”But latest figures show there are still around 50 fatalities a year in the UK.He says: “Fteen years on and the basic laws haven’t changed and people are still dying.“Katie’s death was preventable. We didn’t have a carbon monoxide alarm in the house.“We are all now living with a sadness that will never go away.”Paul adds that the tragedy has been particularly hard on Katie’s sisters, Sian, now 22, and Emma, 21.He says: “We want to make people aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide so no more families lose someone like we have.“Sometimes people will say to me, ‘It’s OK, I haven’t got gas, I’ve got a wood-burning stove.’“But carbon monoxide is produced by all solid fuels that burn. There are more carbon monoxide alarms around now than when Katie died, but in England, the law says they only have to be in properties that burn solid fuel.THE Sun is offering you the chance to win one of five brand new Ariston boilers worth more than £1,000 each.The Ariston Clas Net ONE comes with an industry-leading 12-year warranty.To be in with a chance of winning see thesun/aristoncompetition and answer two simple questions.“In Scotland, they have to be in all properties. The law in England needs changing — everyone should have one.“What about older properties? They often don’t have alarms. And what about your neighbour? We lived in a terraced house — the people next door may well have been poisoned as well.“Carbon monoxide goes straight through the brickwork. Please make sure you install an audible alarm in your home. If we’d had one, we would have been alerted to the gas and our beautul Katie would still be with us.”Paul also warns that gas safety ­certicates are not a substitute for ­having appliances regularly serviced.He says: “You can get a certicate without having a service. Of course, a lot of people choose this asSue, 45, had moved into a new-build home in Sale, Grt Manchester, with son Josh and now ex-husband Paul in 2003.She says: “I worked at home running a building firm. I’d get headaches and be queasy, dizzy and fatigued. I put it down to stress. I was forgetful, but thought I was getting dementia. Josh was six. He’d get stomach and head pains.Three years later, Sue was admitted to hospital TWICE with chest pain – and once collapsed – but each time doctors misdiagnosed cocaine abuse, let her rest then discharged her.“No one mentioned carbon monoxide and I wasn’t tested,” she says. But the warranty on her boiler then expired and Paul called an engineer, who found the leaky flue under the lounge floor.Sue still suffers memory, migraine and rheumatic trouble while Josh has poor concentration, and she thinks her family only survived because Paul would open windows a lot. She warns: “With smoke you get a warning but with CO there is no taste or smell. It is a silent killer.”“But what it means is that all these years after Katie’s death, an engineer can walk into a house, have a look at the flame and say, ‘Yes it’s burning a nice blue and it is safe.’“It gives you a false confidence. All gas appliances need to be serviced as per the manufacturers’ guidelines.“And get it done now, don’t wait until November when engineers are busy.

The electorate has clearly spoken.I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support.

Will it be discussed?Absolutely. To some extent the summit has morphed into a key Brexit staging post.There won\u0027t be any formal conclusions or formal changes to the position of the EU - this is an informal summit and the rigidity of EU processes mean they cannot suddenly change course.But there could be subtle indicators of positions being moulded.:: Any key moments to look out for?Yes - at the leaders dinner Theresa May had 10 minutes to state the UK position.It\u0027s the first time that the leaders have all met as one since Britain\u0027s Chequers proposal  was revealed back in July. She eyeballed her colleagues with a detailed explanation of what that means.She is understood to have told them that neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other and she told them that there would be no second referendum in the UK and no delay to the UK\u0027s departure. Towards the end of the summit the 27 remaining members of the EU will meet without Mrs May to discuss Brexit.After that President Tusk and Mrs May will have a 10 minute meeting.There she will hear, in private, what the 27 think, collectively, of her position. Immediately afterwards she will give a news conference.:: Are the two sides really worried about there being a \u0027no-deal\u0027 clf-edge withdrawal?Yes. President Tusk made that very clear in his letter to EU leaders: \"Unfortunately, a no deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.\"In my sideline chats, EU and UK diplomats are even more blunt. A \"no-deal\" by accident is unnecessarily possible - each blames the other\u0027s intransigence.At the main summit - the remaining 27 EU leaders will meet without Mrs May but with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss what they call the \"state of play\" of the negotiations.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"It prompted the resignation of then Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson, both of whom thought the proposal did not deliver the Brexit people voted for.And the EU side has consistently said Chequers isn\u0027t workable because it ides the integrity of the EU\u0027s single market by \"cherry picking\" the favourable parts of it.:: What\u0027s holding things up?There are two singular and distinct problems holding up the Brexit process.The first is part of the orce deal - the actual process of Brexit - and it\u0027s the \"Irish backstop\" problem.Britain has committed to leaving the single market and the customs union.By definition that means checks need to take place at hard borders between the UK and the EU unless or until some sort of mutual trade deal can be established. It is known as the \"backstop\" because it is a fallback position that the EU insists must be \"legally operable\" in case no better arrangement in the form of a trade deal  materialises.But it is a problem on the island of Ireland where no one wants to see the a  of hard borders between the north and the south.The EU\u0027s answer is for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs union. They say that checks can take place as goods pass between the British mainland and Northern Ireland and point out some agricultural checks already take place.The UK says that is not possible because putting Northern Ireland in a separate customs zone breaks up the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The second problem relates to the framework for the future relationship. This needs to be ironed out and put in a formal text - a political declaration - as part of the Brexit process.However the British Chequers proposal for the future relationship does not fly with the EU side.They think it represents a partial customs union on goods but no customs union on services and no freedom of movement.That, for Brussels, is cherry picking and undermines the integrity of the EU - other countries will want the same they fear and the whole single market/customs union project falls apart.It is quite easy to find compromise on the political declaration or to fudge it and deal with it later, post-Brexit day. It\u0027s much harder with the Irish backstop which is more binary and immediate.:: How\u0027s the relationship between the two sides?Not great. The British perception that the EU side isn\u0027t budging despite signicant compromises on their part is a source of huge frustration.The EU is angered by suggestions in the UK, by the Brexit secretary and prime minister no less, that they won\u0027t pay the \"exit bill\"   there is no deal.The EU was alarmed by Michael Gove\u0027s suggestion that whatever deal is done on the future framework, it can always be unravelled after Brexit day. ."},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

The PM\u0027s Chequers plan relies on mechanisms that are complex and untested and will take years to implement, according to the Lords EU Committee. While Mrs May insists it is the only credible plan on the table, the parliamentary committee said there were still signicant questions which needed to be resolved. In particular it pointed to concerns over the proposal for a facilitated customs arrangement  after Britain leaves the EU which lies at the heart of the plan. With only six months before the UK\u0027s scheduled exit from the EU, agreement on the principles underpinning any future customs arrangements has become a matter of urgency, the committee said.  The FCA is intended to enable trade between the UK and EU to continue on existing terms, while allowing Britain to pursue free trade deals around the world. It would establish a free trade area with a common rulebook for trade in goods, with no tarfs and no routine customs checks. For goods coming from outside the EU there would be a dual tarf system, with either the UK or the EU tarf being charged depending on their final destination. If this could not be firmly established, the UK authorities would charge the higher tarf and businesses would then claim back the dference on proof of final destination. HM Revenue and Customs has estimated it will add \u0026pound700 million a year to the costs of UK importers - still a fraction of the estimated \u0026pound18 billion a year cost of a no-deal Brexit. The committee warned however that the repayment mechanism was untested and would take several years to be developed and implemented.  It said the Government had yet to make clear how goods could be reliably tracked, potentially raising fears of an increased risk of fraud, while the EU has rejected the suggestion that the UK authorities could collect revenues on its behalf. At the same time, the committee said that the administrative burdens for firms enagaging with the repayment mechanism could reduce the attractiveness for other countries of striking free trade agreements with the UK. Baroness Verma, the chair of the EU external affairs sub-committee, said: The Government must, as a matter of urgency, provide answers to questions on the FAC. With only six months to go until Brexit the clock really is ticking on a mutually acceptable customs agreement.

EU chief Donald Tusk slapped down the Prime Minister’s blueprint as leaders arrived for a crunch showdown in Salzburg. But, over dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May indicated the UK would walk away  EU bosses fail to support her Chequers proposal by mid-November. She said: “We all recognise that time is short but delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option. “I know that for many of you Brexit is not something you want but it’s important to be clear that there will be no second referendum in the UK.  “The public has delivered its verdict and I as Prime Minister will deliver upon that. “The UK will leave on March 29 next year.” The PM also warned EU leaders not to split the UK as a solution to customs arrangements on Northern Ireland\u0027s border with the Republic, which forms the UK\u0027s only land frontier with the EU. She said: “The Commission\u0027s proposal for this protocol – that I should assent to a legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories - is not credible.” Brexiteers and Remainers have blasted her proposal, known as the Chequers plan because it was agreed at the PM’s country retreat. But, speaking over a slap-up meal of cream cheese with a tomato and courgette salad, followed by Viennese schnitzel with parsley potatoes, she insisted: “I believe I have put forward serious and workable proposals. “We will of course not agree on every detail but I hope that you will respond in kind. “The onus is now on all of us to get this deal done.” Earlier, EU Council President Donald Tusk dealt the latest hammer blow to the PM’s favoured withdrawal plan. Hours before her RAF jet even landed in the Austrian Alps, where the Sound of Music was set, he welcomed a “positive evolution” in Britain’s position, “as well as the will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit”. But he added: “On other issues, such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation, the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.” Revealing plans for an emergency EU Brexit summit in November, Mr Tusk warned: “Today there is perhaps more hope but there is surely less less and time.” EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker claimed the EU and Uk were “far away”.

The human smuggling gangs peddle their services like travel agents across social media, with 539 pages referred to Europol by British police last year. One page even offered discounts for children. The Prime Minister urged EU leaders to confront social media sites hosting the sick ads over dinner in Salzburg. She said tonight: “We must tackle the enabling environment – all those factors that make it far too easy for \u0026shycriminal networks to emerge and grow, putting migrants’ lives at such risk.”  The ads paint a picture of safe, comfortable travel to the EU. But, in reality, refugees and economic migrants clamber aboard ramshackle wooden and inflatable boats, packed tightly together for the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean from the North African coast. Most have no lejackets and last year an estimated 3,500 migrants drowned attempting the crossing. About 1,000 victims had perished by June this year trying to reach the EU. A senior UK official said of the social media posts: “They are appearing in a form that we would consider adverts and are clearly designed to make the idea of being smuggled into Europe an attractive and largely risk-free choice, which clearly it is not. “That is why we want these things removing as soon as possible.” While some other social media sites also hosted ads for trafficking, the official added: “In the majority of cases we are aware of it has involved Facebook.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new social rent homes slashed","story":"NewsNew social rent homes slashed by more than 200,000 since Tories came to powerEXCLUSIVE: In a keynote speech today, Theresa May boasted that tackling Britain’s housing crisis is her “personal mission” in a keynote speechShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew GregoryPolitical Editor20:07, 19 SEP 2018NewsIndependent housing experts said our findings exposed a “huge drop” in available social housing \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe number of new social rent homes has been slashed by more than 200,000 since the Tories came to power, new figures reveal. In a keynote speech today, Theresa May boasted that tackling Britain’s housing crisis is her “personal mission” in a keynote speech. The PM also claimed that her government has committed billions of pounds to getting more homes built. But shocking statistics buried in an official Government report reveal how the Tories have dramatically cut the amount of new cheaper housing rented out to poverty-stricken Brits. Independent housing experts said our findings exposed a “huge drop” in available social housing.  Labour Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said the figures proved the Tories have made the housing crisis “worse” not better. When the Tories came to power in 2010, there were 270,000 new homes a year rented out by councils or housing associations to Brits on lower incomes. The following year, in 2011/12, this was cut by 3,000. In 2012/13 the 2010/11 total new homes was slashed by 36,000. Every year since 2010 there have been further cuts to the number of social houses let, according to the report by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. By 2016/17, there were 70,000 fewer new social rent homes available compared to 2010. In total, there have been 213,501 fewer cheaper houses since the Tories came to power.

The idea is included in a 239-page report by the Initiative for Free Trade - a think tank backed by hard Brexiteers and launched by Boris Johnson in the Foreign Office map room. Spelling out an \u0027ideal\u0027 trade deal between the US and UK, the report says there should be zero restrictions on competition for government procurement. An executive summary of the report explains: Health services are an area where both sides would benefit from openness to foreign competition, although we recognize any changes to existing regulations will be extremely controversial. Perhaps, then, for other areas the initial focus should be on other fields such as education or legal services, where negotiators can test the waters and see what is possible.  That said, we would envisage a swt, time-tabled implementation of recognition across all areas within 5 years. It adds import restrictions that are based on unsubstantiated public health and safety concerns should be dropped - leading to fears chlorine-washed chicken could be imported.  Labour MP Peter Kyle, of the anti- Brexit People’s Vote campaign, said: “This is the real agenda of the Brexit elite, in black and white.  They want to use Brexit as an excuse to slash and burn the protections and standards we value so highly, and to chop up and sell off our NHS to the highest bidder. The report also recommends free movement of workers between the UK and the US,  they have a confirmed job to go to. The IFT was launched last year as the Institute for Free Trade, but dropped \u0027institute\u0027 from its name after a dispute with Companies House.

Mum-of-four Nikki O\u0027Neill, 46, from Bournemouth, says she became addicted to the low-fat snacks - which were previously \u0027free\u0027 to eat on the diet plan - as they satisfied her sweet tooth. She munches her way through six or eight yogurts daily, but says on a bad day she can consume three or four multipacks. Slimming World announced on Monday that Muller Lights now have to be counted as 1 \u0027Syn\u0027 each, within a member\u0027s daily allowance of between five and 15.  If Nikki continued to eat her way through multipacks, she would now far exceed her maximum Syn allowance before counting any other treats. A plain vanilla Muller Light contains 99 calories per pot, meaning 24 would add up to an intake of 2376 calories in yogurts alone. Despite her addiction, Nikki, who works in a school as a kitchen assistant, has managed to lose a huge amount of weight on the plan.  She told : I\u0027m devastated by the news.

I have a sweet tooth so I soon realised that this would be a great replacement for sugary snacks. Most people on Slimming World might have one or two low fat yogurts a day, but Nikki confesses she eats between six and eight Muller Lights daily. On a bad day I could easily get through three or four six-packs, she said. That adds up to between 18 and 24 yogurts in as many hours.  Nikki explained: I would usually have two for breakfast mixed in with oats, then a couple for lunch and dinner. The rest are in between meals - probably every half an hour when I am home in between my jobs. I have the fruit flavours in the morning and during the day. Then in the evening I love the orange or caramel ones with added chocolate bits. I\u0027m gutted, though, as they have just brought out banoffee flavour and I would have lived off these!  Nikki estimates she spends upwards of \u0026pound30 per week on the light desserts - and she panics  she doesn\u0027t have any in the fridge. Every night, pretty much, my husband will ask  we need anything from the shops and yogurts are always on the list, she said. The school worker is mum to Luke, nine, Holly, 10, Jack, 13 and 28-year-old Liam and says she is renowned for her addiction among her friends and family - who think it\u0027s hilarious. I was gutted when I heard they were to have Syns but I also found it so funny that friends and family tagged me in posts about it, she said.  I genuinely worry what I will have as my go-to sweet snack now. It\u0027s going to be a really hard habit to break, that\u0027s for sure. I will have to savour each one instead of having four or five in a row! When asked  she\u0027s tempted to carry on eating the yogurts excessively, given how much weight she\u0027s lost, Nikki had a logical answer. To be honest,  I cut down to, say, six a day, that will probably make a big dference to my weight loss. A Slimming World spokesperson said: “We routinely review our guidance for all food products to ensure it includes the most up to date information and advice, and incorporates feedback from our members and Consultants.

Researchers say they have now narrowed a decades-long search for the Endeavour to one or two archaeological sites. The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project  however have warned they are yet to “definitively” confirm whether the wreck has been located. The director of the Australian National Maritime Museum, Kevin Sumption, described their findings as promising. He said ers in the US were currently working to confirm whether one of five shipwrecks is the Endeavour by gathering samples from the location. “It’s not definitive that this is Endeavour,” he said. “We’re carefully gathering very specic samples of timber and we’re going to conduct forensic analysis to see what we have. Most of the ships that were scuttled in Newport in August 1778 were built of American or Indian timbers [but] the Endeavour was built in the north of England of predominantly oak.  “With some good detective work we can sample the timbers of this promising site [and] then we might have evidence that this ship is at least British in origin.” The discovery has stirred hope that the remains could be excavated in time for the planned celebrations in 2020 of the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook’s arrival in Australia. More details of the ship are set to be released on Friday with researchers saying they will provide a three-dimensional image of the site located off tiny Goat Island in Narragansett Bay in Newport. The scientists have cautioned that time has taken a considerable toll on the remains. The ship, one of the most famous in naval history, was used by Captain Cook on his first voyage of discovery to Australia from 1769 to 1771.

Radley, thought to be a border terrier cross, was found by a member of the public in the early hours of Monday morning in west London. The stressed and frightened pup was discovered with an elasticated hairband tied around his legs which was cutting off his circulation and damaging his paws. There was also an unopened tin of dog food in the handbag, which had a note stuck on the outside that said: Found this puppy.  Radley is said to be in fairly good body condition but has had diarrhoea so he is being closely monitored. The RSPCA\u0027s Inspector Phil Norman is now investigating how the pooch came to be dumped in the handbag. He said: We received a call from a woman who’d found a little puppy in a red handbag fastened to the door handle of a charity shop in The Broadway, Greenford. “It was around 2am on Monday morning. “Poor little Radley must have been very stressed and frightened being stuffed into that handbag and abandoned in the middle of the night.  The pup was taken to the RSPCA\u0027s Putney Animal Hospital, in south-west London. Inspector Norman has spoken to the local shops and is gathering CCTV in order to trace whoever is responsible for abandoning the pup. He’s also seeking any witnesses who may have seen anything suspicious in the area at the time or who recognise Radley to get in touch by calling the charity’s appeal line on 0300 123 8018.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study found one fth of consumers wrongly believe frozen fruits and vegetables contain fewer nutrients than their fresh counterparts. Another one in 12 mistakenly think frozen food doesn’t last as long as a fresh product while another one in ten reckon frozen food is more expensive. And two fths are of the opinion frozen foods are filled with preservatives to give them a longer shelf-le. Others myths surrounding frozen meals are that you can\u0027t safely cook them from frozen, with four in 10 believing you aren’t supposed to heat food from frozen.  Following a study of 2,000 adults by Birds Eye, dietitian and health writer, Laura Tilt said: “Many, but not all, foods can be cooked from frozen. \u0027\u0027Examples include chicken breasts, mince, pizza, fruit and vegetables, fish and ready meals. “The best advice is to check the packet of the food for specic cooking and heating instructions.” The study also found nearly two thirds don’t think that all types of food can be frozen, but experts revealed the opposite is true. The truth is that only a few foods aren’t ideal for freezing, such as eggs, both raw and cooked, or vegetables with a high water content as they tend to go mushy upon defrosting. Around one in four believe you can refreeze food once it\u0027s thawed without cooking it first, which is also false because you can refreeze it but must cook between thawing and refreezing.  Furthermore, 12 per cent weren\u0027t aware frozen food can be part of a health diet. Others - 38 per cent - believe you can’t keep frozen food past it’s expiry date when in fact you can, although its quality will deteriorate. Finally 41 per cent believe it\u0027s dangerous to defrost certain types of food on the counter, when in reality but it should, ideally, be defrosted in the fridge to prevent it entering the danger zone of five to 63 degrees. The study also found that, as a nation, we get through 300 million frozen food items a week, from frozen fruit and veg to frozen fish. And six in 10 said there are certain foods they would prefer to buy frozen, including peas, fish fingers and fish fillets. It also emerged peas come out on top as the most regularly consumed frozen food, ahead of chips and even ice cream.

Emma, 38, says she wants her son to enjoy days of \u0027fun and freedom\u0027 and \u0027playing in the wild\u0027, Hull Live reports . Stanley is a June baby and so is one of the youngest in the school year. He does not have any additional needs, but his parents believe it is in his best interests to start school next year, once he is five and at compulsory school age .  In her blog, Dirt, Diggers and Dinosaurs , his mum explains her reasons for holding him back by applying to defer his admission to school for a year. She starts by saying: We’ve done something that many of our friends and family will view as controversial. We have decided not to send Stanley to school this year. Instead, he will be starting next September when he is five. For the extra year he will be attending preschool part time, playing, bonding with his brothers, playing, exploring, enjoying days out, playing, growing and developing at his own pace. She then answers some of the questions she says she\u0027s been asked.  No, Stanley does not have any special educational needs. No, we haven’t ‘held him back’ because he was struggling at preschool. No, it’s not that we can’t bear to let him go, and I want to keep him a baby. No, we aren’t doing it for ourselves and not thinking about what’s best for him. No, we’ve not thrown our dummy out because he didn’t a place at our first choice of school this year... he did. No, we’ve not done what’s easiest for us.   As you can probably tell from the answers above, I’ve had a bit of an ear bashing by some which I hope is mostly fuelled by misinformation and misunderstanding, she says. Explaining her decision, she said: The plain fact is, he’s four. We’ve simply chosen not to send him to school early, we are sending him at school age which  you go back a generation was the absolute norm. I personally believe that in the UK all children start school too early and that we’d be better off following our European neighbours whose children start school at aged seven when they are emotionally and physically ready.  We were recently informed at a preschool parents evening that Stanley  would soon cope with starting school, as he’s really bright. This really hit home for me, a four year old shouldn’t have to cope with anything. Emma, from Hull, Yorkshire, who is expecting another baby, says she decided to write the blog to let other parents know it is possible to prevent your child from starting school at the age of four, as she believes it\u0027s not widely known. This year three set of parents have successfully applied to Hull City Council to defer their child\u0027s entry to school. Emma said: I’ve had two relative strangers - who I only know through ious kids clubs - tell me that they think it’s amazing, and one who asked me to email her the info so she could then look into it for her daughter. She had no idea that the option was available, which I think is a massive issue. Thanks to a change in DfE legislation, we not only have the choice whether to start his school journey prior to CSA or at CSA but also have the right to request admission into Reception class at CSA rather than Year One, ensuring that he will not lose a vital whole year of early education. I think an extra year of being a child with no responsibility or pressure can only be a good thing. When I read articles about phonics tests in Year one ages five and six and SATS at ages six and seven it makes me so sad. When did being a child become so target driven? Aren’t we told by midwives and health visitors that ‘they all learn at their own pace?\u0027 Why does this suddenly change when they enter the school system? The extra year at home will be an extra year of developing emotionally and at his own pace. An extra year of learning through play, exploration and love.  A controversial decision which is a big \u0027gamble\u0027 Emma said she 100 per cent believes she has made the right decision for Stanley, but admits there is a big gamble involved. She said: The BIG gamble in all of this and the only thing that regularly niggles at me is whether we will get offered our first choice school again in the next round of admissions. If we don’t, then will our offered school be happy to support a CSA Reception start, or will they be championing Year 1? The LEA and school would have to provide evidence that missing a whole year of education would be in his best interests. I guess we’ll just have to face any obstacles, and fight the battles as we get to them. However Emma signs the blog post off by saying as she sits there writing the post and watching Stanley performing a puppet show for his brother using three toy dinosaurs, she knows with all certainty that this is the best thing for her child.

Jurors were shown footage of Mohammed Abdul, 21, allegedly driving his Suzuki Vitara past bouncers and into revellers. CCTV footage appears to show the vehicle coursing down an alleyway packed with clubbers before later ploughing into the venue itself. From a camera inside Blake\u0027s in Gravesend, Kent, the vehicle\u0027s front lights can be seen getting closer and closer as dancers mingle, unaware the Suzuki is hurtling towards them.  One man can then be seen spread-eagled on the bonnet, swept off his feet as the Suzuki rams into him from behind. Others are seen fleeing to safety as security guards appear in hot pursuit of the car, shortly before midnight on March 17 this year. The car can be seen reversing, its registration plate hanging off at an angle, as patrons stagger to get to their feet. Some clubbers can be seen appearing to swarm the vehicle and showering it with a volley of thumps, while others look visibly distressed in the corner of the nightclub.  Abdul is on trial at Maidstone Crown Court for attempted murder over the incident which left eight people injured. The court heard he had been ejected from the venue at around 11.40pm for being too drunk. His trial was told that while in a rage and acting aggressively, he threatened bouncers, telling doorman Peter Muro: If I can\u0027t come in I\u0027m going to come back and shut this place down and kill you guys. Abdul ed in his vehicle around 10 minutes later and drove at speed down a narrow alleyway by the side of the club, with door staff and clubbers jumping or being pulled out of the way, prosecutor Simon Taylor said.  The alleyway housed a marquee attached to the club with a dance floor and DJ booth, and it was filled with revellers there to see grime rapper Giggs. Abdul, of Deptford, south-east London, accepts he was the driver of the vehicle and has admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, jurors heard. But he denies two counts of attempting to murder persons in the vicinity of the club and an alternative charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

The map - the UK’s largest database of publicly-accessible toilets - includes lavs that are located in local businesses as well as those at bus and train stations, shopping centres, libraries, leisure centres and hotels.  And it’s compiled using information from councils, the businesses themselves and YOU! As well as using the map to discover nearby loos, the public can help improve the service by adding new locations or flagging loos that have closed. Anyone can go on the website and add or edit the correct information about the toilet such as who can access it, opening hours, or facilities available. Just click on the Great British Toilet Map image below to reveal the map and find your nearest available toilet...   By visiting toiletmap.org.uk on a computer of smartphone, your device will automatically find your location and reveal your nearest available toilets. Users can also look for loos before leaving their home or office by typing in a postcode to search other areas.  As well as pinpointing the exact location of nearby public toilets, helpful information is featured about each one including whether there’s a charge and  it has an attendant. There is also a tool which lets users set preferences to highlight any specic needs they might have, such as whether it has disabled access and baby changing facilities, and what the opening hours are.

Roscommon native Eamon Donoghue was on the plane.  He said: I was on this flight. It was a heart in mouth moment, but they got us down second time of asking. The plane coming in behind us did likewise albeit it wasn’t down as low. In absolute awe of the pilots.

Lindsey Coubray, aged 19, suffers from aquagenic urticaria, which affects just one in 230 million people worldwide. She breaks out in severely itchy hives whenever she comes into contact with water - stopping her from showering or swimming. Lindsey suffers excruciating pain  she is caught out in a rain shower and the reaction is even triggered by her own sweat and tears. The office worker said: “People often wonder how I can be allergic to something that makes up 70 per cent of my body.  “There is often a sense of disbelief, followed by questioning how this is even possible. “Whenever I have a shower, as well as sneezing, I am covered from head to toe in an itchy rash which looks and feels like a nettle rash, my nose burns and my eyes become bloodshot and swollen. “Warm weather is a particular challenge because I get hot, sweat and then end up with an intensely itchy rash all over my back, arms, head and chest. “If I get caught out in the rain, my skin gets very itchy and feels like it’s burning.” Lindsey, who had always sneezed while washing herself, was diagnosed two years ago after her symptoms worsened.  She has to take strong antihistamines and asthma medication before taking a shower. She also relies on drinking milk because water leaves her feeling nauseous and creates mouth sores. Lindsey, of Wheathamsted, Herts., is so senstive that even humidity can leave her struggling to breathe. She said: “Sometimes,  it has just stopped raining and I go outside, I can find myself feeling breathless.”  Lindsey is hoping to raise awareness of the condition and has set up an Instagram account ‘aquagenic.urticaria’ to try and help other sufferers.

When there are more than one million people on council house waiting lists and tenants are struggling to pay sky-high rents, a few words of synthetic compassion and a woolly promise of extra money won’t cut it. The Prime Minister dangled the offer of an extra \u0026pound2billion for housing associations but this will not be available until 2022 and will be spread over six years. Even  this cash does materialise it will hardly compensate for \u0026pound25billion cut from the housing budget since 2010.  Nor was there any acknowledgement from Mrs May that her government had raised council house rents, overseen a rise in homelessness and broken its promise to build a like-for-like replacement for every council house sold under right to buy. She then had the gall to claim the Tories were the champions of social housing.  To build the homes needed requires real ambition, not platitudes and piece-  meal funding.  Bitter taste Last week it was Amazon, this week it is Starbucks. These US giants make millions of pounds in profit in this country but drag their feet when it comes to paying their fair share of taxes. Starbucks will tell you its use of clever and complicated accounting methods is all above board. However there is a big dference between what is legally right and what is morally right.  While these firms employ expensive accountants to minimise tax bills it is left to the rest to plug the hole in the Treasury coffers.

His parents, Victoria, 40 and Greg, 34 have been nothing but supportive towards their son after he announced that he wanted to perform in drag. The 11-year-old\u0027s mum has been told by other aspiring drag queens or gay men who say that they wish they could have \u0027come out\u0027 in their younger le. She said: Jason tends to be a little shy but then it\u0027s like flipping a switch to Suzan Bee, he has more confidence and is very sassy. Seeing the change in him and how happy he is, makes my heart burst with happiness.  It\u0027s so exciting seeing him perform, he can get up there and do what he does. It makes us feel happy as a family watching him strut his stuff. I just want my kids to be happy and do what makes them feel complete, I feel that drag does that for Jason. I couldn\u0027t care less about what people think of me, I know some people are closed minded to gay and drag culture, but generally, people are supportive. Two years ago, a lady came up to me and said, \u0027your daughter is so pretty,\u0027 when I told her he was my son she said, \u0027oh my god, that\u0027s even better.\u0027 Jason is not the son I expected to have, I expected him to like trucks and getting dirty working on cars, but my son basically strutted out the womb. To me, he is perfect the way he is. The mum-of-three added: Seeing him out there and like, \u0027This is me, this is who I am\u0027 is fantastic and makes me so proud.  Young gay people and drag queens come up to us and say they wish they could have \u0027came out\u0027 in their younger le like Jason. Victoria, who works as a preschool teacher, said that Jason has had a fascination with dressing up in girl\u0027s clothes and make-up since he was just three. Since starting drag Suzan Bee, who has a wardrobe full of sequinned outfits, has performed for projects to raise funds for the Aids Foundation and at multiple Pride events from Oklahoma City to Montreal. The encouragement showed by his family led Jason to officially \u0027come out\u0027 last year. Victoria said: I\u0027m so glad he could talk to us, it was like a regular conversation. He came in and told us he had a crush on someone at school, he told us his name and that he made him happy.

One modern advancement, is the video doorbell , which allows people to see who is approaching their front door, from the safety of their own home.  Gone are the days of opening up to cold callers, you can now screen who you do and don\u0027t answer the door to.

May shared his amusing story of the tech fail on Twitter.  A Javascript developer, the dad is no stranger to coding and played around with some of the features of his Nest doorbell app to suit his needs. He programmed the device to automatically lock the door  the camera detected an unfamiliar face. But he soon found there was a major flaw in his plan.     On Tuesday the father attempted to get inside the house after checking on his son who was playing in front of the house.  However the doorbell locked the door and wouldn\u0027t let him in. So he decided to check the app and see what the problem was - but he wasn\u0027t prepared for what he saw.

Laura Weiser, 28, purchased a Disney princess face mask from Primark last week, planning a relaxation session. On Saturday, after an exhausting day redecorating the front room of her house with husband Alan, Laura decided to have a soak in the bath before heading to bed, wearing the \u0026pound3 Princess Jasmine face mask. But when her husband clapped eyes on her he burst out laughing, prompting her to clamber out of bed and take a selfie to see what all the fuss was about. Laura, a full-time mum, was shocked when she realised she looked less Disney princess and more like Leatherface from 1974 horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Laura, from Oxford, said: It looks beautul before you put it on, but when it\u0027s on it\u0027s a really scary-looking face - it\u0027s absolutely terrying. I knew as soon as my husband saw me that something was up, he was just sat next to me in bed in stitches. That\u0027s never a good sign. I remember thinking to myself \u0027it can\u0027t be that bad\u0027 so I got up and took a picture. But yes, it really was. It\u0027s quite an unusual look with big eyes printed on it, I\u0027ve never had a sheet mask where the eyes are covered up before, I guess it\u0027s to give you the full effect. It reminded me of the character Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Self-professed Disney fan Laura who lives with Alan and their four children Bonnie, 10, Nigel, 8, Dennis, 5, and Lincolnr, 2, snapped up the cucumber sheet face mask from the Oxford branch of the chain a fortnight ago. When the mum-of-four opened the packaging to the \u0027A Whole New World\u0027 face mask she was thrilled to see the outline of Princess Jasmine\u0027s face sporting her signature cat-eye make-up, scarlet lips and gold earrings. However when the mask went on it distorted the hugely popular character\u0027s features leaving friends and family in stitches at her bizarre look. Pals posting on social media compared her to the murderous Leatherface - who wears masks made of his victims\u0027 skin. Laura said: My daughter Bonnie found it hilarious but I took it off after 15 minutes as I was worried about the younger kids walking in and seeing me,  they had they would have probably cried. It looked atrocious, it was the most bizarre thing ever, but a really good novelty. Alan looked over at me and burst out laughing. The mouth didn\u0027t line up, so it looked like I had two mouths and it was just really scary, but also funny.  I sent a picture to my mother-in-law and sister-in-law and they sent messages back with lots of laughing emojis. Laura said that although the face mask was the cause of a few laughs, she couldn\u0027t fault the quality of the product which left her skin feeling refreshed. Laura said: Despite looking so terrying, the product itself was amazing, I had lovely skin afterwards and my face was very moisturised.

She now admits she was wrong and says she wishes she could wind back the clock. Ahead of the child\u0027s birth, Natalia had sent Inna a payment of 3,000 roubles - just \u0026pound34. Natalia, a 43-year-old teacher, is said to have empty nest syndrome now her after her adult son left home, and wanted one last baby. She already bringing up another adopted daughter. Now both women have been formally detained as a criminal probe is launched under Russia’s child trafficking laws. They could each face up to ten years in jail.  Investigators say that Natalia posted an online advertisement saying: “Hi everyone! My husband and I would very much like to get a baby aged 0 to 3 months. All the documents for adoption are ready. Please send a private message for details. Girls, darlings, please help.” Inna - at the time pregnant after a short relationship with a man she met at a local cafe - replied: “Hello, I would like my daughter to be adopted. Please do so, I am not able to raise her, no chance”. She told police she lived with her mother and sister in a cramped apartment and they were furious when she became pregnant. They were adamant she should not keep the baby. Omsk prosecutor Vasily Gumenyuk said: “During our interrogation, the biological mother of the baby explained that she lived in a rented apartment with her mother and sister. “Both were strongly against the baby and put strong psychological pressure on the future mother.  “The young woman failed to get a job, and she was not married to the father of her baby. “He knew about her pregnancy but did not plan to support her. “She decided to give away the baby to the teacher from St Petersburg.” The baby deal would have remained secret but for Inna and her mother telling their landlady - who immediately informed police. Officers knocked on Natalie’s door in St Petersburg one week after the airport exchange. Inna said: “All the way through my pregnancy, my mother and sister were attacking me. “They wanted me to have an abortion. “My mother threatened me, saying ‘If you give birth, just don’t come back home, I won’t let you in!’” She said: “They told me a baby is not a toy.” “I posted in my social network that I needed help and Natalia Zhdanova replied.” She admitted she could have given the child up at her maternity hospital but chose not to and instead to hand the baby to Natalia who she had not previously met.  She was paid 3,000 roubles - sent in advance allegedly to cover the cost of nappies - but claimed Natalia also promised to help her and her family find jobs in St Petersburg. Asked about the moment she handed over the child, she said: “Of course it was hard. “I was in hysterics in the airport when it happened. “But Natalia’s  flight has already been announced, I had to give her my daughter so  could catch their plane. “My daughter was nine days old. I would have given her away earlier but we stayed in the hospital for a week, and then we lived at home for several days, but it was just impossible to be there because of constant scandals.” She said: “When the story became known, a friend of my mother said that she would have helped us.

Cyril Moreau and Dominique Jacovides, of the Bestimage agency in Paris, were accused of snapping Catherine Middleton and her husband, Prince William, on a private holiday in the South of France.  The lensmen have always insisted they are innocent – pointing to a complete lack of evidence in a case that saw the Royal couple win \u0026pound92,000 in compensation .  This is far more than is usually awarded in such privacy cases in France, leading to an appeal by French Closer Magazine, which published the snaps in 2012.  Moreau and Jacovides appealed sentences handed down in September 2017, but on Wednesday the Versailles Appeal Court, west of Paris, uphold them all. Prosecutor Marc Brisset-Foucault told the court: ‘There was an absolutely unacceptable breach, not only of the privacy and the private lives of these two iniduals, but also of the dignity of a woman.’ Long-lens cameras caught Kate solely wearing a pair of bikini bottoms, with William at one stage rubbing sun cream into his we’s skin.  At the time, the couple were relaxing at a Provence chateau owned by the Earl of Snowdon, the late Princess Margaret’s son.  The editor of Closer magazine , Laurence Piea, 52, and Ernest Mauria, the 72-year-old director of the Mondadori group which publishes it, were fined \u0026pound42,000 each.  The photographers were also fined the equivalent of up to \u0026pound8,500 each, after Prince William presented statements attacking the paparazzi.

Heart-warming footage has emerged of an elephant displaying \u0027human-like traits\u0027 while making sure her sleeping baby is still alive and well. The mum first extends her trunk tenderly over her son\u0027s chest before moving to check to see  he is breathing through its trunk. Elephants are known to show signs of emotions such as anger, joy and grief and are among of the most intelligent animals on the earth. This delicate moment between mother and son were filmed in Thailand. The species is under threat across the world, largely due to poaching for ivory. Large numbers of elephants were lost during the 20th century as they were killed for their tusks and as humans competed for resources.  Climate change is also playing a part in destroying the chances for elephant survival, as their environment will become drier and hotter. Leslie A. Temanson, a former programme director at Volunteer in Thailand with Friends for Asia, filmed the clip. He said, Moms are moms, no matter the species. This mother elephant showed me as she tenderly checked her sleeping calf, much as a human mom might do her napping baby.

Civilians described gang rapes on an industrial scale, toddlers being swung against tree trunks until they were dead and families barricaded in their homes to be burned alive. When a mother fled from one inferno carrying a small baby she was shot and the child crushed to death by a soldier, an eye-witness said. The testimony was gathered from 100 people who survived an offensive in Unity State, in the northern Greater Upper Nile region of the country, between April and July this year. Government troops are accused of giving free rein to youth militias, unleashing a wave of systematic slaughter. The epicentre of the violence was Mayendit and Leer counties, areas held by the opposition.  Witnesses described civilians being slaughtered in their villages. Some were burned alive in their tukuls - traditional mud huts which often have a thatched roof. A man believed to be over 90 had his throat slit. Nyaweke, a 20-year-old woman, said she saw soldiers shoot dead her father and kill a number of children in Thonyoor, in Leer There were seven men [soldiers] who collected the children and put them into a tukul and they set the tukul on fire. I could hear the screaming. They were four boys. One boy tried to come out and the soldiers closed the door on him. There were also five boys whom they hit against the tree, swinging them. They were two [or] three years old. They don’t want especially boys to live because they know they will grow up to become soldiers. In a separate incident in Rukway village, also in Leer, a couple and their two grandsons were burned alive in a house. Their daughter attempted to flee with her baby but she was shot and her child stamped to death. Even those who fled their villages had little chance of survival. Soldiers used amphibious vehicles to hunt those who had fled into swamps.  Nyalony, an elderly woman, told Amnesty she witnessed soldiers killing her husband and two other men: When the attack started, early in the morning while we were sleeping, my husband and I ran to the swamp together. Later in the morning, after the fighting was over, the soldiers came into the swamp looking for people, and sprayed the area where we were hiding with bullets. My husband was hit he cried out in pain. He was still alive, though, and the soldiers caught him, and then they shot him again and killed him. He was unarmed and wasn’t a fighter just a farmer.” Survivors faced unspeakable horror. Women and young girls said that they were abducted before being gang raped, sometimes for many weeks. Others were used as slaves to cook and clean for their captors. A 60-year-old man found his niece after she had been sexually assaulted by five men. She was just 13. My brother’s daughter was raped and she was going to die, he said. When they raped her, we came and found her and she was crying and bleeding … she couldn’t hide … she told me she was raped by five men. We could not carry her and she could not walk. There were also reports of sexual mutilation and castration.  Nyatap, who is around 32, gave a graphic account of her ordeal. Eight months pregnant, she was abducted with her five-year-old son and daughter, seven. There were 20 soldiers, she said. The other women who are not pregnant were raped. There was another lady... she was three months\u0027 pregnant and she miscarried. She was raped by 10 men. I saw it happen. They were just raping her under another tree. They put us in one compound.... there were other ladies... They would take turns raping them. Soldiers accused of carrying out the slaughter are also said to have looted and burned on a vast scale, making it virtually impossible for survivors who had fled to  to their homes. Amnesty claims that the situation was enabled by South Sudan\u0027s government failing to prosecute suspected war criminals for previous massacres in 2016. Four people had been identied but no action had been taken. Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East Africa, said: “A key factor in this brutal offensive was the failure to bring to justice those responsible for previous waves of violence targeting civilians in the region. “Leer and Mayendit counties have been hard hit in the past, and yet the South Sudanese government continues to give suspected perpetrators free rein to commit fresh atrocities. The result has been catastrophic for civilians.” Amnesty has called for immediate end to all human rights abuses. Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser, said: “It’s impossible to ignore the cruel reality –  the South Sudanese authorities had acted on our warnings back in 2016, this latest wave of violence against civilians in Leer and Mayendit might have been avoided. The only way to break this vicious cycle of violence is to end the impunity enjoyed by South Sudanese fighters on all sides. The government must ensure that civilians are protected and that those responsible for such heinous crimes are held to account.

Funds from the event will go to children’s charity Help for Kids.Today, Claire Hutchison speaks to another one of the couples taking part.All eyes will soon be on an engaged Dundee couple, as they take centre stage in Strictly Come Prancing.Iain McLeod, 32, and Jemma Ward, 29, from St Mary’s, decided to put their names forward for the event to support Help For Kids.Jemma is an early educator of families and also works with children who have additional support needs.The charity is something which is close to both of their hearts.Bus driver Iain said: “We’ve got two kids, so we know the importance of helping children, especially as Christmas approaches.”Jemma added: “Kids in Dundee get a lot of assistance from Help For Kids – especially through the ADHD support group.“A lot of families are having a hard time in the city, through no fault of their own, and it’s nice knowing there is a good cause to help them.”It is going to be a particularly special day for the family, as Jemma’s mother, Jackie, is celebrating her birthday on the night of the event.Jemma said: “She’s getting a ticket and she’s looking forward to us messing up a bit.”The couple are taking part for a bit of fun and don’t expect to win.Iain said: “I’m absolutely quaking it. I didn’t realise the magnitude of it.“I think I’ll be OK but it’s a new challenge – the rehearsal was quite overwhelming.”Jemma has previous experience of dancing from her school days and says it doesn’t come naturally to Iain.She added: “He’s not really good at dancing at all.“He’s got no rhythm and two left feet but he’s a character who is up for a laugh.”Iain describes them both as relaxed people and said they are going to have a bit of fun. He said, despite her dancing past, Jemma is quite nervous about taking part.Iain added: “She finds it quite daunting but she will take it in her stride.”The couple agreed that the main thing they will take from the challenge is supporting a good cause.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"

It has been handed in to the council.A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBTI forum, which is organising the rally, said Mr Morrison was entitled to his opinions,\"I have no problem with him or the people who have signed the petition holding their views and I totally respect that but there are a lot of other people who don\u0026rsquot hold those views,\" she said.\"You will always get people who don\u0026rsquot like LGBT stuff.\"Referring to his comments about people frolicking on rainbow-coloured floats, she said: \"Basically this is a celebration and  he doesn\u0026rsquot like people dancing and enjoying themselves, I could see that would be a problem for him.\"She said there was nothing illegal about the proposed parade.\"Obviously, nothing untoward will be happening during the march,\" she said. \"It will be totally family-friendly.\"He has a moral objection which is his personal objection and he is perfectly entitled to that.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Thursday 20 Sep 2018

march","story":"\u0026nbspA GAY pride march in Inverness could get the green light as early as this week.The planned Proud Ness parade, which is expected to take place in Inverness on October 6, has been overshadowed by a row between religious objectors and counter petitions.The row erupted last week, shortly after Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , submitted a petition of around 600 to 700 names opposing what he deemed the \"unsavoury event\".The move sparked a furious response from other sections of the community, with three separate petitions launched supporting the Gay Pride march. They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

And he came on against Belgium.“All those little bits of experience being away with the Scotland squad can only help in the future for Graeme.“For me he has taken a big step forward from the games in the close season when they went to Peru and Mexico.“What he’s done now is let the manager know his abilities.“If Graeme keeps up his level of performance for us I am hopeful, and I am sure, he will be involved in future Scotland squads.“We are hoping he can be at the heart of that over the next period of time.“Sometimes you have to wait for starts but I have no doubt he is good enough to go on and do that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5ba0973c62722-705x564.jpg ","title":"daily lives explored as aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year long portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of portraits of north-east residents have formed part of a year-long photography project.Chris Henderson, a wedding and portrait photographer, has been photographing a person a day for the past year as part of a fun Instagram project.Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/every-picture-taken-for-aberdeen-photographers-instagram-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=ej47imVawl\" data-secret=\"ej47imVawl\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"The rules were simple – to shoot, edit and upload a portrait photo every day, to find a new subject every day with no repeats and no self-portraits being allowed.Uploaded on his Instagram account chrshndrsn, portraits involve a range of male and female subjects, and include a caption with information about how he met the person and some details about them or the conversation they had at the time.He began the project on September 13 2017, posting an image of fellow wedding photographer Calum Riddell. Chris, 33, of the city centre, who will finish the project this week, said: “Part of it was because of the nature of my work, it’s quite easy for me to spend an entire day without leaving the building.“It was partly because I wanted an excuse to leave the house and speak to another human being every day.“Beyond that, I didn’t really have any objectives.”Most of the people he met were in Aberdeen, and two thirds of the people who were photographed had volunteered to take part. He said: “There were a couple of times I had to chase people down the street saying ‘excuse me’.“I started off with friends and family and former colleagues, but people started coming to me.“The vast majority have been people who have approached me.“There’s no way I would have been able to do it myself just having to approach people in the street.“It ended up being a snowball effect.“The idea of doing a picture a day is not something I dreamed up, it’s something a lot of photographers do.” Working as a wedding photographer, Chris often has to work with a backdrop that is outwith his control, so the project allowed him to look at dferent technical aspects while fuelling his love for portrait photography.He said: “It ties in with my interests. I like taking pictures of people.“Taking a picture of a dferent person every day meant I couldn’t fall back on the same people every day. I’ve allowed myself a bit of flexibility as well.”Although two thirds of his portraits ended up being volunteers, it wasn’t always easy to get people to take part.Chris likened the process to the famine and the feast, and said there were times he struggled to get back to people in time and others when he had only six hours left to find someone.With the end of the project nearing, he will be relaxing for a bit, but hopes to continue on the project in the future.He added: “I definitely want to keep doing something. Who knows, maybe in three months’ time.”There will be an exhibition held at Foodstory, which will begin in early October, upstairs in the cafe.To view the project, visit www.instagram/chrshndrsn.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"every picture taken for aberdeen photographers instagram portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery day for the last year Aberdeen photographer Chris Henderson has captured a portrait a day \u0026#8211 here we show every single picture taken so far.Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/daily-lives-explored-as-aberdeen-photographer-goes-face-to-face-for-year-long-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=jpVp6MTMOo\" data-secret=\"jpVp6MTMOo\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"funds for affordable housing in aberdeen agreed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFunding proposals for affordable housing in Aberdeen have been agreed.The Strategic Housing Investment Plan  for 2019-24 will now be submitted to the Scottish Government to sign off.Councillors approved £13.4 million of Section 75 agreement money – developers’ contributions – and from council tax income on second homes for the council house new-build programme.Aberdeen local housing strategy identies an affordable housing target of at least 342-384 properties every year.The Ship shows the potential to deliver 2,037 units in the next five years.The predicted spending is £18.133m in 2019/20 then £19.436m for the following four years.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali north east road shut after high winds blow down tree1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA busy north-east road has been shut this afternoon as strong winds have reportedly blown a tree down.Bus services and motorists have been erted after the tree fell on the A93 between Drumoak and Crathes.Stagecoach has apologised to passengers for delays and say their 201 and 202 service has been erted.Storm Ali: Winds of up to 75mph set to batter north-east as Met Office extends weather warning\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/winds-of-up-to-75mph-set-to-batter-north-east-as-met-office-extends-weather-warning1/embed/#?secret=G3o25CYrgX\" data-secret=\"G3o25CYrgX\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Storm Ali: Winds of up to 75mph set to batter north-east as Met Office extends weather warning\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u0026mdash StagecoachNScot  September 19, 2018\u0026mdash StagecoachNScot  September 19, 2018\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali reports of tree down on south deeside road","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice are warning motorists a section of South Deeside Road in Aberdeen is blocked.A tree is blocking the road near Leggart Terrace.The incident is one of around a dozen dferent roads across the region which have been shut or partially blocked due to Storm Ali.\u0026mdash NE Roads Updates  September 19, 2018\u0026mdash NE Roads Updates  September 19, 2018\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali watch people struggle to stay on their feet as ferocious wind closes va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tV\u0026ampA Dundee has closed to new visitors after ferocious Storm Ali wind swept people off their feet outside.Staff at the venue, which opened over the weekend, say “exceptionally high winds” at the entrance mean they are preventing new access this afternoon.The Courier witnessed members of the public struggling to stay upright as wind whipped in from the River Tay.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September. For the year so far that’s over 200 kids\u0026#8217 days out in total with around 60 kids at the Oban festival and around 70 kids at the Campbeltown festival.With funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust and the Ventient Energy A\u0026#8217 Cruach Community Fund administered by Foundation Scotland it is hoped to increase the number of festivals kids can attend and to get more teams through to Lochgilphead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"come on scotland","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/09/18, 5:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA healthy Mid Argyll support will be at Hampden this evening  to see Scotland take on face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium at Hampden Park.A bus load of 40 youngsters from Lochgilphead Soccer Centre headed off to Glasgow on Friday afternoon to cheer on Scotland in their friendly game.The match is a warm-up before the serious business begins on Monday September 10 as Scotland begin the inaugural Nations League at home to Albania.Here we go again.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

The Shanghai visitors were enthralled by the salmon cutting, curing and smoking process, every step seemingly captured on film \u0026#8211 except, of course, the mixing of the company\u0026#8217s secret salmon curing recipe. \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s based on salt and sugar\u0026#8217 was as much as Richard would reveal.There was a little puzzlement at the oyster sheds when it was explained that the iety cultivated are from the Pacic, but the sheer scale and emphasis on quality impressed them hugely. And the method of knocking oyster shells together to check for freshness is one that is certain to be deployed in the Shanghai fish markets.Lestyle guru Ya Shu said: \u0026#8216The system here is incredible. I have never seen anything like it.\u0026#8217It was back across to the restaurant to sample a mouth-watering selection of seafood dishes prepared by a team led by Calum Hall, Loch Fyne Oysters\u0026#8217 head chef.Before any food could be sampled, it had to be photographed. And filmed by mobile phone. And photographed some more.Plate after plate of food was served \u0026#8211 from langoustines to chilli and cheddar oysters, and from scallops to whisky-infused smoked salmon.The visitors thoroughly enjoyed it. \u0026#8216The food is very dferent from what we are used to,\u0026#8217 said Qui Qui. \u0026#8216But it is very good.\u0026#8217Ya Shu went from oyster sceptic in Shanghai to Loch Fyne Oyster lover. \u0026#8216I had a plate full of oysters, which I never liked before coming here, he said.\u0026#8216I also liked very much the smoked salmon, langoustines and scallops.\u0026#8217Well fed and watered, the group left Cairndow bound for Edinburgh while as the next leg of their 10-day UK tour, six of which were spent in Scotland and the rest in London.Chinese followers of fashion clearly like what Qui Qui does. A following of 566,000 people testies to her popularity. And with his words of wisdom on areas such as food, drink  and world travel, Ya Shu attracts no fewer than three quarters of a million followers to his blog.If just a fraction of these 1.3 million blog fans are intrigued enough to visit the UK, it will be money well spent for Visit Britain.These Chinese visitors fell in love with Scotland \u0026#8211 and not a blue-painted Australian in sight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish authors past and present celebrated at tarbert book festival","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/09/18, 6:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are still tickets available to attend the ious workshops of the long-awaited Tarbert Book Festival.In its sixth round, the annual programme of literary and poetic expression will run from Friday October 26 to Sunday October 28 and host writers from all over Argyll.On Saturday October 27, Robert Louis Stevenson is the subject of the opening sessions of this year’s weekend with Liz Shaw bringing her historical novel, ‘No Safe Anchorage’, followed by Bella Bathurst talking about ‘The Lighthouse Stevensons’, and Joseph Farrell concentrating on a new account of the final years the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde author spent in the South Pacic, with his book ‘Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa’.Closing the Saturday programme is an appearance by Bella Bathurst when she will discuss ‘Sound: A Story of Hearing Lost and Found’, which is her acclaimed account of the experience of going deaf in adulthood and how she eventually recovered.Tarbert Academy will host visits from Scottish poet, Stuart Paterson, and from the creator of the Sandy Seal books, Helen Cormack.Friday evening sees the awarding of the annual writing competition prizes in Loch Fyne Gallery.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

Eyewitnesses described a noise like an earthquake as the roof came crashing to the ground in Ayr\u0027s Phillips Square. Cars, including a Subaru Imprezza, were crushed underneath as the effect of Storm Ali was felt in full force. The impact of the storm blew the top of the flats off at around 1pm today. Resident David Hose, who stays on the top floor of the block, described the horrying moment.  David, 28, told the Ayrshire Post: It sounded like a mini earthquake, it was a bang like I\u0027d never heard before. I looked outside and couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The roof was lying on the ground on top of cars and not far from the school playground. It\u0027s a miracle it didn\u0027t kill anyone. Gordon Baillie, 36, a night porter at Ayr\u0027s Mercure Hotel, added: I was sitting on the couch watching telly and heard a big bang. I went to the window and saw my neighbour looking at his car as his Subaru was stuck underneath it. They\u0027ve taped everything off and we\u0027re blocked inside. My partner is still at work so he\u0027ll get a fright when he comes home. Emergency services have now shut off the road in a bid to clear the scene. Police wearing hard hats are on site with loose debris currently blowing around the affected area. It comes as a number of roads have been blocked due to falling trees and debris across Ayrshire.

He spent time in the Territorial Army which took him south to London for a stint guarding Her Majesty. Mason recalls: “He got to be involved in some pretty exciting things by all accounts. “He was on duty for the state visit of Nelson Mandela and because of his work I was born down in London.”  But the former car salesman, who served Arnold Clark Toyota in Ayr and Kilmarnock, would become renowned for his service to Ayr Boswell. Mason said: “He set up the 1997s team with Stevie Devlin and brought through so many kids, myself included. “We’ll have so many memories - as diehard Ayr fans we loved going to Somerset Park. “It’s no coincidence that the last game we went to together was when we beat Killie and our picture ended up on the back page of the Ayrshire Post! “He was my dad, best mate and coach all in one.” A fundraiser of former Boswell players raised more than \u0026pound8000 at Dam Park this summer.

87-mile cycle ride made in 1916 by the town\u0026rsquos legendary medical practitioner, Dr John Muir, at the age of 71.\nDr Muir served the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his family le and his day-to-day dealings with the public in a series of diaries.\nIn 2014, some 40 of Dr Muir\u0026rsquos diaries were presented by his descendants to the Scottish Borders Archive \u0026amp Local History Service, and these were then transcribed by staff at Hawick\u0026rsquos Heritage Hub.\nTwo years later, at the request of Live Borders, Selkirk playwright and actor John Nichol used material from the diaries as the basis for his one-man, one-act play, Dr John Stewart Muir: The Beloved Doctor.\nTaking the title role himself, John\u0026rsquos play received a rapturous reception at its premiere in the town\u0026rsquos County Hotel in February, 2017.\nOne scene features Dr Muir recounting an ambitious cycle ride he took to Moffat in 1916, ing via Boreland, Eskdalemuir and Ettrickbridge.\nIt is this ride that retired local GP John Wilson retraced last Wednesday, following the exact route described by Dr Muir.\n\u0026ldquoI always thought it would be amazing to recreate that ride, John told the Border  this week, \u0026ldquoso I\u0026rsquom just so happy that John Wilson was able to do it.\nJust as Dr Muir had done before him, John stopped off at Moffat\u0026rsquos Buccleuch Arms Hotel, where he was welcomed by director Polly Smith, while on the  journey he stopped at the Cross Keys in Ettrickbridge, where he was given a glass of water by owner Trevor Logan.\nDr Wilson\u0026rsquos encounters throughout the day were filmed by retired Selkirk journalist John Smail, who is making a documentary entitled A Souter\u0026rsquos Year, covering all aspects of le in Selkirk and the Valleys during 2018.\nAt the end of Wednesday\u0026rsquos ride Dr Wilson, himself an extremely proficient road cyclist, said he\u0026rsquod thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe landscape is spectacular and it makes you appreciate the history and cultural importance of this area.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure Dr Muir would have had similar thoughts and feelings.\n\"I can\u0026rsquot imagine that he

increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved

of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the

what the Scottish Borders has to serve up.\nBetween a food fayre, chef demonstrations and charity dinner, there was something for everyone to appreciate across the Local Food on Local Plates theme.\nKicking off the series, which took place during Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight, was a food fayre held at the Scottish Borders Campus.\nA total of 16 local producers and suppliers exhibited their products ranging from fresh fruit and baked goods, to homemade liqueurs and locally distilled gin.\nAll exhibitors were keen to not only raise the profile of their business in the local area, but also to support this inaugural event and provide inspiration to the College students.\nFormer College student Tegan Thomas from Galashiels was exhibiting the Thomas and Ethel Bakery.\nCompleting her catering course in 2015 with the intention of going on to train as a teacher, Tegan instead decided to use her newly gained knowledge and skills to set up a bakery specialising in allergy aware products.\nThomas and Ethel now operates on a wholesale basis from a unit at Tweedbank, priding itself on the bakery\u0026rsquos gluten free guarantee with items prepared in a completely safe environment.\nThe company is now aiming to supply to Morrison\u0026rsquos, as well as having been named runner-up wholesale bakery in The Scottish Food Awards 2018.\nBusiness students got involved in helping the stallholders to promote their goods, with one explaining on behalf of Caverton Mill Farm that the blueberries available for purchase had been picked only two days prior, making them a fresher option than buying from supermarkets.\nTilly Fuller, general mnager at Borderfields Oils, spoke of her desire to maintain a local connection for the 11 year old company, which was founded in Coldstream and now has its head office in Nottingham.\nRichard White of Freewheelin\u0026rsquo Brewery, makes the most of collaborating with local business.\nThe community owned brewery is hosted by the Peebles Hydro Hotel \u0026amp Spa, where the beer is stocked in the bar as well as being available for hotel guests to take home, making the brewery a unique visitor attraction.\nRichard was pleased to support the College food fayre, commenting that it was a great business networking opportunity as well as helping to raise the profile of the four old company.\nHot Sauce, produced in Nether Huntlywood near Earlston, is sold in delicatessens across the Borders, but the company is also reaping the rewards of e-commerce \u0026ndash not only are online customers their third largest customer base, they have shipped orders as far as Australia and New Zealand, opening up their product to a worldwide audience.\nAnd, Charlie Beaumont, Tourism Manager at The Borders Distillery in Hawick, quipped that they had brought \u0026lsquolocal gin in local glasses\u0026rsquo to the Local Food on Local Plates event.\nH added: \"We are really proud that our gin is made from scratch in

Lauder, Iain Gourlay of Cringletie House Hotel, Peebles, and a joint demonstration by Jonny Millar of The Townhouse Hotel, Melrose and Craig Gibb of the neighbouring Burts Hotel provided sold-out chef demonstrations.\nThe catering and hospitality students themselves benefitted from the demonstrations, where Jacqueline taught one group how to make puff candy and butterscotch sauce, and the students learned some new cookery techniques shown by the chefs.\nThe students also took the chance to showcase their own developing skills by serving light lunches and refreshments to customers from their barista bar throughout the day.\nJacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell ed the following day to host a very special charity dinner in the College Restaurant.\nTicketholders included members of local industry and College staff, amongst other food enthusiasts keen to experience a meal cooked by the reputable chef.\nJacqueline herself was supported by willing and able students from all three levels of Catering and Hospitality programmes, keen to add to their skillsets and experience.\nLevel 2 student Rebecca Sharpe was delighted to experience working with The Sisters Restaurant chef. She said: \u0026ldquoIt has given us a bit more experience and tips on how to prepare dferent ingredients, such as peeling hazelnuts.\nLevel 3 student Erin McAleer added: \u0026ldquoI feel like the dinner went really well, and it helped to enhance the skills I\u0026rsquom currently learning at College.\nMoney raised went to the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland , which provides support to a number of Borders College staff and students through craft scholarships, enabling them to enhance specic areas within their unique skillsets and to further develop their careers.\nCollege Principal Angela Cox highlighted that HIT Scotland\u0026rsquos mission chimes with that of Borders College in helping people to achieve their potential.\nDinner guests were served a smorgasbord of starters followed by a delicious lamb main course and trio of desserts, all created using local produce, many of which were purchased from food fayre exhibitors.\nChef Jacqueline said: \"Tonight\u0026rsquos menu came together under the Local Food on Local Plates brief, in collaboration with Borders College staff and students.

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S. Colville and Mr R. W. Greenlees in 1927.Mrs Mary MacFadyen, was the next winner to gain the christian name honour in 1928 and she did not have take three wins.The first and possibly only gentleman to see his christian name used, was the prolic 1950\u0026#8217s winner, Rev.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-shuts-suddenly","story":"  The County Hotel, run since 2016 by Tony Breathnach, has been shut since last Thursday.\u0026nbsp  The 10-bedroom High Street hotel, which also includes a bar and dining area, was leased to Mr Breathnach by Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars, part of Heineken UK.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

James Waters and Hugh Macdonald, artistic directors, said: \u0026ldquoThis year\u0026rsquos festival is an intoxicating mix of old and new both in performers and the music they play.  \u0026ldquoClarinettist and composer Mark Simpson is an extraordinary musical personality as artist in residence and his involvement has sparked a programme ranging from Stockhausen to Sch\u0026uumltz and presenting some of our favourite artists as well as featuring some thrilling festival debuts.  \u0026ldquoWe have had a lot of fun planning it and really look forward to sharing it with our audiences.  Following the huge success of the 2016 community opera in Dunbar , the Lammermuir Festival has commissioned a new community opera for 2018.  An Cadal Trom by Matthew Rooke features some 150 performers from Dunbar and across the county, a host of volunteers, and professional musicians, including McOpera .

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.

He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.  According to the planning officer\u0026rsquos report: \u0026ldquoIn a supporting statement submitted with the application it is stated that the proposal is part of Tarmac\u0026rsquos long-term internal upgrade and modernisation programme at Dunbar cement works.  \u0026ldquoIt asserts that the cement mill is necessary to produce new grades of cement required for modern construction and the cement market.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed mill will replace two existing mills on the site and will be more energy-efficient and quieter than those existing mills.  \u0026ldquoThe supporting statement also asserts that the cement works benefits from rail sidings on both the south and north side of the East Coast Mainline.  \u0026ldquoTrains run under a load out structure that feeds cement into rail tankers.  \u0026ldquoAt present, trains are fed only on the south side using adjacent silos where train capacity is already fully used.  \u0026ldquoAdditional products must therefore be exported by road.  \u0026ldquoUntil the late 1980s, the northern siding was also fed by a large silo that was dismantled. It is now proposed to reinstate a modern silo on this side to increase rail capacity.  Oliver Curtin, Dunbar Cement Plant manager, was pleased that permission had been granted, with further permissions to be secured before work gets under way, with staff levels to remain the same.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore pleased that East Lothian Council has approved our application to upgrade the facilities at Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThe plans will allow us to bring the latest technology to our operations, build on our offer to customers and maximise use of the rail network for transportation across Scotland and England.  \u0026ldquoWe will now work with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to secure appropriate operating permits.  \u0026ldquoOnce the necessary environmental permissions are in place, we will create a detailed plan for construction and operational timescales."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-pub-named-scotlands-best","story":"  The Volunteer Arms, known as Staggs, has been named\u0026nbspthe best pub in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to Ms Ford\u0026rsquos lawyers on Wednesday saying that the panel was giving the Calornia psychology professor until 10am on Friday to submit a biography and prepared statement \u0026ldquo she intends to testy on Monday.  It remained unclear, though, whether Ms Ford would attend or  the hearing would occur without her.  After initially saying through a lawyer on Monday that she was willing to appear, Ms Ford has since said she first wants a full FBI investigation of her accusation.  Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have been emphatic that an FBI renewal of its background checks on Mr Kavanaugh will not happen, saying an investigation by committee staff \u0026mdash which Democrats are boycotting \u0026mdash is sufficient.

Republican leaders are offering Ms Ford a chance to describe her allegation, either in a hearing room before television cameras or in private.  Republicans have largely stood by Mr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos denials.  Mr Trump told reporters, \u0026ldquoI can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.  Ms Ford has contended that at a house party in the 1980s, a drunken Mr Kavanaugh tried undressing her and stling her cries on a bed before she fled.  Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who has had her share of clashes with Mr Trump, said she hoped Ms Ford would reconsider a decision not to testy and \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos not fair to Judge Kavanaugh  she refuses.  \u0026ldquoOtherwise, there are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them, she said on radio WVOM in Bangor.  Senator Lindsey Graham said \u0026ldquoit is imperative the Judiciary Committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken as soon as possible.  As for a possible FBI intervention, Mr Grassley said in his letter to Ford\u0026rsquos lawyers, \u0026ldquoWe have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"relieve-the-gsa-of-responsibility-for-mackintosh-building-art-experts-suggestion-to-msps","story":"  Currently burnt-out, the Mackintosh Building is still at the heart, and perhaps is the soul, of the art school.  However, should the building, disastrously ruined by fire twice in four years, still be run by the educational institution?  That is the provocative question that will be posed to Members of the Scottish Parliament tomorrow by one of Scotland\u0027s leading Mackintosh experts, the writer and gallerist Roger Billclfe.  Mr Billclfe, a vocal critic of the GSA\u0027s responsibility for, and handling of, the building\u0027s first fire in 2014, has suggested in a submission to MSPs that the GSA should be \"relieved of the responsibility\" of the \u0027Mack\u0027.  He says that by the time the building is rebuilt - which GSA chair Muriel Gray said could take up to six years - it will have not been used as a place of teaching for more than a dozen years.  Billclfe believes that the building should be treated as a \"world class work of art\" and could be used as artist accommodation and for exhibitions.  : The Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt says chair  In the conclusion to his submission he says that, because of the unanswered questions around the 2014 fire, the GSA is \"unfit\" to be a custodian of the building.  Mr Billclfe said: \"Temporary accommodation put in force after the 2014 fire will likely have had to be replaced by more permanent arrangements.  \"This seems to be a suitable time to consider relieving the School of its responsibility for the Mackintosh building - something it is believed to have considered in the 1990s when it offered the building to a government agency - and removing the inherent dangers associated with its occupation by a large body of students.  \"This would remove from the School the apparent burden of running a major \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo and also satisfy the growing demand for access, particularly after the injection of \u0026pound30m of public, private and charitable donations to restore the building following the 2014 fire.\"  Mr Billclfe, whose latest book is \u0027Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Art of the Four\u0027, believes the Mackintosh Building, consumed in a blaze for which no cause has yet been established, should be rebuilt from the architect\u0027s plans.  : How the Mack will be remade: Muriel Gray interview  The Committee\u0026nbspis also hearing evidence from Eileen Reid, the former head of widening participation at the school, the architect Malcolm Fraser, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.  The prospect of the GSA giving up their right to the building appears unlikely.  However, there was much anger expressed after the June fire, and how two blazes could have occurred in four years.  The first fire, in 2014, was sparked by an projector igniting some expanded foam being used by a student for a degree show.  Until the police and fire service investigation into the new blaze is complete and published, observers, the public and alumni are in want of reply to questions over cause and responsibility.  : The new Mack will be paid for by insurance and fund raising  A spokesman for the GSA said: \"The Mackintosh Building was commissioned and designed as an art school and GSA is fully committed to it ing as a working art school.\"  In the Herald on Sunday, the chair of the GSA board, Muriel Gray, was adamant the GSA will restore the Mackintosh Building.  Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since 2014.  \"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"  She added: \"Imagine the thrill of saying, \u0027We have an architect for this project: who is it? Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\u0027\"  \"The roads lead back to Mackintosh, absolutely and non-negotiably.  \"As far as we are concerned that decision we made in 2014 has just been interrupted.\"  It has been estimated that the cost could be more than \u0026pound100m, but Ms Gray said she hoped this would be met by insurance and a private funding raising initiative, rather than rely on public funds.  : Mackintosh expert on the rebuild at book festival  The building was insured through an Owner Controlled Insurance Programme .  This was held in the name of the GSA and Kier Construction Scotland Limited, which was in charge of the works at the building.  The restoration of the school following the 2014 fire was due to cost \u0026pound49m in total.  A paper for the Committee says that the GSA have \"communicated with donors regarding the 2018 fire and no donor has requested a  of their donation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-potent-questions-linger-around-the-mack-and-the-gsa","story":"  However, after two fires in four years, not only Mr Billclfe, who suggests the change in his submission to the Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament, has expressed frustration and anger at the GSA.  In his submission, he says the Mack is a world class work of art - and should be henceforth treated as such.  He writes: \u0026ldquoIt would be unthinkable to restore a work of art from the National Galleries, say, and then offer access to it to the person who damaged it in the first place. But this is the scenario  the building is still to be retained by the School of Art on its current basis.  He also calls for a full investigation into the school\u0026rsquos administration at the time of the 2014 fire and subsequent refurbishment.  Billclfe, as others do, believes that the causes and circumstances of the original fire still pose many questions.  There is often anger when there are no quick or ready answers to potent and emotional questions. The world is waiting for the police and fire officers to investigate the ruins of the Mack, to find out what caused or accelerated the blaze this summer. I understand that the current theory is that the fire began in the roof of the east gable of the building, and then spread west and down to the ABC venue.

It followed a leak of papers from Brussels negotiators that the EU was edging towards a deal with the UK over Northern Ireland that would use technology to create a frictionless border.  The arrangement would maintain close alignment with the single market.  A newspaper report said the leak stated the solution was \u0026ldquospecically phrased for Northern Ireland so that it is not applicable for Scotland. A UK concern.  However Nicola Sturgeon has argued Scotland should be able to enjoy the same relationship as Ulster.  She tweeted in December \u0026ldquoIf one part of UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market, which is the right solution for Northern Ireland, there is surely no good practical reason why others can\u0026rsquot.  Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland yesterday, Mr Russell said: \u0026ldquoIf this is true then this is duplicity of a very serious degree by the UK government.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made it clear, both publicly and privately, over a long period of time, that whilst we entirely support a borderless Ireland...  there are advantages for Northern Ireland then Scotland could not stand idly by, and quite obviously so.  \"We voted, like Northern Ireland, not to Leave. Our economies are closely intertwined.  Asked whether there was a case for Northern Ireland having a unique arrangement given its history and its land border with another EU country, he said: \u0026ldquoWe would then border an EU country in those circumstances because the border would be in the Irish Sea.  \u0026ldquoBut it\u0026rsquos not an EU proposal. What the Times has reported is that the UK would be making it a condition that it [the deal] was written in such a way that Scotland could not take advantage of it.  \u0026ldquoIf they wanted to do that, they should have said to us - because there are open negotiations, the Joint Ministerial Committee is meeting - by the way, this is what we\u0026rsquore saying as part of the Northern Irish deal. They\u0026rsquove not done so.  \u0026ldquoNow that is neither fair nor welcome, and that is something we will be raising as a very serious issue.  He said he accepted there should be no border between Northern Ireland the republic, but he also said Scotland had voted heavily to Remain in the EU, and had long argued that a separate system for Scotland known as \u0026ldquodferentiation was possible.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have shown how that is possible, and we have published material on it. So  there\u0026rsquos an attempt to tie us to the UK, to drag us out against our will then we are absolutely right to object to that, particularly  it\u0026rsquos being done in secret.  Asked  the SNP would support a second vote on Brexit, Mr Russell said he would be \u0026ldquohappy to sit down with the LibDems and other proponents of a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  However he said it would have to factor in what would happen  Scotland voted again to Remain and the UK vote overall was to Leave."},{"url":null,"title":"article-50-author-says-second-vote-on-brexit-is-viable","story":"  Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who as Secretary General of the European Convention wrote Article 50, said the UK Government\u0026rsquos letter triggering the withdrawal process could be withdrawn and  Westminster willed it, there were \u0026ldquomultiple routes to holding another referendum on Britain\u0026rsquos future.  The Scottish peer\u0026rsquos comments - set to be ridiculed by the pro-Brexit factions and rejected by Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government - came after Sir Vince Cable told the Liberal Democrat conference that Brexit was \u0026ldquonot inevitable and urged Labour to dump Jeremy Corbyn  the Leader of the Opposition did not \u0026ldquofight Brexit and back a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  And last night, in a potentially signicant development, Michel Barnier made clear the EU was ready to come forward with an \"improved\" proposal on the Irish border \"backstop\" to reassure the British it would not lead to the creation of a frontier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  Declaring how Brussels wanted to respect the constitutional integrity of the Union, the EU27\u0026rsquos chief negotiator said: \"We are attempting to improve our proposals. What we are talking about here is not a border - not a land border, not a sea border it is a set of technical checks and controls.\"  Mr Barnier also told a news conference in Brussels the European Council on October 18/19 would be the \u0026ldquomoment of truth when it would become clear whether or not the two sides could agree a Brexit deal.  \"It is then we shall see  agreement we are hoping for is in our grasp,\" he declared.  His comments came as the Prime Minister prepares for tonight\u0026rsquos dinner at an informal EU summit in Salzburg, where she will seek to get support for her Chequers Plan from fellow European leaders.  She is expected to warn them in clear terms that rejection of her compromise proposals by MPs would lead to a damaging no-deal.  In a further sign of Mrs May\u0027s attempts to build support for the Chequers Plan, she met Manfred Weber, leader of the EPP - the main centre-right group in the European Parliament - in Downing Street on Tuesday.  A No 10 spokesman said: \"On Brexit, Weber recognised the Chequers proposals were a step forward and stressed the priority the European Parliament placed on resolving questions relating to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland as well as to maintaining the integrity of the single market.  Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, said Britain had shown flexibility and now it was time for Brussels to \u0026ldquoreciprocate.  \"If we are to get a deal there has to be compromises from both sides, he insisted.  Elsewhere, UK police chiefs agreed that the policing response to Brexit should be delivered at a UK level, including dealing with any civil disruption in the wake of withdrawal, while recognising Scotland\u0027s \"distinct constitutional arrangements\".  Humza Yousaf, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Justice Secretary, said while he commended Police Scotland\u0027s offer of mutual assistance to other forces, the decision was a \u0026ldquostark reminder of the hugely damaging impact Brexit could have on our security capabilities.  The Roadmap to A People\u0026rsquos Vote, written by Lord Kerr, states: \u0026ldquoThere would be no dficulty obtaining an extension of the Article 50 timetable to allow a People\u0027s Vote to take place. If Parliament judged that it was necessary to delay the March 29 deadline so that it could consult the people in a democratic vote, the Government would not face any political or procedural obstacle to this.  It adds: \u0026ldquoIf there is a deal, the most pressing question for the country would be whether that deal is better than the one we already have inside the EU. And  there is no deal, the country deserves the right to say whether it nevertheless still wants Brexit.  The crossbench peer said: \u0026ldquoThe die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time and, until the UK has left the EU, the Article 50 letter can be withdrawn.  \u0026ldquoIf there is a majority in Parliament for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge.  \u0026ldquoShould the UK need more time for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there is little doubt that the other 27 member states would agree the necessary extension of the Article 50 timetable, added Lord Kerr.  \u0026ldquoHistory will not be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-brexit-dominated-lib-dem-conference-as-vince-cable-waved-goodbye","story":"  The party leader used his farewell keynote speech to insist leaving the EU was \u0026ldquonot inevitable and that it could be reversed  the momentum for a People\u0026rsquos Vote continued to gather pace.

They, claimed the Lib Dem chief, had turned from \u0026ldquobroad churches into intolerant cults.  Which, of course, has left the fourth force in Westminster politics with a golden opportunity.  Yet despite the fact that loyal lieutenants were stressing how the party had doubled its appeal, from 7.4 per cent at the last election to 11 per cent-plus now - actually, a recent poll put the Lib Dems on just six per cent - the yellow peril is not picking up support anywhere near where it should be.

But  the Lib Dems are to capitalise on the anti-Brexit sentiment, then they need an energetic, charismatic leader, who doesn\u0026rsquot fluff his lines, to lead the charge to keep Britain in the EU as soon as possible.

She wrote: \u0026ldquoThere have been arguments made against our proposals that have been at odds with the reality of trade negotiations elsewhere and indeed the current trading relationship between EU member states.  Commenting on the EU\u0026rsquos original proposal \u0026ndash to keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union, thus moving the border to the Irish Sea \u0026ndash Mrs May declared: \u0026ldquoNeither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between dferent parts of the United Kingdom \u0026ndash which no other country would accept  they were in the same situation \u0026ndash or the UK seeking the rights of EU membership without the obligations.  Tonight\u0026rsquos dinner is expected to last at least two hours and will take place at the Felsenreitschule, the theatre where the Von Trapp family performed before fleeing the Nazis in The Sound Of Music movie, leading some to quip \u0026ndash the hills will be alive with the sound of Brexit. Tomorrow, over lunch EU leaders will again discuss Brexit albeit without the PM.  Tonight, the PM is expected to have face-to-face talks with Charles Michel, the Belgian premier, with further bilaterals with Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, and Donald Tusk, the European Council President, tomorrow.  Mrs May is likely also to talk to other leaders in the margins of the summit in an effort to win backing for a plan which has met fierce resistance from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.  Her message will be stark:  the EU does not show flexibility and the only deal she can take back to Westminster in November is an unsellable fudge, then MPs will vote it down and there will be a damaging no-deal.  In referring to the EU27\u0026rsquos improved offer, Mr Barnier also made clear that the \u0026ldquomoment of truth would come next month at the European Council. By then, he argued, it should be clear whether or not a deal can be done.  However, Brussels-watchers point out that there is a habit of the European Commission going to the brink and the Salzburg summiteers are expected to announce a special Council meeting in November, probably on the 13th and 14th, to formally seal a deal.  In an interview with the  today Mrs May said hers was the \"right plan\" for the UK while representing a \"good deal for the EU\".  She insisted: \"I\u0027m not going to be pushed away from doing what is necessary to get the right deal for Britain.\"  In her Die Welt article, the PM argues that the Chequers blueprint - a \"common rulebook\" for trade in goods and \"business-friendly facilitated customs arrangement\" - is the only way to resolve the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  \"It is profoundly in both sides\u0027 economic interest, it respects the integrity of the single market and, crucially, no one else has come up with a proposal that could command cross-community support in Northern Ireland that is the only true foundation for stability there.\"  She adds: \u0026ldquoTo come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.  Ahead of today\u0026rsquos summit, Mr Tusk wrote to EU leaders said EU leaders should discuss arrangements for the \"final phase\" of the Brexit talks \"including the possibility of calling another European Council in November\".  He impressed on them the need for \"limiting the damage\" caused by Brexit and added: \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.\"  Meanwhile, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said he expected just \"warm words\" from the EU leaders in Salzburg, stressing \u0026ldquothey won\u0027t give much\".  He asserted Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum of her deal or no deal was a false choice and predicted the EU would \"pile on\" extra demands on money, migration and other issues.  \"All these things will come back and we\u0027ll see more and more pressure, and she will have a deal she won\u0027t be able to bring back to the House of Commons because it\u0027ll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands, so she\u0027s going to have to have something else,\" he told BBC Radio\u0026rsquos Today programme.  He said a \"iety of options\" existed and a chance to \"reset\" would emerge in November.  \u0026ldquoWe get to a point where she will not be able to accept what they offer, they will not be able to accept what she offers, and there\u0027ll have to have some sort of reset. The reset is to step back to what Donald Tusk offered in March\u0026hellipa free trade agreement.\"  On Northern Ireland, Mr Davis added: \"That\u0027s one area where the EU is softening.\"  The Yorkshire MP noted how he had repeatedly told Mrs May there would be a \"pressure point\" late in negotiations.  \"[It\u0026rsquos] always the case with the European Union\u0026hellipthey move at the last possible minute after they\u0027ve tested your mettle, after they\u0027ve taken you to the clf-edge and that\u0027s what will happen.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lord-steel-says-may-should-call-off-brexit-and-back-peoples-vote","story":"  The Liberal Democrat grandee urged her to accept the process was simply too dficult and damaging and that, she should halt it and call a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  The 80-year-old Scot claimed during a public broadcast she could cite the Governor of the Bank of England, the IMF, the UK car makers and even the Chairman of the John Lewis partnership in support not of \u0026ldquoProject Fear but Project Reality.  \u0026ldquoI was active in the 1975 referendum but in this last one we heard little of the real reason for staying in the EU namely, the need to maintain a highly successful international unit which has guaranteed that never again as twice in the 20th century would the nations of Europe be at destructive war.  \u0026ldquoThe PM should promise to work for reforms in the institution and to steer government investment to the underprivileged parts of England who, in desperation, voted out.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn the words of the popular American song: let\u0026rsquos call the whole thing off.  The former Holyrood Presiding Officer\u0026rsquos remarks came as campaigners for a second EU referendum set out a roadmap to obtain a \"People\u0027s Vote\" giving the public the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.  The People\u0027s Vote report, written by Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested the PM could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs in Parliament or that she could even decide to call one herself.  And it insisted that the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\".  But Mrs May brushed aside the calls for a second referendum, saying voters had already made their decision.  \"When the referendum took place, we gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice,\" she declared.  \"This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country\u0027s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.  \"My answer to the People\u0027s Vote is that we\u0027ve had the people\u0027s vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,\" she added.  The report argues that the March 29 2019 deadline for Brexit could easily be delayed to make time for a vote to be held.  And it warned that politicians would be judged harshly  they denied calls for a People\u0027s Vote on the grounds that it would be too dficult to arrange in the short time remaining.  \"More than two years since the 2016 referendum, a political, economic and possibly constitutional crisis is gathering across the United Kingdom,\" said Lord Kerr, a former head of the diplomatic service.  \"Our view is that the most viable and democratic way of resolving it is to allow the public to have their say on Brexit. To deny them a voice challenges the basic principle of informed consent.\"  And the crossbench peer warned: \"History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country.\"  With opinion polls regularly finding a majority of voters now think the UK made the wrong decision to leave in 2016, the People\u0027s Vote report said it was not too late to \"think again\" about Brexit.  There was \"no insurmountable political or procedural obstacle\" to putting the two-year Article 50 process on hold to provide time for the necessary legislation and practical arrangements to be put in place for a vote, it argued.  And the report said a decision to dump Brexit now would be \"cost-free\" as the UK could retain its existing EU membership terms, including its budget rebate and exemption from joining the euro - while rejoining years later would require them to be renegotiated from scratch.  Drawn up by a cross-party committee including pro-EU MPs, peers and MEPs from Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens, the roadmap outlined six possible routes to a fresh referendum but said others may emerge as events develop.  The report explained that  Mrs May secured a deal with Brussels this autumn, MPs could use parliamentary amendments to force a referendum either when voting on the deal itself or on later legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement.  If her deal were rejected by the Commons, it would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not to permit MPs to vote on a fresh referendum when the PM faced Parliament to explain her next steps.  Although Mrs May has consistently said that she would not allow a second referendum, the report suggested she might decide that a public vote was the best way to win a mandate for her deal or to escape the \"constitutional crisis\" of no deal.  \"Facing the very real possibility of overseeing a deeply unpopular and potentially disastrous no-deal Brexit, she may decide that the only way to avert this outcome is to put her deal to the public through a People\u0027s Vote,\" suggested the report.  The sixth option of a vote following victory for a pro-referendum party in a snap general election within the next few months was judged \"very unlikely but not inconceivable\".  The roadmap made no recommendation on the question to be asked in any poll, something that would ultimately be a matter for the independent Electoral Commission.  But it said that, for reasons of \"simplicity, speed and clarity\", it was likely that a two-way choice - either \"the Government\u0027s deal versus stay\" or \"no deal versus stay\" - would be preferred over a multiple choice question.  Any vote should not be delayed by arguments over whether to extend the franchise to include 16 and 17-year-olds and expats or tighten social media rules.  But the report said social media companies should be warned they would face tougher regulation in future  they failed to take all actions within their power to prevent abuse of their platforms by campaigns.  David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, asked how likely a second referendum would be  Parliament willed it, replied: \"Pretty unlikely because most people understand to announce a second referendum would be to invite the European Union to give us the worst deal possible in order to persuade us to stay in.  \"That\u0027s the consequence of a second referendum and is why it\u0027s a very bad idea it\u0027s completely against the national interest.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website from his home in Bath, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action started last November.  It followed the Lothians MSP accusing him in her Daily Record column of making a homophobic remark about gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell.  Mr Campbell had said Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos son, the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, was \u0026ldquothe sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\".  In her column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets - Mr Campbell vigorously denies homophobia.  Until now, the UK labour party in London has bankrolled all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal support, paying for a QC and an advocate to conduct her defence at Edinburgh Sherf Court.  The costs so far are understand to be close to \u0026pound100,000.  However, to the shock of Ms Dugdale and many other Labour MSPs, the UK party has now ended the arrangement, leaving Ms Dugdale to fend for herself.  Although the party will bear all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos costs to date, it will not pay for any more legal counsel or any damages and costs  she loses.  It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.  UK Labour said: \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on a live, ongoing legal case.  Mr Campbell declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"carwyn-jones-general-election-needed-if-edinburgh-and-cardiff-vote-against-mays-brexit-plan","story":"  And the Labour leader made clear that a rejection of a Brexit deal by either the Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly could also eventually trigger a second referendum on the UK\u0027s relationship with the EU.  Wales voted to leave the bloc by a margin of 52.5 to 47.5 per cent in the 2016 referendum, although recent polls have suggested a swing towards remain. In Scotland, there was a strong majority \u0026ndash 62 to 38 per cent \u0026ndash to remain.  Setting out what he believes should happen  the Prime Minister secured a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, Mr Jones said: \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardf.  \"If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  \"If there\u0027s an inconclusive result as a result of that general election, well, how then do you resolve the issue without going back to the very same people who took the decision in the first place?

His remarks came as battle-lines were being drawn ahead of this evening\u0026rsquos informal EU summit in Salzburg when Mrs May will seek to convince her fellow leaders of her Chequers Plan.  But ahead of it, Whitehall sources suggested that she had already rejected the \u0026ldquoimproved offer on the Irish border mooted by Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator.  One insider explained that Mr Barnier had still not dropped his view that Northern Ireland should be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoAny backstop will have to respect our red line that there is not a customs border in the Irish Sea. Mr Barnier has not said anything to suggest that his position has changed on that, said the source.  Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May\u0027s minority administration in Parliament, gave Mr Barnier\u0027s proposals short shrt.  \"It still means a border down the Irish Sea although with dferent kinds of checks,\" said the party\u0027s deputy leader, adding: \u0026ldquoThe fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British prime minister could accept such a concept. It is not just Unionists who object.\"  Meanwhile, Donald Tusk made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Those positive areas included foreign and security policy co-operation, he explained.  But in a blow to Mrs May\u0027s approach, Mr Tusk noted: \"On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK\u0027s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.  He added that perhaps there was now \u0026ldquomore hope but there is surely less and less time\".  According to extracts released ahead of Mr Davis\u0027s speech, the former Cabinet minister will say: \"We have been told that the Chequers proposal fulfils what the British people voted for. Well, I am afraid I simply do not buy that.  \"Fty-two per cent of British voters oppose the proposals. Only 18 per cent approve. It is quite remarkable for a government policy to be that unpopular. And, for me, the Chequers plan was always a non-starter.  He noted how in her speeches at Lancaster House and at the Mansion House, the PM had promised to  control over the country\u0026rsquos laws, money and borders. These promises, he stressed, were in the Tory manesto too, yet the Chequers Plan crossed all of those red lines.  \"The EU is often correctly described as having a democratic deficit. But Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether.  \"This is why many of us will shortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision.\"  Mr Davis will go on to say that German companies should not fear a more competitive UK outside the EU but, rather, should \"embrace the opportunity that it will create for German workers, families and businesses large and small\".  \"In the long run, the friendly economic competition between neighbours is massively beneficial.  \"Beneficial for the German companies whose supply chains will be provided with improved components from British factories, beneficial for the consumers of tomorrow, who will enjoy the fruits of a more competitive global economy, and beneficial for the students and entrepreneurs of all Europe,\" the Yorkshire MP will add."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted 63 to 61 to pause and review tests for P1 pupils, after complaints from teachers about them being of little value, and parents reporting\u0026nbspchildren in tears.  The SNP government has promoted the standardised national assessments as a key tool to gather information about P1 children\u0026rsquos abilities and to fine tune their teaching.  The vote is not binding on the government, but was a blow to Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos reputation as Education Secretary, and a sign the opposition could embed it in law at a later date.  The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  The government defeat came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.  The Tory-led manoeuvre followed an often bad-tempered debate in which Mr Swinney and other SNP MSPs accused the Conservatives of rank hypocrisy and political opportunism.  Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party had previously advocated standardised tests at P1 and endorsed the government\u0026rsquos use of them in its 2016 Holyrood manesto.  Tory education spokeswoman said her party had been wrong in the past.  \u0026ldquoWe made a mistake about P1, she said, adding her party remained in favour of assessments at P4, P7 and S3.  She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along \u0026nbspwith them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  After the vote, other parties demanded the SNP respect the will of parliament, something ministers have repeatedly told Westminster to do on constitutional issues.  Ms Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has voted decisively on this matter, and now the SNP government must act on that. The nationalists have ignored the evidence on this for quite some time, but they can\u0026rsquot afford to any longer.  \u0026ldquoThese tests need to be halted, and the evidence re-examined. The SNP is always talking about how important the Scottish Parliament is and how its will must be respected.  \u0026ldquoThis is the perfect chance for the SNP to do just that.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard used a point of order immediately after the vote to demand the government respect the outcome.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers told this government that these tests were useless, ministers ignored them. Parents told this government that they do not trust these tests, ministers ignored them.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has now voted to scrap these tests and SNP ministers must not now ignore the will of Parliament. The Government must therefore bring forward immediate plans for how it will respond to this evening\u0026rsquos vote as a matter of urgency.  Green education spokesman Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos truly shocking about the introduction of these standardised tests is that all the issues highlighted by Greens and others were already well known when the SNP decided to press ahead.  \u0026ldquoMembers of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos own International Council of Education Experts have been at the forefront of these criticisms and ministers still cannot explain why they would ignore their own experts, never mind the voices of a majority of Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers.  \u0026ldquoNow a majority in the Scottish Parliament have joined the calls to scrap these tests for four and five year olds and in a fit of arrogance, the government seems set to ignore our decision.  \u0026ldquoThe concerns that Greens have raised are not limited to the P1 tests. The whole concept of standardised testing does more harm than good to our young people. John Swinney should follow the evidence, accept the will of parliament and scrap the tests immediately.  But SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said all the opposition parties were \u0026ldquoguilty of the most appalling hypocrisy for siding with the Tories to score political points.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government introduced p1 assessments because they are a tool we need to track kids\u0026rsquo progress and help drive up standards in our schools.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories put standardised P1 assessments in their manesto the majority of Tory-run councils across Scotland already assessed kids from P1 so did Labour and the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoLabour and the Lib Dems have sided with the Tories in their political gamesmanship, and sought to prey on the anxieties of parents, just to grab a headline.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos depressing that they all stood willing to do so at the expense of kids\u0026rsquo education.  \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to educating our young people, we should be united in an ambition to drive up standards \u0026ndash not exploiting these issues for political gain.  Sue Palmer, chair of the educational charity Upstart, which promoted a boycott of the assessments, said: \u0026ldquoThe opposition parties made many cogent arguments against the P1 testing and it\u0026rsquos very disappointing that the Scottish government isn\u0026rsquot prepared to listen to them.  \u0026ldquoWe at Upstart Scotland are particularly pleased that one of the closing speeches against the tests mentioned the long-term implications of beginning testing at such an early age in terms of children\u0026rsquos social and emotional development. \u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThere is growing evidence that the decline of self-directed play  coupled with an early focus on teaching specic academic skills is helping to fuel mental health problems among children and young people.    \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"new-details-of-45m-loan-to-firm-owned-by-fms-adviser","story":"  The Herald has learned the first \u0026pound15m tranche was given to Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, because it was\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoexperiencing cash flow challenges.  The problem was caused by cost overruns on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two CalMac ferries which have been beset by delays.  Despite the money trouble, records seen by the Herald say the loan was \u0026ldquounsecured, meaning not backed by assets, so  the firm goes broke taxpayers are at the end of the queue.  Ferguson\u0026rsquos is part of the Clyde Blowers empire owned by Monaco-based Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay learned of the cash flow issue in July 2017 and the loan was made last September, but he did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee until seven months later, when he sent a confidential letter referring to the trouble.  Until last week, there was no public record of the loan due to \u0026ldquocommercial confidentiality.  In June, Mr Mackay announced a further \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos to help it \u0026ldquoersy. However records seen by the Herald cast doubt on whether this will ever be repaid.  They show Ferguson\u0026rsquos could convert the loan into shares, which may not hold their value. In addition, the loan would not be repaid in a crisis until Ferguson\u0026rsquos insurance company, HCCI, was paid what it was owed first, as it is the first-ranked creditor.  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP have been anything but transparent. It took Derek Mackay over seven months to alert the Finance Committee about the first loan, and there are still huge question marks over the details.  \u0026ldquoHe then changed his story on what the money was for, saying that instead of ersication as first claimed, it was to plug a hole in the ferry contracts.  \u0026ldquoThis deal has been shrouded in secrecy. It\u0026rsquos not good enough for MSPs to go months in the dark - the SNP need to come clean and finally provide all the information surrounding these loans.

Opposition parties argue Mr Swinney must obey the will of parliament, but voting figures of 63 to 61 show how close the decision was.  It was exactly this ergence of opinion that Mr Swinney faced when he addressed an audience of educational professionals at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow on the morning of the vote.  As Storm Ali began to make itself heard around the auditorium of the SEC Centre, the minister would have expected a buffeting on testing as the audience of teachers, heads and other educational professionals were invited to ask questions.  It did not start well. A teacher from a primary school in Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said her experience of P1 testing was that they were not working.  \u0026ldquoThey are actually a huge waste of time and money in the way they are being enforced in primary schools, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not that I have an objection in principle to the idea of standardised assessments, but what I am seeing in practice is that they don\u0026rsquot work, they are not suitable and my colleagues around me feel exactly the same way.  \u0026ldquoThere is a widespread feeling in Scottish primary schools that they are not fit for purpose.  As Mr Swinney scribbled hastily into his notebook in preparation for a dficult answer, a headteacher from another primary school came to his rescue.  \u0026ldquoWe did not find any level of stress at all and the primary one children actually quite enjoyed taking part, she said.  \u0026ldquoIn terms of the feedback we found them to be extremely helpful. We had a small group of boys that I think we had the wrong measure of when it came down to teacher judgement and it changed how we looked at the support they needed. I think we had underestimated them.  \u0026ldquoThe depth of feedback and the quality of feedback the assessments gave us really helped those children.  Mr Swinney said the contrasting remarks illustrated the ergence of opinion on the benefits of the assessments for five-year-olds.  But what he was at pains to stress to the audience was his belief in the quality of feedback they could provide.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat literally drew an intake of breath from a group of teachers who went through the assessments with me was when they saw the diagnostic information and the way it was presented.  \u0026ldquoIt marshalled some of the strengths and the challenges that young people face and the purpose of standardised assessments is to make sure we are able to learn from what the experience of young people has been, what their challenges are and then to do something about it.  \u0026ldquoThe attainment gap exists when young people come into formal education and the challenge is to try and narrow that as quickly as we possibly can which is why I take the view that P1 assessments are helpful in that respect.  Lurking in the audience to hijack the Education Secretary further on assessments was Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union.  Mr Flanagan, whose union has backed a campaign to encourage parents to opt out of P1 testing, raised the issue of councils who blanket test pupils, rather than allowing inidual teachers to decide - a phenomenon blamed for greater levels of pupil stress.  Mr Flanagan said: \u0026ldquoA set of guidelines was produced, one of which was that teachers would control when these assessments were done.  \u0026ldquoWe know that 25 out of 32 local authorities breached that guideline and instructed teachers when to carry out the assessments.  With a nod to his past as a secondary school English teacher, Mr Flanagan then drew on the words of Hamlet to ask: \u0026ldquoSo in terms of empowerment, there\u0026rsquos the rub. How do we turn rhetoric around professional autonomy into a reality?  Mr Swinney conceded that he did not agree with Mr Flanagan on many things, and also expressed mock surprise the union leader had not taken the opportunity to raise the ongoing issue of pay.  But Mr Flanagan did get a concession from the minister on the need to ensure the guidance was being followed.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot always say this, but I agree with Larry Flanagan. The guidance is clear that teachers should choose at what point it is appropriate to undertake the assessments and that should be respected and I will pursue that in my discussion with local authorities."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-tells-eu-leaders-in-salzburg-chequers-is-only-credible-plan-on-the-table","story":"  As the Prime Minister promoted her compromise proposals over dinner with fellow European leaders at an informal summit in Salzburg, Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, intervened, arguing that  Holyrood and Cardf were to oppose the final Brexit deal, then there should be a general election, which could eventually lead to another EU referendum.  \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster Edinburgh and Cardf. If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  The Bridgend AM added that  there were an inconclusive result at an election, then there would be \u0026ldquopotential for a second referendum\".  When asked  the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Jones\u0026rsquos point about a potential general election, a spokesman for Michael Russell, the Constitutional Affairs Secretary, replied: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has already rejected Brexit and we will make sure that Holyrood has the chance to continue to make its voice heard as the Tories drag us close to the clf edge of a no-deal or a blind Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt simply should not come down to a choice between those options: the catastrophic or the merely disastrous, he added.  Before the Salzburg dinner began at the Felsenreitschule - the theatre made famous by the von Trapp family in the film The Sound of Music \u0026ndash Mrs May insisted her Brexit blueprint was \"the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people\".  She stressed: \"If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.\"  But ahead of the dinner Donald Tusk, the European Council President, made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Announcing a special EU summit in mid-November \u0026ndash which will set the scene for signing any Brexit agreement \u0026ndash Mr Tusk said that while there was \u0026ldquomore hope a deal would be done, there was \u0026ldquoless time in which to do it.  Today, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary in a speech in Munich will insist the Chequers Plan was \u0026ldquoalways a non-starter and he and his fellow Brexiteers would \u0026ldquoshortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision\".  On her arrival in Austria, the PM welcomed how Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, had recognised his original plan for the Irish border was unworkable and had sought to come up with an \u0026ldquoimproved solution. But Whitehall sources made clear that the private suggestions about Brussels\u0027s new proposals were unacceptable as they still did not drop the view that Northern Ireland could be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  Mrs May stressed: \u0026ldquoWhat we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away from the UK customs territory because, regardless of where the checks would be, what that would mean would be that it would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.\"  She also decried \u0026ldquoprominent Labour members like the Mayor of London, who were now trying to take Britain \u0026ldquoback to square one with support for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit.  \"I want to be absolutely clear, this government will never accept a second referendum, declared the PM, adding: \"We held a People\u0027s Vote it was the referendum in 2016.  \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union, it is now a matter of trust in politicians that we should deliver on the vote of the British people,\" she added.  Earlier, Lord Steel, the former Liberal leader, urged the PM to make a television broadcast to call off Brexit and announce a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoIn the words of the popular American song, he added, \u0026ldquolet\u0026rsquos call the whole thing off.  The intervention by the former Holyrood Presiding Office came after a People\u0027s Vote report, written by fellow Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested Mrs May could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs or that she could even decide to call one herself. It stressed the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\"."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govt-criticised-for-not-using-majority-share-holding-to-halt-rbs-branch-closures","story":"  The cross-party Scottish Affairs Committee had urged the UK Government that,  the bank did not act on its recommendation to stop the closures, then  should \u0026ldquouse any influence that its majority shareholding provides to apply pressure on RBS to reconsider the closure programme.  But the Government declined to do so, declaring: \u0026ldquoGovernments should not be in the business of owning banks nor should they intervene in the commercial, operational or management decisions of business.  Such decisions, it argued, were rightly the responsibility of boards and management teams, who were \u0026ldquobest placed to set strategy and commercial direction and to make day-to-day management decisions.  Last December, RBS announced it would shut a total of 62 branches north of the border but later ten of them were given a stay of execution until at least the end of this year, pending a review.  Committee member Danielle Rowley, the Scottish Labour MP for Midlothian, said the Government\u0026rsquos response was disappointing and showed it continued to \u0026ldquowash its hands of branch closures.  \u0026ldquoBut  it continues with its stated aim to  RBS to private ownership without making a strategic intervention to solve this problem, taxpayers will rightly ask what good their investment did beyond the initial emergency bailout, she said.  Ms Rowley accused the Government of being \"wedded to their dogma that the state has no role in the commercial banking sector, and claimed the Tories were missing a golden opportunity to make a positive dference and support communities across Scotland.  Noting how in her own constituency Bonnyrigg had lost the last bank on the high street and was now facing the prospect of losing its Post Office too, the backbencher added: \u0026ldquoThe evidence gathered by the committee was clear and our recommendations were reasonable. It is unfortunate that the Government has chosen to bury its head in the sand.\"  In 2008 following the financial crash, the taxpayer bailed out RBS to the tune of \u0026pound45 billion.  In June when the Government sold off another tranche of shares \u0026ndash at a loss of \u0026pound2.1bn \u0026ndash the public stake in the bank fell from 70.1 per cent to 62.4. The sale raised \u0026pound2.5bn.  The Government has said it intends to sell \u0026pound15bn-worth of RBS shares by 2023. The overall loss to the taxpayer is set to be around \u0026pound26bn.

Mr Wood noted, accurately, of course, that the British islands are in Europe, geographically and culturally, whether anyone likes it or not. He says the focus is purely a apolitical one.  Well. Whether you believe that or not  this notably yearning Hogmanay theme - which involves noted writers in a series of commissions, musicians, and others - however, cannot be seen separately from our context, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. Why else send a \u0026lsquoforget me not\u0026rsquo love letter?  It is fair to say that much of the cultural world is viewing Brexit with, as with the majority of Scots, alarm, consternation and dismay.  Mr Wood and Mr Bartlam, who are successful venue operators at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, know this.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot...

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusThursday 20 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 20, 2018 at 6:00 amThis week\u0026#8217s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.

The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nThursday 20 Sep 2018 7:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

Meanwhile, a hellish system of forced evictions and demolitions is forcing women and children out into the deathly winter.\nAlready brutalized by his battlefield exploits in Afghanistan, Ó Fiannaidhe is tipped over the edge by the injustice imposed by the British colonisers. Shelving plans to emigrate to America, he embarks on a solo revenge mission against corrupt police, brutal army officers, callous rent collectors, corrupt judges and haughty landowners that enforce the murderous British law. \nBarry Keoghan. A tit-for-tat chase across the West of Ireland ensues between the two, before finishing off in a climactic battle that sees ruthless Lord Kilmichael  as public enemy number one.\nDaly deserves credit for embedding the Irish language in multiple scenes across the film, serving to highlight the cultural and class gap between the occupying British forces and the oppressed Irish people.\noffers a first of its kind insight into le under occupation during famine struck Ireland, while personying the hardship faced by millions facing manufactured poverty.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.\nThe correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.\nBy her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.\nClearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.\nHer government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.\nShe had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.\nBut despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.\nInstead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.\nFaced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.\nIt also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls?\nAnd while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.\nThe aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.\nHer government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.\nThis reliance on the DUP remains the central problem and  any process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.\nThe Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere else on this is-land.\nLeo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.\nThere can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.\nThese are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.\nWhat is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark Moloney\n\nMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.\nFIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter.

is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

give vital safety advice for local students","story":"\nAs college and university students prepare for a new academic year, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council is encouraging students to keep safe by\u0026#160being aware of potential hazards in their home or student accommodation.\n\n                \nBeing mindful of potential hazards in the home and putting in place some simple home safety measures can make the dference between le and death.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHere are some of the main hazards in the home and steps that can be taken to reduce their risk.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCarbon Monoxide is a poisonous gas that has no smell or taste. It is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, coal and wood don’t fully burn. Household appliances that are powered by such fuels include boilers, gas fires, central heating systems, water heaters, cookers and open fires.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBreathing in carbon monoxide can make you unwell and,  you are exposed to high levels, can kill. Symptoms of carbon monoxide aren’t always obvious, particularly at low-level exposure. The most common symptoms include a tension-type headache dizziness nausea and vomiting tiredness and confusion stomach pain and shortness of breath and dficulty breathing.\n\nEnsure your home or student accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm in rooms where a fuel burning appliance is located and test the alarm regularly. If you have a gas appliance, make sure to ask your landlord for a gas safety certicate to show that it has been serviced annually.\n\nSmoke alarms should be installed on every level in student homes and should be tested weekly. Be aware of the dangers of phone chargers. Counterfeit phone chargers can be deadly as they are often made with poor quality components that fail to meet UK safety regulations. Always use the charger supplied with the phone. Never leave your phone to charge overnight as it can potentially cause a fire due to overheating.\n\nAlways remember to lock doors and close windows when leaving the house, even  it is only for a few minutes.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor information or advice contact Environmental Health on 0300 0300

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"primark donates 50000 to","story":"\n\nPRIMARK\n say they will donate £500,000 to Belfast City Council’s recovery programme, almost a month after the devastating fire at their city centre store.\n\nThe blaze at Bank Buildings has closed 14 nearby businesses that lie within a cordon around the iconic building which is set to be in place for at least four months.\n\nIn a statement, Primark said they are donating the money as a “gesture of goodwill”.\n\nA Primark spokesperson said: \u0026#8220Following the devastating fire at Bank Buildings, Primark has been focused on the welfare of our colleagues, while also working with the authorities regarding our on-going commitment to businesses and the wider community in Belfast. \n\n\u0026#8220It is our intention to be back up and trading again as soon possible.

Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

He is genuine in his belief that nobody should be isolated or victimised because of their sexual orientation.\n\n\"While I share his sympathetic outlook, I simply don\u0027t agree that iding people into categories does anyone any good. True equality doesn\u0027t care about labels.\"\n\nThe motion, proposed by Alliance councillors Gavin Walker and Andrew Muir at a corporate affairs committee meeting, passed by six votes to five, and now needs to be ratied at a full council meeting next Wednesday. \n\nMr Graham said that while he too wanted to see \"a unied borough where everyone was respected\", he didn\u0027t believe identity politics was the way to achieve it.\n\nHe also slammed the timing of the vote, which comes less than three months after Arlene Foster attended a Pink News event in Stormont. \n\n\"This is an attempt to drive a wedge between people after Arlene reached out to the LGBT+ community,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said the Alliance Party of today was far removed from its \"past desire\" to bring people together. \n\n\"The party used to be about uniting the community and removing isions but now they are committed to exploiting dferences and bringing about some kind of apartheid based on sexuality,\" he said. \n\nIt is not the first time that Mr Smith has broken ranks with his party on the issue. In 2017 he expressed support for PSNI officers participating in the Belfast Pride parade for the first time. \n\nPosting on Twitter, he also disclosed he had gay friends who had not disclosed their sexuality out of fear of the \"persecution and abuse\" they will face. \n\nThe DUP\u0027s Robert Gibson, who missed the committee due to a family commitment, refused to indicate which way he intended voting. \"I was not at the meeting or part of the debate, so I am not willing to comment,\" he said. Mr Smith could not be reached for comment, and the DUP did not respond to questions.\n\nUlster Unionist Mark Brooks, a gay councillor in Ards and North Down, voted in favour of the proposal.\n\nHe said: \"Councillor Smith is one of two \u0027ersity champions\u0027 on the council and it would have been a surprise  he had voted against the motion given his previous work in that area.\n\n\"DUP leader Arlene Foster made comments about embracing ersity and reaching out, and that\u0027s something I\u0027ve known councillor Smith to do.\n\n\"I can\u0027t comment on the other DUP members who voted against.

Michael Cooper/PA Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending:\n \nStorm Ali: Woman dies after caravan blown off clf - power cuts sweep Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n\nFive of the six DUP councillors sitting on the corporate affairs committee voted against approval.\n\nBut DUP councillor Tom Smith, who represents Donaghadee and Bangor East, voted against his party colleagues to see the motion go before next week\u0027s main council meeting for full approval.\n\nThe motion was proposed by Alliance councillors Gavin Walker and Andrew Muir.\n\nMr Walker said: \"We\u0027re obviously delighted that the motion was recommended, though that still comes against objections from five of the six DUP members on the corporate affairs committee.\n\n\"We\u0027re now looking forward to the full council meeting on September 26. We\u0027ll wait and see  Cllr Smith can have any influence on his DUP colleagues in making sure this motion is passed as it should be.\n\n\"Ards Town Hall has been lit up before and there\u0027s no reason why it shouldn\u0027t continue.\"\n\nMr Smith could not be reached for comment last night.\n\nThe DUP also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month there was controversy when DUP members of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council used a procedural mechanism known as a call-in to stop the Pride flag being flown on council premises.\n\nThe motion at Ards and North Down council called for its corporate affairs committee to back a proposal affirming that lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people be accepted and valued as equal citizens, with Ards Town Hall lit up in rainbow colours to coincide with Pride day.\n\nThe motion was supported at the committee by six councillors - three Ulster Unionist, two Alliance and one DUP - with five DUP councillors voting against.\n\nMr Walker added: \"As the father of a gay man, I know how much value parents place on creating an environment where our children can feel valued and accepted at a time when they need support in understanding their own minds and bodies.\n\n\"It might seem trivial to place store on the physical act of lighting council buildings in rainbow colours on Pride day, but the message of acceptance that will send out to our LGBT community, their family and their friends will be very powerful.\n\n\"There is nothing more isolating than feeling dferent to everybody around you. And when that is coupled with living in an environment which amplies that dference, then the pressure can be unbearable.\n\n\"As a council we are unable to change the feelings iniduals might have, but we can certainly create an environment of acceptance and love that will give our LGBT brothers and sisters time and space to fulfil their lelong potential.\"\n\nThe motion was presented by Alliance councillor Andrew Muir.\n\nHe said: \"I presented this motion in the hope that we could make a positive dference to the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people living, working or visiting our borough and I\u0027m delighted to have secured backing of the relevant council committee in affirming that LGBT people should be accepted and valued just like everyone else.\"\n\nIn June, DUP leader Arlene Foster made headlines by attending a PinkNews event at Stormont, where she told the LGBT community that she looks at them \"as my neighbours or my fellow citizens\".\n\nMr Muir hopes \"common sense\" will prevail next week.\n\n\"At the Pink News event on June 28 this year DUP leader Arlene Foster stated she wanted to acknowledge the contribution of the LGBT community in Northern Ireland and to recognise the reality of ersity among our citizens.\n\n\"She further recognised that some of our brightest and best in this country are part of the LGBT community. This motion is only a reflection of those words.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"over 1000 twitter users back northern ireland pet owner after pals ugly jibe at her","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Voting ended at 5pm yesterday. Postal votes were also available.\n\nThe DUP is currently investigating the North Antrim MP. When asked about the progress of the investigation, a party spokesman would only say: \"His membership is suspended pending the outcome of the party\u0027s investigation.\" \n\nIn March 2014 Mr Paisley lobbied the then Prime Minister David Cameron against a proposed UN resolution to investigate alleged human rights abuses during Sri Lanka\u0027s civil war without disclosing the holidays.\n\nNorth Antrim Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan yesterday removed a video posted on social media ahead of the petition\u0027s closure. The issue centred on complaints that Mr McGuigan had allegedly commented on the petition\u0027s outcome.\n\n\"I was contacted by the chief electoral officer warning me that the police could be asked to investigate a social media video I posted urging people to exercise their democratic right to sign the recall petition to remove Ian Paisley from office over his role in the Sri Lanka scandal,\" he said.\n\n\"I find it incredible I am being warned about police investigations when I do not believe there was anything in the post that predicted the outcome of the petition. If that is the case, are the bookmakers taking bets or the political pundits offering opinions also going to receive similar calls?\" \n\nVirginia McVea said: \"It is not up to this office to prosecute and I advised him of that and of the law in regard to the petition of recall process. The petition of recall legislation makes it a criminal offence to forecast the result. \n\n\"This is new legislation for everyone and I wanted to let Mr McGuigan know, and I understand he has taken the decision to remove the tweet.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tributes to devoted ulster aviation society member henry munn","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

funeral will take place today of a Lisburn joiner who became a key member of the Ulster Aviation Society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nHenry Munn, known as Harry, died of a suspected heart attack at his home on Sunday at the age of 70.\n\nAfter his we Anne passed away, Mr Munn decided to join the Ulster Aviation Society  10 years ago.\n\nHis natural enthusiasm for aircraft and practical skills soon made him invaluable, helping to restore and maintain many planes over the years, including a Second World War Grumman Wildcat and a Spitfire replica.\n\nToday, the close friends he made at the society have offered to carry his coffin.\n\nHe is survived by his mother Eileen, sister Lilian and brother-in-law Robin.\n\nUAS chairman Ray Burrows said Mr Munn was \"a lovely and gentle man\".\n\nHis last day alive was spent helping to move the \u0027Down\u0027 Spitfire at Aldergrove. \n\nThe replica has the Belfast  Spitfire fund logo on its side, referencing a wartime fundraiser in which readers of this paper donated money to build 17 of the famous fighters.\n\n\"We\u0027d never done that in one day before, taking the wings and blades off before assembling it again, which is pretty good going,\" said Mr Burrows.\n\n\"We then went back to the hangar at our Maze site, Harry left at 6pm and said \u0027I\u0027ll see you Tuesday\u0027.\n\n\"We were supposed to pick up the Spitfire, but sadly he was found dead on Sunday afternoon on his armchair with his overalls still on. \n\n\"Obviously, he came back from the hangar, put his feet up and that was it.\"\n\nMr Munn had been looking forward to an airshow in Duxford in Cambridgeshire this weekend.\n\n\"When his we died I think Harry was at a bit of a loss as to what to do,\" said Mr Burrows.\n\n\"He came to visit the hangar and he realised this was something he could take part in and from day one he just loved it and he became a really important member of the team.\"\n\nAlthough he wasn\u0027t a pilot, Mr Burrows said his passion for restoration work \"shone out like a bright light\".\n\n\"He was always the first to volunteer for trips to places like Poland, Frankfurt and Paris.\"\n\nAround the society\u0027s Maze hangar, the work of Mr Munn is everywhere to be seen from the planes to displays and door frames.\n\n\"Everywhere you look there\u0027s a part of him there,\" said Mr Burrows.\n\nMr Munn\u0027s funeral service takes place at 10am today at Ronnie Thompson\u0027s Funeral Church in Lisburn followed by committal in Lisburn  New Cemetery.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry campaign group takes brexit border message to

We don\u0027t want to go back to the dark days of violence and smuggling, and limits on a free community\nTate Donnelly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nOne issue that was addressed was the epidemic of border-smuggling during the Troubles and how easy it would be to restart due to the porous nature of Ireland’s border.\n\nTate Donnelly, from Co Monaghan, spoke about his experiences growing up in a house directly on the border.\n\n“When I go for a jog, or walk my dog, I can’t count how many times I cross the border and back again.\n\n“Before we lived in it, my house and the land around it was often patrolled by guards to catch smugglers. We don’t want to go back to the dark days of violence and smuggling, and limits on a free community.”\n\nIt is believed more than 30,000 people cross the Irish border daily, which has between 200 and 300 hundred crossings.\n\nIt has been estimated 7,000 jobs could be impacted in Co Donegal alone should a hard border be implemented when the UK leaves the EU.\n\nThe group – which is collecting signatures for a petition to hand over to political representatives from the governments in London, Dublin and Brussels – travels to London on Thursday to take their message across the Irish Sea.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more strong winds on the way after storm ali wreaks havoc","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Emotions getting in the way of food.\n\n\n\nPeople who can’t finish their food because they’re “upset”.

Well-paid junior staff… possibly living in Notting Hill. \n \n\n\nSo true. Notting Hill is vastly overpopulated with fictional characters. As is London in general. All paying manageable rent.

We’ve provided an opportunity for her to put her story fwd on Monday 2/4\n— ChuckGrassley  \nSeptember 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLisa Banks, a Ford lawyer, wrote that Mr Grassley’s plan to call just two witnesses, Mr Kavanaugh and Ms Ford, “is not a fair or good faith investigation” and said “multiple witnesses” she did not name should be included.\n\n“The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth,” Ms Banks wrote.\n\nRepublican leaders are offering Ms Ford a chance to describe her allegation, either in a hearing room before television cameras or in private. \n\nRepublicans have largely stood by Mr Kavanaugh’s denials.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley \n\n\n\n\nMr Trump told reporters, “I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.”\n\nMs Ford has contended that at a house party in the 1980s, a drunken Mr Kavanaugh tried undressing her and stling her cries on a bed before she fled.\n\nModerate Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who has had her share of clashes with Mr Trump, said she hoped Ms Ford would reconsider a decision not to testy and “it’s not fair to Judge Kavanaugh”  she refuses.\n\n“Otherwise, there are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them,” she said on radio WVOM in Bangor.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham said “it is imperative the Judiciary Committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken as soon as possible”.\n\nAs for a possible FBI intervention, Mr Grassley said in his letter to Ford’s lawyers, “We have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence.”\n\nIn a separate letter to Democrats, Mr Grassley wrote that committee aides were “even willing to fly to Calornia, or anywhere else, to meet her”. \n\nHe also wrote that Republican aides tried to arrange interviews with two other “alleged witnesses”. The letter mentioned no names and committee staff declined to identy them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public urged stay safe high winds heavy showers continue","story":"\nA local councillor has urged people to take all necessary precautions as the stormy weather continues.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell  has advised the Derry public to heed the current amber weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nIt comes after trees and hoardings and roof tiles have blown down across the city.\n\n\"I would urge caution as driving conditions will be dangerous at times and rail, air and ferry services may be affected.  There is also the possibility of longer journey times and cancellations are possible,\" he said.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“All road users should take extra care of loose debris and be mindful that tree falls and some structural damage are possible.\n\n“Power cuts may occur, and I would advise members of the public to report any damage to poles or electricity lines immediately and to stay clear.\n\n“People should keep informed about the weather and act to protect yourself and your home from the effects of flooding and high winds, and importantly to heed safety warnings.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"love island star touch derry beauty event foyleside shopping centre later month","story":"\nOn Saturday 29th September, Love Island 2018 favourite, Alexandra Cane will visit the North West’s premier shopping destination, Foyleside Shopping Centre, as the popular retail mecca hosts its fashion and beauty extravaganza of the year.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week.

balanced and accurate picture\u0026#8221 of the 1968 civil rights demonstrations.\n\n                \nEast Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said the event will counteract nationalist and republican events to mark the 50th anniversary of the demonstration which offered a “very biased and one-sided commentary”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAlong with Foyle MLA Gary Middleton, Mr Campbell will be screening a documentary entitled ‘Civil Rights – Righting The Wrongs’ on Thursday, September 27 at 7.30pm in the White Horse Hotel in Campsie, Co Tyrone.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Campbell said: “We want to give a more balanced and accurate picture of events around that momentous period. We will hear first hand accounts of how Protestants were forced from their homes in those days.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“1968/69 saw the start of what is often called the Troubles. During that time there was a massive movement of the unionist population – much of it due to intimidation and terror – from the west bank of Londonderry across the River Foyle to the east bank and further afield. \n\n“[The documentary] will reflect the views of local people, churches, community groups and political figures as they saw it in the 1980s.”\n\n                            \n

ago has gone on public display in Co Londonderry.\n\n                \nThe historical item, on loan to the Orange Heritage Centre in Limavady, contains the words of the monarch to Parliament at Whitehall in 1689, ahead of the Battle of the Boyne a year later.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe artefact is the latest signicant addition to the developing collection at the north-west facility, which already includes stirrups belonging to King William, and other objects from the period.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn his address, King William states: “The only reason that induced me to undergo so great an undertaking, was, that I saw the laws and liberties of these Kingdoms overturned, and the Protestant religion in eminent danger and seeing you are here so many Noblemen and Gentlemen, I have called you together, that I may have your advice, what is to be done for securing the Protestant religion, and restoring your laws and liberties, according to my declaration.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOrange historian and curator of the Museum of Orange Heritage, Dr Jonathan Mattison, explained it was through such speeches during the Glorious Revolution, King William outlined his rationale for accepting the invitation to take the throne of the British Isles.\n\nHe said: “Despite assurance that he would be received with overwhelming support, William was determined to ensure that his arrival was not seen as the supplanting of a ‘homegrown’ monarch with a ‘foreign’ king. \n\n“As a consequence, he and his we Mary embarked on a signicant propaganda campaign through the press and other publications, to explain their motives and, above all, emphasising that they were coming to defend the civil and religious liberties of the population.”\n\nMr Mattison maintains the new joint monarchy continued to “curry favour” with the establishment.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The item on loan to Limavady highlights one of those initiatives, as William III demonstrated his credentials to leading political representatives from Scotland. This was important as the Stuarts had a signicant power base in Scotland, a support that would see the creation of a Jacobite Highland army as the dethroned James attempted to retake his throne.\n\n“At this stage many of the political elites are trying to ensure that the transition from King James II to the joint monarchy under William III and Mary II is as smooth as possible – thus averting a civil war. \n\n“Such political horse trading and reassurance would work in England, but warfare soon broke out across Ireland and Scotland.”\n\nBoyd Douglas, trustee, said: “We are proud at Limavady Orange Heritage Centre to add to our growing collection with this excellent item from the Williamite period.  This item has been kindly loaned to us and we thank the owner of this item at this time for placing this item with us.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLimavady heritage centre is open to the public on Wednesday and Saturday from 10am to 3pm.
