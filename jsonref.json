For New Yorkers under lockdown, the sounds of the New York Public Library – rustles, taps, coughs, an echoing voice – are proving to be, if not paradise, then at least some kind of balm.Around 200,000 people have streamed the album of “audio landscapes” evoking the sounds of the city released by the NYPL earlier this week. Intended to transport listeners “to the daily urban orchestra they look forward to hearing again soon”, the NYPL’s Missing Sounds of New York ranges from a dance performance on the subway to rush-hour traffic, and the relative peace of a not entirely quiet library.Mentioned by governor Andrew Cuomo as one of his “deep breath moments”, the immersive album has been “popular, and impacting New Yorkers exactly as we hoped it would”, said Carrie Welch, the library’s chief of external relations.“So many New Yorkers have shared that the experience of listening has been emotional and poignant and cathartic,” she said, “allowing them to sleep or provoking memories of times in their lives or just reminding them of the city they know and love.”I’m not surprised it’s been a hit. Libraries are currently closed all around the world, and, while demand for ebook loans is booming, there’s far more to a library than just borrowing books. There’s the hallowed sense of being surrounded by learning, the peaceful community of being around other readers and the pervasive smell of books. While that scent might be hard to recreate – “A combination of grassy notes with a tang of acids and a hint of vanilla over an underlying mustiness,” according to experts – the virtual tours collected by Atlas Obscura can offer some of the delights we’ve all been missing.So I’m planning a virtual trip this weekend to Klementinum library in Prague, which with some justification describes itself as the world’s most beautiful. Its 360-degree tour – those globes! that ceiling! those ancient books! – coupled with the NYPL’s library soundtrack, a jar of grass clippings and a bottle of vanilla essence, might just be able to persuade me that I’m back among the stacks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a84e92356d4674a86cddae2e47040d92d21d916/0_83_3103_1863/master/3103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8bc3d8c84d437b6cb69a8efe7bad5c4","title":"bank of england interest rates covid 19 downturn us job losses business live","story":"Time to recapBoE governor Andrew Bailey said the slump was unprecedented, but he hopes GDP will bounce back once the pandemic is over.Economists cautioned that the economy may not recover as strongly as the Bank hopes, due to the damage caused by the virus.The Office for National Statistics has reported that two-thirds of firms have tapped the UK Job Retention scheme and furloughed some workers. It also estimates that roughly a quarter of companies are currently closed, particularly in the hospitality sector.In America, another 3.1 million people have lost their jobs last week, lifting the total to around 33 million.But stock markets have jumped in Europe and in New York, on hopes that lockdown measures will soon be eased successfully. “Markets, however, are now looking beyond the employment data and forward to the potential recovery. With some US states now beginning to reopen for business, investors will be watching closely to see how quickly employees return to work and how rapidly economic activity bounces back.A late rally has lifted the UK stock market to its highest level in a week.That’s its highest level since April 30th, last Thursday.The International Monetary Fund says it has approved requests for emergency pandemic aid totalling $18bn, from 50 of its 189 members, and is working through another 50 requests.Reuters has more detailsThe IMF’s executive board was working through requests at record speed and would consider a request from Egypt for both emergency financing and a stand-by lending arrangement on May 11, spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters in an online briefing.“It’s an IMF moving at an unprecedented speed in an unprecedented way to meet this unprecedented challenge which we’re all facing,” he said, noting the Fund had also temporarily suspended payments on IMF debts for 25 of the poorest countries.The gloom in the luxury goods sector is deepening even though some countries have started to relax their coronavirus lockdowns.Bain partner and report co-author Federico Levato says:“As consumers slowly emerge from lockdowns, the way they see the world will have changed and luxury brands will need to adapt.Safety in store will be mandatory, paired with the magic of the luxury experience: creative ways to attract customers to store, or to get the product to the customer, will make the difference.”Luxury accessories such as handbags have fared a bit better while watch sales declined the most, because of a lack of online sales platforms. Ronald Temple, Head of US equity at Lazard Asset Management, doesn’t share the exuberance in the markets today.“The US labor market is in the worst position since the Great Depression and is unlikely to improve sustainably anytime soon. Until widespread testing, an effective therapy, and a vaccine are in place, any improvement in employment is likely to be temporary.Premature efforts to reopen economies undermine our progress in controlling the pandemic and risk extending the duration of the downturn.”The Nasdaq has shrugged off Covid-19 fears because investors are rushing into “giant tech names that are considered more resilient in this crisis”, explained Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM.And here’s the result:Remarkably, the US Nasdaq index has now caught up all this year’s losses.The tech-focused share index is now flat for 2020, thanks to strong recoveries in major technology companies such as Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.As expected, the US stock market has indeed jumped in early trading.Investors may be taking some comfort that at least the pace of US jobless claims is slowing (but still terribly high).European stock markets are holding onto their earlier gains, despite the latest grim US jobs data.The spectre of unemployment is haunting America - but in some states more than others:Before the Covid-19 crisis began, America had never lost a million jobs in a single week before.It has now suffered seven consecutive weeks of massive job losses, as firms have slashed staff under the coronavirus lockdown.Our US business editor Dominic Rushe says some US states are really struggling to cope with the unprecedented surge in unemployment.Some 4 million have applied in California and the state’s jobless benefits fund is “very close” to running out, governor Gavin Newsom said this week. Here’s Dom’s story on the initial claims figures:Some instant reaction to the latest US jobless report:Newsflash: Another 3.1 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, as the US jobless crisis rages.That’s down from 3.8m in the previous week, but still another awful number.It lifts the total number of new ‘initial claims’ for welfare since the crisis began to around 33 million people.The US Labor Department also reports that 22.6 million people filed ‘continued claims’ (meaning they’ve been receiving help for more than one week).Stocks are continuing to rise in London, seemingly lifted by hopes that some UK lockdown restrictions will be eased soon.Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says:Our economic editor Larry Elliott says the BoE is pinning its hopes on a V-shaped recovery to GDP - and pushing banks to do their bit.One of the key messages from the Bank to the high street lenders was that they stand to lose more by not lending than they will by lending freely, because there will be more long-term scarring of the economy, more companies going bust and more losses for them to swallow. At his press conference, the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said he was ramming home this point to lenders at at every opportunity. But is this forecast too optimistic? Quite possibly, Larry adds:Forecasting is tough at the best of times: in the current circumstances – where there is uncertainty about how fast restrictions will be lifted, how consumers will behave, and whether there will be a second wave of infection – it is all but impossible.All that can really be said is that the risks to the Bank’s scenario are skewed heavily to the downside. Threadneedle Street decided against providing more stimulus at this week’s meeting, but it is only a question of time.In the event that the pandemic does return, Bailey said the Bank would find new tools from somewhere. That might sound a bit like Mr Micawber saying “something will turn up” but broadly sums up current thinking: this is bad, but somehow or other we will get through it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ed662e3838c28fc75df40f9aa943d7019482389/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19580ebc5acd931371a3f2e364eb66ba","title":"snapback uk economy lockdown recession coronavirus","story":"Recessions tend to centre on one part of the economy coronavirus has hit them all. The road to recovery will be longIn a way, Britain should have been the country best prepared for the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the economy, because throughout 2019 barely a day went past without someone popping up to warn of the dangers of a cliff-edge Brexit.But there are cliff edges and then there’s falling off the cliff, and not even the most pessimistic remainer would have been willing to predict what has happened since the UK went into lockdown at the end of March. While most of the attention has been focused – quite rightly – on the medical emergency, the economy has collapsed.Almost every part of the economy – outside food and drink and the public sector – has been affected. Factories have been mothballed estate agents have stopped selling houses bars, restaurants and hotels have closed footfall in high streets has dwindled to a trickle schools and universities have been emptied.The quarantining of the population has also affected every region of the UK. Parts of the country with relatively few cases of Covid-19 tend to be among the prettiest and attract the highest numbers of tourists. It is going to be an anxious summer for the hoteliers and restaurateurs of Cornwall, the Lake District and the Scottish Highlands.In the past, recessions have tended to be concentrated in one part of the economy. In the early 1980s it was manufacturing in the early 1990s it was housing and in 2008 it was the financial sector. This time it is everything at once, which is why the current slump is, by some distance, the most severe in recent history.To the extent that there is any good news, it is that the worst is now over. The tentative evidence from traffic congestion and job listings suggests that the economy hit the foot of the cliff in the middle of last month. April truly was the cruellest month.That said, there is little sign that the economy is going to bounce back rapidly. Most people can notice that there is a bit more going on: a few more cars on the streets a construction site that has reopened a bar doing off sales. But there is going to be no snapback of the sort that some were predicting back in March.The risk of a second wave of infection means that the lockdown restrictions will only be lifted gradually, and that process will prove too slow for hundreds of thousands of businesses that are burning through their cash and will go bust within a few months.Some of the biggest sectors of the economy – hospitality, retail, transport and travel among them – are going to be affected for a long time to come. It is hard to see how social distancing is going to be compatible with a visit to one of the tightly packed theatres in London’s West End or attendance at a Premier League football match.What’s more, consumer behaviour is bound to be affected by the lockdown. The government has spent the past couple of months warning people of the dangers of leaving their homes and it is going to be a while before they can be persuaded it is safe to have a meal in a restaurant, even if the tables are kept two metres apart. A snapback in the economy would require consumers to blow all the cash they have been unable to spend for the past two months, and that seems improbable.As the dole queues inevitably start to lengthen, even those fortunate enough to have escaped a cut in wages will get anxious. They will save more and spend less for fear that they could soon lose their jobs as well.All of which means that the government needs to act with extreme care. One of the lessons of the last recession was that austerity measures were imposed too quickly and recovery was choked off, and the stakes are much higher this time. Whether or not there is a second wave of infections there is certainly the risk of a second wave of acute economic distress starting in the autumn. The psychological impact of Covid-19 on consumer behaviour meant it was never realistic for the UK to have a V-shaped recession. The aim now is to avoid a great depression.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ba8d1689c7e1861258799436bba40b4e84dc83/0_143_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dab1a99bee6699c0cfae9dbd83e8399","title":"the story of australias pandemic can be told through the beaches","story":"First there was crowded Bondi, then the deserted beaches, cordoned off with police tape. If you look closely, a whole nation can be read on the sandA country reveals itself in a crisis. Americans are buying a record amount of guns, in the UK Boris Johnson was reluctant to implement a full lockdown because he baulked at the idea of closing the pubs. In Australia, it is our beaches that are the metaphorical hills that we are metaphorically dying on.Yeah, we want to beat this virus, but we also want to get a swim in.Even in normal times, we elevated a trip to the beach way above the inconvenience entailed. Think about it. You might take public transport or drive for more than an hour to get there, then have trouble finding a parking spot.Once there you risk getting swept away by a current or cut by coral or paralysed by body surfing into a sandbank.Even a good, uneventful day at the beach means sunburn and discomfort. It’s an effort to go to the beach. You need to wear special clothes, have a special towel, put on a lotion and think about your hair and the best time to go to the loo. The swim itself is always potentially perilous. Even in calm waters there are the first frigid minutes as your body adjusts to the cold. The shock is great. You go under. You emerge with a scream, but survive.Then what? Five, 10, 15 minutes in the drink? And there’s the aftermath – the frankly undignified walk from the sea to your towel (where is your towel?), aware only when you get there that your bikini top got twisted in a wave and you’re now exposing a boob. And then the impossible task of drying yourself while standing ankle deep in the very substance you are trying to remove. Your clothes feel clammy. A sudden wind, and sand becomes stuck to all your surfaces. You are coated, like a lamington.It’s still not over. You trail sand through the car and the house when you get home. It gets up your nose and in your hair. Weeks after your last beach visit, when the autumn leaves are dropping, the beach is still there in the cuff of your jeans, or in the toe of your shoes, or down the side of your sheets. A tug and a great volume of sand pours out.Yet even this … Even the disdain with which the beach often treats us, we return again and again – until we are forbidden.The defining images and in many ways the story of Australia’s pandemic has been told through beaches. First there was Bondi on the balmy weekend of 20 March. Crowded with people, the images horrified politicians and public health officials, prompting them to shut down the beach, and move Australia into stage three lockdowns.Then came the sad photos.While America had a vacant Times Square and Milan had Andrea Bocelli singing Amazing Grace outside a shuttered Duomo – Australia had a deserted Coogee beach, cordoned off with police tape.For weeks, my Instagram feed was full of pictures of empty beaches and sad-faced emojis. “Such a nice day, beach beautiful, can’t swim!”The pandemic news cycle began – mercifully – to slow around weeks four and five. One of the major Australian stories was the beaches. They’re open. Now they’re closed. Now they’re open for two hours in the morning, for exercise only – no loafing on the sand! Now they’re closed.In this strange time of shuttered beaches, elaborate plans were made. There were drives across the city to secret beaches. Everyone had the same idea. Even to post a photo with your toe in some water, somewhere, led to detective work of sorts. Where are they? Where is that beach? Are you allowed there??In other states – and out in the regions – people can swim. But the focus is on the perennial scene-stealer of beaches, Bondi.The residents of Sydney’s eastern suburbs have always been a bit despised by the rest of the country – but now with their covi-clusters and super-spreader “lifestyles” (flying all over the world, frequenting restaurants and bars, parties and celebrations, hugging, spreading germs), it is detectable, even in these socially distanced times, the schadenfreude much of the country felt over the closure of Bondi beach.But I suspect Sydney’s beaches welcomed the break. Only months before they were a soup of ashes, a reconstitution of ancient forests and incinerated koalas, the water emergency-red – a reflection of the eerie sun. Ash washed up as dark lines and spooky marks on thousands of kilometres of sand. Swimming in the ash-filled beach felt like a too-intimate communion with the climate apocalypse.But now the sky is clear again and we want to swim, our bodies having calculated there was a lost summer. The sight of the clean water beating on the empty sand, the air warm and dry, the smell of the salt and the sounds of pounding surf is enough to drive us into a frenzy that can in part be explained by desire, and a simple sensory pleasure, denied.When the beaches reopened, in Maroubra someone painted “locals only” on the sea wall. There are dark echoes in this time of other famous beaches: not Anzac Cove or Mallacoota on New Year’s Eve 2019 – but Cronulla, one scorcher in the summer of 2005.We bring to our beaches – to our swims and our surfs – not just our towels, but some complicated baggage. If you look closely enough, a whole nation can be read on the sand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df1772d8f02962269e52db572c83254dcc380ce/81_406_6830_4098/master/6830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40fbf17edf982b965e7aa234a2031be6","title":"families sue government over little or no education for their children","story":"DfE failed to ensure access to online learning by providing laptops and wifi, lawyers sayFour families who say their children have received “little or no education” since schools in England were closed to most pupils by the coronavirus lockdown have started legal action against the government.Lawyers acting for the families say their intention is to sue the government over its failure to ensure access to the online learning that has largely replaced classroom teaching since March, because the four are unable to afford laptops or internet connections.Clare Jennings, a solicitor at Matthew Gold law firm, said the Department for Education’s scheme to provide laptops and internet access for some was restricted to only a small number of pupils, leaving many others without reliable access to online lessons.Teachers in England report pupils having to share laptops or tablets with family members, including with parents working from home. Many schools have distributed or bought their own devices to give to their pupils.The four families living in the south-east of England are eligible for universal credit or local authority support, and include five children eligible for free school meals, aged between 6 and 13, attending local primary and secondary schools.“The government really hasn’t engaged with the number of children who need access to the internet. They don’t seem to have really addressed how many children are missing out on their education because they don’t have a laptop,” Jennings said.The DfE announced on 19 April it would provide devices to disadvantaged year 10 pupils, as well as pupils who had been in care or assigned a social worker. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs that 200,000 laptops would be distributed, at a cost of £85m. Internet access will only be provided to year 10 pupils.But most of the devices will not be delivered until June, while an investigation by Schools Week found that schools were being allocated only a fraction of the devices for which they were eligible.One school, Longdean school in Hertfordshire, said it had applied to the DfE for 66 devices for its year 10 pupils on free school meals – but were told they would only get 21.Jennings said the families have sent a “letter of claim” to the DfE to start proceedings, but that she hoped the department would instead “respond positively” and provide extra resources to allow all children to learn online.The move comes as researchers at the London School of Economics warned the schools closures could open a “chasm” between the education of low-income children and those from better-off families.Andy Eyles, one of the authors, said: “It is clear that children from more advantaged backgrounds attending schools where technology is in place to substitute for classroom teaching, and whose parents have both the time and skills to plug the deficit, are likely to be less adversely affected by the closures than others.”The report said options that could help overcome the lost learning include: having pupils repeat the entire year schools opening over the summer holidays extending the school week by two hours for every week of closure and a funding injection of £1350 per pupil to improve teaching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb280a9dc8c37a5849d9098d50ae0e5a44df6920/0_47_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beea4df18828534c28d1e39f6df33665","title":"students lockdown affected final year university coronavirus","story":"Classes, exams, celebrations and even graduation ceremonies have all been upended by coronavirus.

She has been sharing a daily image with them via Blipfoto for the last six and a half years, but photographing nature has provided a particularly welcome escape in recent weeksCutting short our holiday to Cuba as Covid-19 took off, it was an eerie feeling transferring through an emptying Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in the middle of the day with the shutters down on duty free. I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got home but, while life felt uncertain, I knew my wildlife - my haven - would still be there. The countryside around Burley-in-Wharfedale, my home, has become my daily sanctuary, now more than ever.One stick, five gates. Living in a village, we have the luxury of the countryside on our doorstep, but with it, comes the challenge of multiple gates, now being handled by multiple people. A carefully chosen single-outing stick is doing the trick nicely for every type of opening.Walking much closer to home and for less time, I’ve been worried that I wouldn’t be able to find my moment with nature anymore, but something always turns up. Here a tawny mining bee fell out of a tree in front of my lens 300 metres from home.I’m finding moments arriving as if on cue, just when I need them the most. The last time I saw a brimstone butterfly was 2017, so imagine my delight at spotting this one glaring at me in the sunshine in front of a deep gorse dell.Normally I just enjoy happening on butterflies as the season warms up, but this year I’ve taken utmost pleasure from looking out for which one is due to emerge next - from the hibernating overwintering adults to the first to emerge fresh from their pupae. The green hairstreak is a local favourite of mine - surprisingly easy to miss!Even this elusive chiffchaff seemed willing to be on film. Perhaps having recently arrived and being hungry, this one was less cautious about being captured as it picked off tiny bugs from budding trees.I call this one “crouching toad, hidden dog”. Our dog can’t walk as far as she used to, but I managed to time one of my few walks up onto the moors since lockdown perfectly for the day the toads got active. Perhaps the out-take should have been my record as one clambered onto my glasses when I took a moment to read the settings on my camera.It seemed trivial to be photographing a bee on the day after it was announced that Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus, but I’ve concluded that everyone has to hang on to their sanity in their own way.In Yorkshire we can’t have been luckier with the weather recently. We’ve had the luxury of days on end of blue skies and the birds have been making the most of it too.It’s been the colours and the shapes of nature as well as the expressions of wildlife that have given me a daily smile in these uncertain times. In particular, I’m finding the spring colours of lemons and limes giving me a real boost. This willow warbler taken through gorse is my recent favourite. Wildlife has always been and will continue to be my sanctuary.Over time, I’ve found a few local nooks and crannies to keep an eye on at different times of the year. This is one of them in a beautiful woodland back garden I walk past. This kestrel seemed to be owning the space here, but in the last few days the jackdaws have moved in and the kestrel has reluctantly moved two metres upstairs into another box. They live with physical distancing as the norm. It works. I’ll hold onto that thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc4fe143007c41d44807da54251f1ff8122db4c3/0_171_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb5cf4b3495a6f39ac3ff42027e241f4","title":"my favourite film aged 12 fly away home","story":"I idealised this as a movie about the beauty of the natural world. I realise now its also about surviving loss and finding strength when everything looks hopelessMy love for Fly Away Home coincided with moving to the countryside where my mum and I had lived in cul-de-sac after cul-de-sac, our new home was surrounded by only a cluster of other houses, and then field after field. The Canadian prairie it was not – you could just make out the lights of the out-of-town supermarket from our garden – but it was around that time, I think, that I started to understand the benefits of the great outdoors. Fly Away Home, similarly, begins with a new start, albeit under more traumatic circumstances. After her mother dies in a car accident, 13-year-old Amy moves from New Zealand to Canada to live with her estranged father, Tom. He’s eccentric, a sculptor and inventor with a home full of odd creations, including a replica of the lunar lander. And then Amy finds a nest of orphaned goose eggs. Being the first thing they see when they hatch, she becomes their Mother Goose – feeding them, teaching them to fly and, eventually, guiding them south for the winter with the help of her father and two home-built ultralight gliders.I wanted to be just like Amy, attuned to the natural world. I had grand plans of spending my days in the fields around my new home. I would learn to identify trees and bugs at a glance, and imitate bird calls. I turned out like any other teenager of my generation, of course, watching Friends for hours and spending far too long perfecting my MySpace profile. But now as an adult, especially one living in London, I crave nature. Even in normal times, I become antsy if I’m cooped up inside for too long. I need a regular dose of country air, to stand on top of a hill and feel the wind rattle through my hair and my clothes.But, it appears that I have idealised Fly Away Home. It’s not simply a film about the beauty of the natural world. It is far more touching than I remember, and it hits me harder than it ever did when I was younger. Less than a minute in, and my eyes well up. There’s the driving rain, the windscreen wipers, and the last moments of laughter between a mother and her daughter, all accompanied by the haunting and beautiful 10,000 miles by Mary Chapin Carpenter. I may have loved this film growing up but I never did like to watch the opening scene, knowing what tragedy was about to occur – and it’s no different as an adult.And I can’t stop. I cry when Amy wakes up in hospital and realises her mother is dead. I cry when she doesn’t remember her father’s chaotic home, and when the geese first take flight. And then Tom’s glider crashes 30 miles from their destination. He can’t continue, and Amy wishes her mother was with her for the rest of the journey.“She is,” says Tom. “She’s right next to you. She’s in the geese, she’s in the sky. She’s all around you. She won’t let you down.” It’s too much, I’m a blubbering wreck until the credits roll.I had thought the predominant feeling I’d have after rewatching Fly Away Home would be a desire to be within nature, a pull to lace up my walking boots, jump on a train headed for the countryside and plod through muddy fields. But instead I yearn for what I don’t – and can’t – have right now normalcy, family gatherings, sitting in the park, pub drinks with friends. I see now that so much of Fly Away Home is about loss and grief, and I feel bereft. For the first time since lockdown, I am so acutely aware of what and who I am missing, and what we could all stand to lose.But Fly Away Home is also about surviving those losses and that grief, of creating new normals and finding strength even when everything looks hopeless – and for that I love it all the more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/930075e05e2eb16f3bab9f0e05ec937c29af0972/372_43_3909_2345/master/3909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b63cb42586d901322e161837b9ceb01e","title":"sundance film festival coronavirus incubator","story":"The Hollywood Reporter says numerous attendees returned from the late-January festival with coronavirus symptomsA new report suggests that January’s Sundance film festival, the annual gathering of cinephiles in Park City, Utah, may have been a key early hub for coronavirus in the US. The article, in the Hollywood Reporter, cites numerous attendees who experienced Covid-19-like symptoms either during or immediately after the festival. None were believed to have been tested for the disease.Sundance this year attracted about 120,000 people to the small mountain resort, to watch films and party in confined spaces. The snowy conditions that make Park City perfect for skiing mean that socialising indoors is common, as are some flu-like symptoms as a result of the low temperature and high altitude.Yet this year’s “Sundance plague” appears to have been more virulent for regular attendees than earlier iterations, with many complaining of considerable difficulties breathing, multiple trips to hospital and at least a fortnight bedbound.The Hollywood Reporter cites – but declines to name – one major actor who apparently became “gravely ill” after the festival, as did members of his entourage. They quote the Black List founder Franklin Leonard saying he became sick on 28 January, when he flew home to LA. Shortly after, he says, “I was barely functional … as sick as I’ve ever been for two weeks.” Leonard reports that at least two others he knew of cut their festival trip short due to illness.A spokesperson for the Sundance festival said: “We’re sorry to hear that any of our festival attendees were unwell either during or after our January edition. We are not aware of any confirmed festival-connected cases of Covid-19.”The article’s thesis has been defended by festival-goers on social media who have been sharing their own stories of post-Sundance illness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/921ecce90f9245413ff7a305110f16d83d905144/120_0_2403_1443/master/2403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3890301c5640d98ee69fc83ea18e2cfd","title":"magnificent holiday meals nine dishes to transport you instantly from moules marinieres to jambalaya","story":"During lockdown, readers have been recreating food that takes them back to happy travel memories and delicious voyages of discoveryAfter a gruelling six-hour journey from Penang to Krabi in an overcrowded minivan, my then-boyfriend and I stopped off at Mr Krabi, a restaurant run by a Jamiroquai-loving Italian gentleman and his Thai wife. For my first meal in Thailand, I ordered krapow gai, and it was the perfect antidote to the trauma of the trip. The bird’s eye chillies combined with succulent chicken mince and holy basil and topped off with a fried egg were heavenly. I fell in love with the dish there and then, and vowed to learn to make it as soon as I got home. The dish reminds me of the trip, the exhaustion and stress of the journey to get to it, but also of the pure comfort it gave me when I ate it.I recreated the dish soon after my return when I asked my close friend (who is half Thai) if she had a go-to recipe for this, which she did. The recipe itself is very straightforward. I can even dictate it from memory to my boyfriend in the kitchen while I lie on the sofa nursing a hangover (which this dish always helps me get through). The hardest part about making it is finding holy basil. The Asian supermarkets rarely stock it and it’s much easier to get your hands on Thai basil, which is sweeter. Normal supermarket basil is a more acceptable substitute.I was in a bar in Bilbao a few summers ago. As soon as a tray of these arrived, they disappeared, and when we asked for some more, we were put on a waiting list. We had three helpings, and never found them on offer anywhere else, so just went back to the same bar every day for our fix.My Spanish evening-class tutor came from Bilbao and gave me the recipe. To recreate it, we cooked the mussels, chopped them with onions, garlic and white sauce, put the mix back in the half shells, then topped them with breadcrumbs and deep-fried them for a minute or so. It was easy and although it had a different texture from the originals, it was very tasty nonetheless.I’d always wanted to go to Athens, but, unlike with other city breaks, I wanted to visit for longer, as I didn’t want to be rushed. So I decided to find a voluntary project to teach English to refugees.At a taverna on the beach, I had my first taste of gemista. I was famished, and, alongside a fellow volunteer, tucked into the most satisfying meal. I close my eyes and am transported back just thinking about it.I made it several weeks ago in lockdown. There is lots to prepare, and I was apprehensive because I have never cooked rice in the oven. But it was delicious. I sent a photo of my version to a friend in Kos and he said it looked perfect. I have promised to make gemista for him when I can travel to see him.On our honeymoon, my wife and I had landed in Pisa after a delayed flight. We made our way to Florence and spotted this dish being served in the central train station. It was presented as a peasant dish, with strips of fried or roasted polenta, served with spinach, white beans, tomatoes and olive oil. I was delighted to find a vegetarian dish so easily in the heart of Italy.I have never seen it in a cafe or restaurant since, and don’t know what it is called. I have made it many times at home, for meals and parties the ingredients are easy to come by.I make it by cooking the polenta and allowing it to cool and set. I cut it into strips, wider and a little longer than a modern polenta chip. I roast these in a sprinkle of olive oil, along with some tomatoes, onions, garlic and some salt and pepper. At the end, I will mix in the beans – whatever we have … cannellini, butter, pinto or borlotti.A few years ago, I went on a tour of Jordan. My host family prepared this dish for me and I fell in love with the mix of lamb, yoghurt, rice and spices. It is a very rich dish, always prepared for weddings and other ceremonies. It is so famous in Jordan that you can easily find T-shirts that say: “I Survived Mansaf”.Unfortunately, I haven’t made it during lockdown as most of the ingredients are not available in the area where I am isolating. But I have prepared tons of homemade hummus, which also reminds me of my trip to the Middle East. Upon arrival in Bogotá, Colombia, in December 2016, my travel companion and I went in search of an ajiaco. We were not disappointed. We knew right away that we wanted to recreate the hearty stew of chicken, potatoes and corn.Our friends were teaching in Bogotá at the time and gave us a gift of the herb guascas when we left. Apparently it is not really an ajiaco without guascas or papa criolla (Andean potatoes).We first made it back in the UK in early January 2017. The very first obstacle was the lack of Andean potatoes. I’m sure lots of Colombians would disagree, but it can be made using a variety of potatoes available in your area. One of the things that makes this dish fun – and delicious – are the bits that you add to it. Topped with capers and a swirl of cream, avocado on the side – and cold beer. It is on the menu tomorrow night – when the avocado will have ripened – and we can’t wait.I had eaten the dish at the fabulous brasserie Aux Arms de Bruxelles, and when we got back I just simply had to taste it again. It took a few attempts to get the sauce right, as the mussels held too much salty water, but I played around and finally got the consistency and flavour just right. This dish speaks to me of friendship, laughter, beautiful memories and dear friends. On a recent trip to Brussels just before lockdown, we ate at the same restaurant, and they sat us at the same table as we had sat at several years earlier on our first visit. I have made this dish on a number of occasions, but the best was probably one long hot summer when I lived alone in a cottage in a village outside Cambridge. I cooked it over charcoal, in a genuine tagine pot I had picked up for a song in a local market in Marrakech. I had eaten this dish in a remote cabin, which an old bus had stopped at while crossing the Atlas mountains. Just there, high on a mountain pass, with the smells of tagines cooking, and snowmelt streams running by, it tasted amazing. I am no stranger to cooking, and had studied carefully how tagines were being cooked in Morocco, so it was not difficult to make.I first made it after coming home from an amazing trip to the deep south. One of the best things about seeing new places is discovering the food and how that connects to the wider history of where you are. New Orleans has an amazing story where a cocktail of different cultures combined to create not only jazz but an incredible culinary history. Jambalaya is very similar in many ways to paella, but spicier, with the addition of creole spices. I make paella a lot, especially on holiday, so it was pretty easy to adapt it to make jambalaya. My secret tip is to make a shellfish stock using chicken stock as a base to really pump up the depth of flavour when you cook the rice. I try to break up the lockdown week by cooking more holiday-inspired dishes on the weekend. Whether that’s a chicken laksa soup or some smoked Memphis-style ribs on the barbecue. Jambalaya is a Friday night special alongside some chilli-infused grapefruit margaritas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500e9fb692b831bbb5f9de85e5655d3d0e8d6307/1490_956_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2018b602b77c60c9237ef881438d4c","title":"beans three ways a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple","story":"As a nation it’s safe to say we are baked bean lovers, and for years families have been passing on their unique bean recipes. Anna Masing serves up three fresh dinner ideas and gets the family stories behind the recipesYou can’t beat mopping up that delicious sauce with a piece of bread after a fry-up. But beans have moved on from the cooked breakfast. People proudly boast about their personalised recipes and each generation adds a new twist to a family favourite. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, there’s always room for beans on our plate.With increasing health concerns about the reduction of sugar in our diet, Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz lets this comfort food become a convenient staple for health-conscious people. Here are three recipes built from love and tradition for you to try.Recipe developer and food editor Nadine Brown makes this dish for her family – her partner, her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old niece: “It’s perfect for a hungry family with little patience,” she says.The dish is based on a recipe Brown developed a few years ago, but with tweaks made specifically for her family. Beans have always been a favourite in their house: “They taste great on their own or in a dish like this,” Brown explains. “The basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,” she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: “It helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.”This dish is also about ease – it’s a “bung it all in one” dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown’s household, when they don’t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.Ingredients8 pork sausages4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed1 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, cut into wedges1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz30g basil leaves, roughly torn300g cherry tomatoes on the vineFreshly cracked black pepperCrusty bread to serveMethodPreheat your oven to 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6.Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: “My mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.” For Zoe’s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. “Mum has the recipe nailed so it’s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband’s palate.”This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: “A rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum’s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.“When discussing this recipe with Mum,” Zoe says, “she revealed its greatest quality – using what you have.” Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards – especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.A store cupboard classic this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe. Without the optional bacon, it works as a main dish for vegetarians, and without the wine and chilli, it’s a great supper for kids.Preparation: 10 minutesCooking time: 20 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesServes: 4 as a light meal or 6 as a starterIngredients1 large red onion, chopped3 garlic cloves, crushed2 medium carrots, dicedHalf a red pepper, diced1 400g tin chopped tomatoes1 415g tin of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz1 handful of orzo or similar small pastaSaltfreshly ground pepperParmesan cheese (including rind)1 tsp Heinz tomato ketchup1 tbsp light olive oilA pinch of dried mixed herbs1 bay leaf1 small red chilli or a small pinch of chilli flakes (optional)125ml wine (red or white) or 2 dsp dry vermouth (optional)4 rashers of streaky bacon (optional)MethodSweat the onion, carrot and pepper gently in the oil for about 5 minutes.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: “My parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad’s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.”This has stood him in good stead – on a lads’ getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.Rehncy’s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house a memory he has is his father’s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist – onions, spices and chillies – the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. “When you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,” says Rehncy. “I chose these spices because they’re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household – classics.”He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 white onion (finely diced)4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)2 green chilli (finely chopped)1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp garam masala powderSmall bunch of fresh corianderMethodAdd the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you’ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion.Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly.Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes.Add the spices – turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the “masala mix” you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz.Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated.

Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

My mum used to bake bread. I can still remember waking up to the smell of her amazing little crusty rolls. We’d have them with crispy bacon, eggs and baked beans and that was just a little plate of joy to start the day. I can still taste it when I think about it.Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things. It’s so comforting, it’s like the Caribbean version of mashed potatoes. Then you put curried goat or chicken or fried fish on it – or just more beans. If you’re tired or lonely, sad or happy – whatever it is – rice and peas will generally sort it out.These days I’ve become more aware of sugar in dishes. A honey glaze here, something else there and, before you know it, you’ve pushed the sugar levels way up. For me it’s all about balance now. And low-sugar products are great for that.You can also bring out sweetness using existing foods on your plate, for example when you’re cooking your onions or leeks, let them go for longer because they create their own sweetness as they caramelise. It takes a while to adjust to that different kind of sweetness but it really works. Or add some cumin and a little salt to carrots and roast them to enhance their sweetness.It’s no surprise to me that beans are such a mainstay of so many cultures. Brazil has feijoada – black beans and pork stew. Families come together and add farofa, a toasted cornmeal, to it. And think of pasta e fagioli in Italy. There’s a familiar heartiness that beans evoke for me and historically they’re a food that people without much money could afford.We see them as humble but forget how versatile they are. They’re a brilliant carrier of flavour and add real depth and ballast to a plate. They’re a kind of security food. When I became a mother, I’d send my kids to school on beans on toast because I knew it was going to last and fill them the right way. My daughter Miquita was also a big fan of my cheesy baked beans. It was a kind of Welsh rarebit with a bit of Worcester sauce, all bubbling under the grill with silky beans and crusty bread underneath.The most exciting thing in cooking is when you take something people think of as humble and transform it into something really delicious and surprising. People forget the ways they can use the tin of beans in the cupboard – they’re haricots in tomato sauce, which is the basis of so many dishes. That’s why I came up with this recipe, which combines pork and beans – an age-old combination. Watch any cowboy film and that’s what they’re eating.In this dish, I use tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz to pair with the pork the creaminess of the beans and the salty, spiciness of the pork just makes me really happy.

Take the pork belly, slip it into an ovenproof dish, rub in all the spices, then pour in the stock. Cover with tinfoil, and place in the oven for at least 90 minutes, and up to 120 minutes – the meat needs to be very tender so that when you test with a skewer or small knife it is soft. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a board or rack to cool it down. Reserve the cooking juices left in the pan as well. Take the meat and pull it apart or roughly chop it up. As with the juices, leave to one side.Take a good heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter, add the oil, then all of the other ingredients except the beans. Soften the ingredients very gently over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until they are very soft and caramelised. Add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, pour in the cooking juices from the pork belly.

Cook the burgers on the barbecue, a griddle or in a frying pan, depending on the weather, and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles.For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table.Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea.Feelgood fish and chipsReplace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably.Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad.Guilt-free chocolate browniesIt’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar!Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively.A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories.Alternative beans on toastYes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family.Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm. Spoon the hot beans over one tortilla using a slotted spoon so you don’t get too much sauce (no one wants soggy tortillas), and mash the beans lightly with a fork. Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top. Cut into four and serve with a big green salad, and a slightly smug feeling on the side.While you might not be able to stop the cravings, you can transform your food with a few healthy swaps – like using Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, sneaking in some extra vegetables, or getting creative with your cooking.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":null,"title":"assassins creed valhalla xbox series x","story":"Xbox livestream showcases new titles designed to support the advanced features of the forthcoming consoleMicrosoft has revealed 13 games coming to its Xbox Series X console when the machine launches this winter. In an hour-long presentation, streamed live on Thursday, the company announced that well-known titles such as the recently announced Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, as well as Madden NFL 21 and Yakuza: Like a Dragon, will all be on Xbox Series X.Also featured was Paradox Interactive’s vampire adventure, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2. Codemasters presented its racer DiRT 5 complete with impressive lighting and mud splatter effects, and an option to run it in 4K at 60 frames-per-second or in a lower resolution at 120fps. Namco Bandai showed a new anime-style sci-fi thriller named Scarlet Nexus, about a group of psychic law enforcers.The rest of the games were from independent studios: futuristic first-person action shooter called Bright Memory Infinite, which is already coming to PC supernatural horror game The Medium from Blair Witch creator Bloober Team (with music by Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka) a 1930s puzzle adventure named Call of the Sea from Swedish indie publisher Raw Fury space combat shooter Chorus from Deep Silver cyberpunk action-RPG The Ascent from Curve Digital Second Extinction, a three-player co-op dinosaur shooter from Systemic Reaction and finally, Scorn, a first-person horror adventure set in a sinister Giger-esque dream world developed by Serbian team, Ebb.The games will support the key technical features of the Xbox Series X such as 120-frames-per-second animation, real-time ray tracing and super-fast loading times. Nine of the titles, including Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, will support Microsoft’s new Smart Delivery technology, which will allow players to buy one version of the game that will then run on either Xbox One or in an optimised format on Xbox Series X.Speaking during the livestream, Ashraf Ismail, creative director on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla said, “Assassin’s Creed has always been committed to new technologies to push the experiences.

Norway and England are living worlds and to push their potential has been wonderful.”Microsoft has also confirmed that all 15 of its first-party studios are working on Xbox One X projects, but did not show footage during the stream. During the stream, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Studios, announced that gameplay would be revealed from July, including Halo Infinite.An exact launch date for the next generation console is yet to be confirmed beyond “Holiday 2020”. A price is also yet to be revealed.With major gaming events cancelled around the world, the company has announced that it will be running a series of monthly online news livestreams titled Xbox 2020, showing trailers and developer interviews.A blogpost published to Microsoft’s Xbox Wire site said: “Hundreds of titles are already in development for Xbox Series X thanks to our amazing partner community.“We’ll be sharing a lot more in the coming months in our Xbox 2020 series, not only from those partners but from Xbox Game Studios as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9cd4ba524c8ef63f09a3652daa99182f7e1f2fc/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef47244e995e30fc1a2b2792027bf39e 1010w","title":"public trust in uk journalism eroding amid coronavirus polls suggest","story":"Research paints mixed picture of people’s relationship with news outletsWhile the coronavirus pandemic has been delivering record audiences for news organisations, some polls suggest public trust in British journalism is simultaneously eroding.In recent weeks a number of consumer surveys have painted a mixed picture of the public’s relationship with news media organisations.A recent YouGov poll of 1,652 people for Sky News found that two-thirds of the public don’t trust TV journalists, and almost three-quarters don’t trust newspaper journalists. This has been attributed by some Conservative MPs and commentators to the mainstream media’s sometimes aggressive questioning of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, arguing it is out of step with the mood of a panicked public seeking national unity during the crisis.“We never come out that well in polls, we’re never going to be up there with Mother Teresa,” says Mark Austin, an evening news presenter at Sky News, who has been vocal about the issue.“People think you are either with us or against us,” says Richard Sambrook, a former director of global news at the BBC and the director of the Centre for Journalism at Cardiff University. “People trust media less when they don’t see it supporting their point of view and instincts. You have the camp that’s saying we must rally around Boris in this moment of national crisis. And another camp saying that the government must be held to account on important questions.”A significant factor at play is in the wording of survey questions. For example, the Sky News survey simply asked the public about trust in journalists per se. A very different picture of public trust emerges when looking at specific media and organisations.Polls by YouGov, the Reuters Institute, and Survation, which asked 3,029 people, Ipsos MORI and weekly research by Ofcom, the broadcasting and media regulator, of 2,000 people, have all found that broadcasters and newspapers are widely considered to be the most trusted sources of information on the coronavirus crisis.“There simply has been no collapse in public trust in news media during the coronavirus outbreak,” YouGov concluded after examining trust levels recorded in its polls of 1,643 people from during last year’s general election up until last week.“Public service broadcasting is having a good crisis in terrible circumstances,” says Roger Mosey, former editorial director at the BBC and master of Selwyn College, Cambridge. “The factual information from the BBC, ITV and Sky has been good. Anecdotally and from what I see in public surveys people respect what is being said.”When it comes to newspapers, there is a significant ergence in perceptions of public trust. , Financial Times, the  and the Times have trust levels in some cases close to TV news broadcasters. Survation and the Reuters Institute have the  as the most trusted newspaper doing the best job of covering the pandemic. YouGov found in an examination of six months of data that public trust in what it calls these “upmarket” newspaper titles has remained completely stable.Mid-market and tabloid titles, such as the Daily Mirror, Daily Mail and the Sun have historically had much lower levels of public trust. There has been no erosion of these lower levels of trust during the coronavirus pandemic, YouGov found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9a2204be51e38d408f7639cfa5b088cd6ef68b/0_193_5837_3504/master/5837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41de3a3e61f9a0ca67b4906719210d3f","title":"how can i find a new place to live with social distancing in place","story":"My partner has moved out but my landlord insists I keep on paying the full rent although during lockdown I can’t moveI shared a flat and rental payments with my partner until March when the relationship ended and he moved out. The fully paid-up tenancy lasts until mid June and the notice period is two months, so if I don’t want it to roll over, I need to give notice now. Due to social distancing rules, I don’t know if I’ll be able to move house in June, but equally I can’t afford to keep on paying the rent by myself. I have offered the landlord a reduced monthly rate between June and August, after which I will move out if lockdown is lifted. The landlord, a multi-national corporation, is adamant that I must pay the full market rate if I stay, even though they are unlikely to find a new tenant during the pandemic. I’m faced with the prospect of having to move out while being uncertain as to how I’m going to view, sign up to and move into somewhere new with the social distancing regulations in place.There will be many couples in a similar position, especially as lockdown puts pressure on relationships. The government has urged landlords to compromise if their tenants’ financial circumstances change during the pandemic, but this is guidance only and so there is no legal obligation on landlords to agree.Shelter housing adviser Andy Parnell suggests that you pay as much as you can with or without the landlord’s agreement. “If the landlord doesn’t agree to reduce the rent or to delay payments, the tenant should keep them updated on how much they can pay, and how they plan to make up the costs in the future,” he says. “This could help persuade their landlord or letting agent to come to an agreement. And if the landlord considers eviction or takes legal steps to recover unpaid rent, the court involved may take the tenant’s efforts to resolve the situation into consideration.”You can’t be evicted in June because when a fixed-term tenancy agreement comes to an end, the tenant usually still has the right to occupy the property under a periodic rolling tenancy without signing a new rental contract, until the landlord takes legal action to end it.“The tenant can end the rolling tenancy simply by serving written notice as required by their contract,” says Parnell. “In contrast, the landlord usually has to serve written notice and then apply to court for a possession order and a bailiff warrant to evict them. Under the new coronavirus legislation, most landlords now need to give three months’ notice as a minimum and, as court proceedings have been temporarily suspended, landlords won’t be able to carry out evictions even when notices have expired.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff969f20f624a89c5585d3811598674ac134743/0_12_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74704683d58599724162bdf64e619e5e","title":"reopening mississippi americas poorest state begins lifting lockdown podcast","story":"Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops.

Carrie Symonds had merely looked confused. In desperation, Boris had next tried to ring Dominic Raab, but the phone went straight to voicemail. The foreign secretary wasn’t that stupid: there was no way he was going to risk a hat-trick of humiliations. Dominic Cummings had then gently taken the prime minister by the arm and led him to the Downing Street front door. It was time. The point of no return.So it was a decidedly reluctant and somewhat sheepish Boris that appeared for his first prime minister’s questions up against Keir Starmer in the Commons. He had the air of a naughty schoolboy about to appear in front of the headteacher for repeatedly failing to hand in his homework and expecting a prolonged detention as punishment. If only Boris had managed to get off that lightly. By the end he had only made the situation worse by making countless promises he had no idea he would be able to keep and which would be certain to be added to later charge sheets.For all his life Boris has managed to blag his way out of any tricky situation. Half Flashman, half Billy Bunter, lies and half-truths have been his stock in trade. But in Starmer it is as if he has instinctively realised he has met his match. A power greater than himself. There was little of the prime minister’s familiar smirks, bluster and banter. Weirdly, he didn’t even really make much effort to put up a fight. Just a series of mumbled excuses that he didn’t expect to be believed.Not that it’s any great shock Starmer has turned out to be so good at PMQs. First off, he’s an inherently serious man and these are serious times. He’s also had years of practice in cross-examination as a QC, so he’s learned how to fine tune his approach. He asks the right questions in the right manner. Never raising his voice, the stiletto in his hand is his courtesy. A death by a thousand kindnesses. What was more surprising was just how easy it all was for him. Keir will have had a harder morning’s work defending a shoplifter at Snaresbrook crown court.It turns out that the simplest way to compromise Boris is merely by using his own words against him as evidence. Starmer started with a gentle warm-up. Two weeks ago, the prime minister had boasted of our apparent success in dealing with the coronavirus. What part of a death rate of more than 30,000 – the highest in Europe – did he consider a success? Johnson barely even attempted an answer, muttering that he hoped one day the international data might produce the conclusions he wanted. Besides, now was not the time for any kind of public inquiry. Or ever, if possible.From there on it all went steadily downhill for Boris as Starmer observed it was the government’s own data that highlighted the UK’s unwanted top spot in European coronavirus deaths. Wasn’t it the fact that we had been too slow to lock down, to test, to trace and to provide personal protective equipment? Why had it taken 12 weeks to recognise the danger in care homes? When were we going to see a proper strategy as opposed to a few barely literate slogans?Boris visibly wilted under the most gentle of onslaughts. Maybe he’s still not fully recovered from his illness. Maybe his time in intensive care has provided him with a conscience that had hitherto been absent. Or maybe he somehow realises the game is up. That he was essentially a prime minister for the Good Times, someone to lift spirits with delusional appeals to jingoism. All of which could take place in a moral vacuum of no consequences for him. Now, though, he knows he’s been found out. That his failures have left him with blood on his hands that no amount of washing for 20 seconds while singing Happy Birthday can get clean. He has become Lady Macbeth.Whatever the truth, Boris could not prevent himself from sleepwalking into further incriminating himself. It was an outrage, he said, that NHS staff did not have adequate PPE. As if the situation was in no way his responsibility. Bluster had given way to dissociation. In his head he is both the prime minister and not the prime minister. Schrödinger’s PM.Thereafter, his logic collapsed in on itself. Having promised 250,000 tests back in March, he now promised to double the health secretary’s still largely fictitious figure of 100,000 to 200,000 by the end of the month. Matt Hancock shook his head in disbelief at this. This was clearly the first he had heard of this. Here was yet another ad hoc commitment on which he would be hung out to dry.Boris concluded by saying he was sorry not to be able to announce what measures he may or may not be introducing to ease the lockdown to parliament this week. Mainly because he still hadn’t a clue what they might be. Kill the economy or kill the nation? Maybe he would have more data by the time he spoke to the nation on Sunday. Or maybe he wouldn’t.But he did promise someone from the government would make a statement to parliament some time next week. Though it probably wouldn’t be him as he had things to do, such as choosing a new colour scheme for the nursery, and he didn’t know if he could stand another punishment caress from Starmer so soon. Hancock again looked ashen faced. For the second time in as many minutes, he was being lined up as the patsy. Some guys get all the luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e988347fcbf42ba26feb50dbc19c0d91b0b46d38/0_60_4799_2880/master/4799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5933a133382c4d95844d2def936bc960","title":"finnish basic income pilot improved wellbeing study finds coronavirus","story":"First major study of scheme comes as economic toll of coronavirus prompts fresh interest in ideaEurope’s first national, government-backed basic income experiment did not do much to encourage recipients into work but did improve their mental wellbeing, confidence and life satisfaction, according to the first big study of a Finnish scheme that has attracted fresh interest in the coronavirus outbreak.“The basic income recipients were more satisfied with their lives and experienced less mental strain than the control group,” the study, by researchers at Helsinki University, concluded. “They also had a more positive perception of their economic welfare.”The study comes as the devastating economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis - including soaring unemployment worldwide - sparks renewed interest in basic income schemes. The pope suggested in his Easter address that “this may be the time to consider a universal basic wage”.The Spanish government said last month it aimed to roll out a basic income “as soon as possible” to about a million of the country’s poorest households, with the economic affairs minister, Nadia Calviño, saying the Socialist-led government hoped a universal basic income would become “a permanent instrument”.Finland’s two-year scheme, which ran in 2017 and 2018 and attracted widespread international interest, paid 2,000 randomly selected unemployed people across the country a regular monthly income of €560 (£490), with no obligation to seek a job and no reduction in their payment if they accepted one.Aimed primarily at seeing whether a guaranteed income might encourage people to take up often low-paid or temporary work without fear of losing benefits, the scheme was not strictly speaking a universal basic income trial because the recipients came from a restricted group and the payments were not enough to live on.But it was watched closely by other governments who see a basic income not only as a way to get more people into some form of work, but also as a route to reducing dependence on the state and cutting welfare costs. The idea has gained traction amid predictions that automation could threaten up to a third of current jobs.The researchers, who conducted 81 in-depth interviews with participants in the scheme, concluded that while there was significant ersity in their experiences, they were generally more satisfied with their lives and experienced less mental strain, depression, sadness and loneliness than the control group.The researchers also noted a mild positive effect on employment, particularly in certain categories, such as families with children, adding that participants also tended to score better on other measures of wellbeing, including greater feelings of autonomy, financial security, and confidence in the future.“Some people said the basic income had zero effect on their productivity, as there were still no jobs in the area they were trained for,” said Prof Helena Blomberg-Kroll, who led the study. “But others said that with the basic income they were prepared to take low-paying jobs they would otherwise have avoided.“Some said the basic income allowed them to go back to the life they had before they became unemployed, while others said it gave them the power to say no to low-paid insecure jobs, and thus increased their sense of autonomy.”The scheme also gave some participants “the possibility to try and live their dreams”, Blomberg-Kroll said. “Freelancers and artists and entrepreneurs had more positive views on the effects of the basic income, which some felt had created opportunities for them to start businesses.”It also encouraged some participants to get more involved in society, by undertaking voluntary work, for example. “Some found the guaranteed income increased the possibility for them to do things like providing informal care for their family or their neighbours,” said one of the researchers, Christian Kroll.“The security of the basic income allowed them to do more meaningful things, as they felt it legitimised this kind of care work. Many of the people who performed such unpaid activities during the two-year period referred to it as work.”Kroll said the results of the study could support arguments both for and against basic income. “But as we’ve all learned in the early part of 2020, insecurity is not a good way to live,” he said.“While basic income can’t solve all our health and societal problems, there is certainly a discussion to be had that it could be part of the solution in times of economic hardship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9261d312f0a39fa07481f3b03d53ac314b97b0c0/0_175_5377_3227/master/5377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=870c9e21776fbf83ac40b45ba2978d3d","title":"government gave national pupils food voucher contract to small company","story":"Contract valued at £234m was given to Edenred, a company with fewer than 150 staffThe UK government handed a contract to feed more than a million pupils eligible for free school meals to a company with fewer than 150 staff, which has set up a scheme accused of leaving children hungry and humiliating parents.The task, outsourced to French-owned Edenred under emergency power without a competitive tendering process, involves distributing food vouchers valued at up to £234m.The contract runs for up to three months, indicating that the Department for Education expected the firm to distribute the £15-a-week vouchers to the 1.3m children in England eligible for free school meals.Despite the fact that the vast scale of the challenge was indicated at the outset by the value of the contract, the scheme has been dogged by problems since it started in March.Parents of children who would usually receive free school meals, but are at home during the lockdown, are meant to be able to use vouchers provided by Edenred to buy food in shops.But the firm’s website was initially overwhelmed, leaving desperate parents unable to log on and provoking fury among headteachers, who urged the government to intervene.An investigation by Schools Week last month found that some parents phoned schools in tears after being made to wait two weeks for vouchers.The site was upgraded over Easter but a report by the BBC on Wednesday found that parents were arriving at the tills only to be left “humiliated” when supermarkets wouldn’t accept their vouchers.Companies House accounts show that the magnitude of the free meals contract dwarfs the company that was asked to manage it.Edenred’s French parent company, which manages employee benefits such as luncheon vouchers for businesses, had revenues of £1.4bn last year.But its much smaller UK subsidiary, Edenred (UK Group) Limited, which is managing the voucher scheme, reported revenues of less than £11.8m for the year ending 31 December 2018 and had just 145 employees.The contract did not go through the usual competitive tendering process due to “the emergency situation caused by Covid-19 pandemic”.The contract cites “a critical need to enable families the access to the free school meal replacement scheme”.Documents accompanying the contract state that “standard quality and price criteria are not applicable on this occasion”.In a statement on its website, Edenred said: “The new national voucher scheme to support the delivery of free school meals on behalf of the Department for Education has now provided over £58m of supermarket eGift cards to families and schools as of Tuesday 5 May.“The number of schools who have placed orders on the scheme has now grown to 16,500 schools.“Improvements made to the free school meal voucher site last weekend mean that parents and schools face short or no-time waiting time when ordering online, despite continued growth in the number of parents and schools using the scheme.”“We have now issued over 3.87m of £15 free school meal allowances to families and schools.”The contract was for an initial four weeks with an option to extend up to 12. They launched five weeks ago on 27 March, indicating that the Department of Education appears to have decided not to terminate it after the trial period. has approached Edenred for further comment.The Department for Education said: “Improvements have been made to Edenred’s technology system and we expect the company to continually improve to meet this unprecedented situation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f74187e44d6bcdcff4872e71f4ec46191db8151/0_27_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01164d47fb4027cebc8c7dab1edb4c5c","title":"brett favre no show speeches mississippi","story":"Former NFL quarterback Brett Favre is repaying $1.1m in welfare money that he received for multiple speeches where he did not show up, the Mississippi state auditor said Wednesday.Auditor Shad White said his office received $500,000 from Favre on Wednesday, plus a commitment that Favre will repay the other $600,000 in installments over the next few months.Favre’s effort to repay the money came two days after White released an audit of spending by the Mississippi department of human services that showed Favre had been paid by Mississippi Community Education Center, a non-profit group whose former leader has been indicted in a welfare embezzlement scheme.Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the US, and the community education center had contracts with Human Services to spend money through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, also known as TANF.“I want to applaud Mr Favre for his good faith effort to make this right and make the taxpayers and TANF families whole,” White said in a statement Wednesday. “To date, we have seen no records indicating Mr. Favre knew that TANF was the program that served as the source of the money he was paid.”The audit released Monday said the center paid Favre Enterprises $500,000 in December 2017 and $600,000 in June 2018, and he was supposed to make speeches for at least three events. The auditor’s report said that “upon a cursory review of those dates, auditors were able to determine that the inidual contracted did not speak nor was he present for those events.”Favre, who lives in Mississippi, faces no criminal charges. The audit report lists the payments to him as “questioned” costs, which White said means “auditors either saw clear misspending or could not verify the money had been lawfully spent”.In a Facebook post Wednesday night, Favre said he didn’t know the payments he received came from welfare funds and noted his charity had provided millions of dollars to poor kids in his home state of Mississippi and Wisconsin, where he played the bulk of his Hall of Fame career with the Green Bay Packers.“My agent is often approached by different products or brands for me to appear in one way or another. This request was no different, and I did numerous ads for Family First,” Favre wrote.“I have never received moneys for obligations I didn’t meet. To reiterate Auditors White’s statement, I was unaware that the money being dispensed was paid for out of funds not intended for that purpose, and because of that I am refunding the full amount back to the state of Mississippi.“I have spent my entire career helping children through Favre 4 Hope donating nearly $10m to underserved and underprivileged children in Mississippi and Wisconsin.“It has brought a ton of joy to my life, and I would certainly never do anything to take away from the children I have fought to help! I love Mississippi and I would never knowingly do anything to take away from those that need it most.”White said the money being repaid by Favre will be sent to the department of human services.Favre has not returned multiple text messages sent to him by the Associated Press since Monday. His manager, Bus Cook, told AP on Wednesday: “We’ve got nothing to say.”In an audit, White said his employees identified $94m in questionable spending by the agency, including payments for sports activities with no clear connection to helping needy people in one of the poorest states of the US.The audit was released months after a former human services director and five other people were indicted on state charges of embezzling about $4m. They have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial in what White has called one of Mississippi’s largest public corruption cases in decades.“If there was a way to misspend money, it seems DHS leadership or their grantees thought of it and tried it,” White said.John Davis was director of the Department of Human Services from January 2016 until July 2019, appointed by then-governor Phil Bryant – a Republican who also appointed White to office when a previous auditor stepped down. Davis was one of the people indicted another was Nancy New, who was director of the Mississippi Community Education Center. Davis, New and the others indicted have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.AP left a phone message Wednesday at Mississippi Community Education Center’s Jackson office with questions about the payments to Favre. There was no immediate response.The auditor’s report said Human Services leaders, particularly Davis, “participated in a widespread and pervasive conspiracy to circumvent internal controls, state law, and federal regulations” to direct grant money to certain people and groups. Davis instructed two groups that received grants, the Mississippi Community Education Center and Family Resource Center of North Mississippi, to spend money with certain other people or groups, the auditor’s report said.White said the those two nonprofit groups received more than $98m in Department of Human Services grants during the three years that ended 30 June. Most of the money came from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.The audit will be sent to the US department of health and human services, and federal officials will decide whether to sanction the state for misspending, White said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e475573c02227cb8dfeb060f9b60df91161b68f/84_0_3247_1950/master/3247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87e0242ec9beac54f7d6d17833ab1521","title":"independent review uk athetics demands change mo farah alberto salazar","story":"An independent review into UK Athletics has found the crisis-hit organisation “couldn’t get any worse” – and demanded changes to its structures, culture and ethical approach.Dame Sue Street, who led the review commissioned by UK Sport, says many of her 50 interviewees had “experienced poor behaviours within the sport and also referred to a general culture of mistrust”.Most strikingly, Street says that when it comes to certain grey areas in performance “UKA needs to transform the way that it approaches difficult ethical decisions … founded upon clear organisational values, beliefs and standards”.In February BBC’s Panorama revealed that four senior UK Athletics figures had debated whether giving Mo Farah four injections of the amino acid L-carnitine before he ran the 2014 London Marathon was ethical and in the “spirit of the sport”. Concerns have also been raised over whether legal thyroid medication may have been used to aid performance, something denied by UKA.The new UKA chief executive, Joanna Coates, recently admitted she was “concerned” by the Panorama report and pledged that ethics would take precedence over medals in future.Street also warns: “It is paramount that levels of authority in relation to decision-making on the ‘grey areas’ are crystal clear. Iniduals operating under pressure to deliver targets will find it difficult to maintain objectiveness. Therefore, a safe and independent centre for advice on these matters is required.”In the past few months UKA has also lost its former chairman Chris Clark and former chief executive Zara Hyde Peters, who failed to disclose her husband’s “inappropriate relationship” with a 15-year-old girl to her athletics club.UKA has also faced criticism over its relationship with Alberto Salazar, who was banned in October for doping offences, and failed to hit its medal target at the 2019 world championships.Street acknowledges there had been improvements recently under Coates and the new UKA chair, Nic Coward. However, she says “the scars inflicted as a result of the period of difficulty within athletics are clear to see”, adding: “The impression formed during the review was that athletics in the UK is not currently in a good position.”Part of Street’s package of reforms involves the UKA board opening up to representatives of the home countries along with improving its communication and digital strategies.However, the  understands that Street’s suggestion that the UKA members’ council could be disbanded has been met with horror by many given its vital role in scrutinising the board.Street also offers a veiled criticism of UK Sport, the body that oversees Olympic and Paralympic sports, saying in the past it had focused too much on medals and not scrutinised inidual sports closely enough. “It is important that UK Sport recognises situations in which it is appropriate to take a more interventionist approach.”The report was welcomed by Coward, who said: “It captures what we have heard very strongly from across the sport, that there is a need for change.”Meanwhile Sally Munday, the chief executive of UK Sport, said the review would help “tackle the “deep-rooted problems” in track and field. “We hope that this can mark the beginning of a new chapter for athletics in this country,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/994e0064395501366d07a5546fa8999b58d28818/28_0_1483_890/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43b75e448b98a29ebcae4236dc54bb43","title":"google sidewalk labs toronto smart city abandoned","story":"Sidewalk Labs’ CEO said unpredictabilities stemming from pandemic meant project was no longer feasibleGoogle’s affiliate Sidewalk Labs has abruptly abandoned its vision to transform Toronto’s waterfront into one of the world’s first “smart cities”.In a statement released on Thursday, Sidewalk Labs’ CEO, Dan Doctoroff, said that sustained unpredictabilities stemming from the coronavirus pandemic meant that the project was no longer feasible.“As unprecedented economic uncertainty has set in around the world and in the Toronto real estate market, it has become too difficult to make the 12-acre project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the plan we had developed,” he wrote.The sudden end to the Quayside project marks a stunning downfall to the vision championed by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Eric Schmidt of Google, of a community built “from the internet up”.Doctoroff nonetheless praised Toronto as “one of the world’s great centres of technological innovation” and said the decision came with “great personal sadness and disappointment”. In a sign of its commitment to the project, Sidewalk Labs had established an office in the city, as well as a team staffed by urban planners and public relations experts, he said.The project, which had become the target of fierce criticism from privacy advocates, envisioned a city that was “fundamentally more sustainable and affordable community resulting from innovations in technology and urban design”, said Doctoroff.In its sleek proposal in 2017, Sidewalk Labs touted “raincoats” for buildings, autonomous vehicles and cutting-edge wood-frame towers to make housing more affordable.But tensions quickly mounted when Sidewalk Labs scaled up its ambitions, pitching a plan to develop 190 acres of prime waterfront real estate – far larger than the agreed-upon 12 acres.As the project ran into delays and questions over taxation, a growing chorus of influential voices in the tech community expressed concern over the proposed smart city.“No matter what Google is offering, the value to Toronto cannot possibly approach the value your city is giving up,” the venture capitalist Roger McNamee wrote in a letter to the Toronto city council, pleading with officials to abandon the project. “It is a dystopian vision that has no place in a democratic society.”Two years ago, Jim Balsillie, the co-founder of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, called the project “a colonizing experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues”.Sidewalk Labs had previously said that any data collected wouldn’t be shared with third parties, instead advocating for a “data trust” to protect sensitive information.In September, Waterfront Toronto, the amalgam of city, provincial and federal representatives working on the project, called key aspects of the proposal “irrelevant”, “unnecessary” and “frustratingly abstract” in a report, despite the two sides eventually reaching an agreement to move forward.Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, said that while he regrets that Sidewalk Labs had abandoned Quayside, the departure represents a “tremendous new opportunity” to develop the former industrial lands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa293dee15c1e0d52ce302ce87406578fc24120a/0_64_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bff4d938f5bcd5ccaea1fdc13267d1f","title":"british tourism businesses post lockdown plans","story":"As the nation waits for details of the UK’s exit strategy, destinations are working on safe ways to manage visitors this summerIn the topsy-turvy world of lockdown, the message from the UK’s holiday hotspots this bank holiday weekend is the same as it was at Easter four weeks ago: stay away.However, behind the scenes tourism officials and hospitality bosses are busy working out how destinations will start to welcome back visitors this summer. Without knowing exactly what changes will be announced when Boris Johnson produces his roadmap on Sunday, tourist boards across the UK are setting out plans for a phased reopening of attractions and businesses as they endeavour to salvage some of the 2020 season. “We can’t afford to wait until lockdown’s over and find we’ve not got the plans in place,” said Gill Haigh, chief executive of Cumbria Tourism. “The question is how we reset.”It’s a big question. Discussions around what to open and when are taking place against a backdrop of huge public anxiety about coming out of lockdown. An Observer poll at the weekend found that the majority of people believe it’s too soon to ease restrictions, and local people are understandably furious with those do flout the current rules, as happened this week in the Lake District.The challenge for destinations is giving tourism the shot in the arm that it desperately needs while reassuring visitors, employees and residents that they will be safe. As a result of that delicate balancing act, holidaying in the UK this summer may well feel like we’ve time-travelled back to the 1950s, before the advent of affordable foreign travel: there will be day trips to beaches, parks and gardens we’ll be able to buy an ice-cream but won’t be dining in a crowded restaurant if it rains we won’t be sheltering in the nearest museum or indoor activity centre.Outdoor spaces in rural and coastal areas and attractions with large grounds will be the first to welcome visitors, not just because those are places where social distancing can be maintained but because, post-lockdown, people will be drawn to nature for its calming effects. “Our consumer research shows that people want to get back to simple pleasures,” said Kate Mavor, chief executive of English Heritage, which manages 400 historic sites in England. “People can come with a picnic and just enjoy being close to nature. There’s also great comfort in being in places that have stood the sense of time – that have survived war and pestilence. We will be a tonic for people when they come.”But even simple pleasures will be different post-lockdown. Pre-booking visits to heritage sites will become the new norm. One-way systems, extra signage, hand sanitiser stations and staff in PPE will be familiar sights as attractions strive to minimise risk to visitors and staff.“The challenge even with open spaces will be around security and making sure people are being sensible,” said Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Hertfordshire. “What people were used to beforehand will not happen now: just turning up at a National Trust place may not be possible.”This first phase of openings will be closely watched by tourist boards aware that recovery is dependent on the confidence of local communities. “If local people see that these attractions are acting responsibly, you’re warming them up to the idea of more visitors coming back by late summer and autumn,” said Jo Dilley of Marketing Peak District.Riddell Graham of Visit Scotland added: “We had a not particularly helpful situation early on when people were trying to get to islands to self-isolate. So no matter what we do, we have to take on board the community interest, particularly for more remote rural areas.”At the same time as reassuring communities that their safety is a priority, tourism officials will be pushing the value of visitors to the local economy. The impact of coronavirus on the 241,000 tourism businesses in the UK has been catastrophic. “You can’t underestimate how important the visitor economy is for an area like ours,” said Haigh of Cumbria Tourism. “If tourism isn’t allowed to return – and if the value of that tourism isn’t created, a lot of businesses won’t be here this time next year.”Of course the economic impact hasn’t just been on businesses. Financial pressures on iniduals will affect the recovery. Greg Stevenson, founder of cottage company Under the Thatch, said the company is receiving daily bookings for July and August – but mainly for more expensive properties. “It’s wealthier people who are booking five-star cottages.”He believes self-catering properties will be in the second tranche of openings. New procedures will be put in place, such as sterilising hard surfaces and providing antiseptic sprays, but he is sure there’s an appetite for holidays this summer. “I’ve got no doubt at all that there is demand for people to get away tomorrow.” Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six Pig hotels and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: “The worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the ‘perfect storm’ of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed … This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.”The letter, supported by many of the biggest names in the food and hotel trades, including Rick Stein, Mitch Tonks, Michael Caines and Gordon Campbell-Gray, called for a flexible, part-time furlough scheme until the end of the first quarter of 2021 and an extension of the business rates holiday until the second quarter. He is optimistic that hospitality will be considered when the Treasury announces details of the scaled-back scheme.Like hoteliers across the country, Hutson and his team are drawing up plans for post-lockdown operating. Measures being discussed include meeting guests at their car instead of at reception, express checkouts, two-hour slots for room cleaning, and even decorative screening between tables. “We’ve spent hours talking about what we’re going to do but without knowing the ground rules,” he said. “It’s terribly difficult to formulate a plan.”Such measures will reassure potential visitors, especially when a nationwide kite mark showing that businesses are complying with new guidelines comes into place, but Hutson fears they’ll also make the atmosphere strained: “People come to us for the social aspect – to hear the buzz of other people in the bar. That’s part of what we sell and if it doesn’t exist it’s going to be strange. The little bit of hope for our industry is that we will probably be among the last to be ‘released’. By then the population may have gained some confidence in moving around - that could help the mindset.” Despite Hutson’s fears for rural Britain, recovery will start sooner than in cities. Galleries, museums and other indoor attractions will be in the final tranche of openings in late summer or early autumn, although tourism officials hope to see some life return to cities if planning restrictions are relaxed to allow restaurants and bars to expand on to the streets. “In Sweden they have closed down streets and made them into dining and drinking areas in the evenings to increase floor space and bring food outside,” said Kurt Janson, director of Tourism Alliance, a consortium of 55 trade bodies in tourism and hospitality. “This summer we might look more continental.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac8508561328ecb3402c430efbcc9f0f4aeb0d7/0_262_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0a54b4e48cead8b7ed738a0bde43eb4","title":"my happy place readers travel tips","story":"Memories of beaches – in the UK or further afield – as well as village bars, sunrise views and days out with tea and cake are sustaining readers during lockdownA day out in Whitby. Morning tea and fruit cake with Wensleydale at Bothams. Walk to the sea, and out onto the pier. Walk up the beach, climb up the cliff and then back to the town past the whale’s jaw. Fresh crab sandwiches for lunch, then climb the 199 steps to the Priory. Back down, just enough time for afternoon tea and cake before crossing back over the river for a fish supper at the Magpie. Drive back over the beautiful North Yorkshire moors the end of a perfect day, in perfect weather every time.Nigel GoddardAt the end of Glen Etive, way past the lay-bys where the tourists pose for Skyfall photos and isolated from the single track road, lies Glenceitlein Cottage. Accessible from a two-mile rough track and sitting in a green pasture at the foot of Stob Dubh and overlooking the mighty Ben Starav. No TV, no internet, just the sound of the river, the cuckoo and the deer. There’s no place like it and I cannot wait to return.Paul WilsonMy happy place is Shell Bay in Dorset. I’m about eight. It’s always very warm and sunny as Dad would never make the short crossing from Sandbanks if there was any chance of cloud or rain. This place that we visited perhaps only once a year with its empty expanses of beach, backdrop of sand dunes, crystal clear sea with yachts in the distance, is magical in my memory. I also remember complaining about the long walk carrying beach paraphernalia around the headland to find a “better spot” and worrying I wouldn’t be able to find Mum and Dad again up in the dunes as I came back from the water’s edge. Oh yes and no ice cream!LizTucked away in the curve of the Pagasitic Gulf on the Greek mainland lies the port town of Volos where my husband and I lived and married 20 years ago and from where, according to myth, Jason and his Argonauts set sail. Following the coast road for 20km or so brings you to the western side of Mount Pelion and the village of Milies. Here, under the shade of an enormous plane tree, you can stare across the Aegean to the Sporades beyond and then, if it’s the weekend, take the narrow-gauge railway train called Old Sooty back down through the mountain to Volos after three too many ouzos. I visit often in my dreams. It’s a place where breathing slows. There’s nowhere like Pelion, mythical home of the centaurs, on earth.JoOur happy place is the bar in a small village, Mons La Trivalle, in Haut-Languedoc, southern France. Travelling there, through vineyards, cicadas in the background, and the Caroux mountains rearing up as we reach our destination, fills us with joy. As we enter the village there is a sharp bend and then in front of us is the bar Auberge du Caroux. There’s the table we will sit at, exchanging greetings with the owner and locals, drinking rosé or pastis, coffee on market days or lunch on Sundays, watching the world go by. • minervois-carouxTessa BucknellTranslating as Kissing Steps, this city-centre space epitomises Copenhagen’s inspired approach to urban design. It’s a deceptively simple layout of wide wooden steps leading down to the cleaned-up harbour, surrounded by containers which open into bars and a stage. In the brief summer, locals catch up with friends, sunbathe and swim in the brackish water, often straight from work. Sipping cocktails, listening to low-key DJ sets and egging each other on to jump into the harbour remains one of my favourite family holiday memories of recent years.NickArriving once more at the tiny bar at top of the walled village of Allerona, close to Orvieto, ordering the first drink and sitting at an outside rickety table is to know pure happiness. The view is down the steep village street, glorious with window box geraniums, or, to one side, through a stone archway to roll upon roll of Umbrian hills. Locals drop by to catch up over an espresso or beer – all greeting the newcomer. Few tourists make it here and, in winter, cold will permeate the stones but in my mind, arriving with endless blue skies, it’s perfection.Lin LeftleyI often revisit memories of lazy days at Da Adolfo – a mid-price beach restaurant a short hop from Positano main dock (look for the boat with the red fish sign). Da Adolfo is a local institution, its reputation earned not only for the seafood and homemade pasta but for the bubbling atmosphere. Tourists and locals sit elbow to elbow, the chatter building as more jugs of wine are consumed. Plates are passed down from the cliffside kitchen, waiters jogging barefoot over hot beach pebbles. I can think of no better way to spend an afternoon than flopping back on my lounger after a wonderful lunch, soaking up the sun and taking a dip. • daadolfoChloe BoothThe Turtle Islands, off the coast of Sierra Leone, are sublime, both scenically and culturally. A five-hour canoe ride leaves you entirely cut off from the rest of the world, and the welcoming people of the fishing villages will give you a glimpse of their daily lives. This is Nyangai, but the only guesthouse on the islands is on nearby Bakie. It was only recently opened by Isagah, who grew up there.Kevin PerryLast year for Vesak Day (the Buddhist national holiday) I finally hiked up Mount Bromo in East Java, Indonesia. The first day was spent hiking up Bromo’s crater and generally frolicking around Bromo national park’s moon-like landscape. On the second day we awoke at 2am to hike up Seruni Point, which is directly opposite Mount Bromo. After around an hour of hiking we found a spot to settle down, eat breakfast and wait for sunrise. Although we knew we had picked a good spot, it wasn’t until later that we really appreciated how lucky we were. This was the view that welcomed us when the sun came up. I doubt I will ever be anywhere again that can beat this.MelanieThe open door of a train on Indian railways... Sitting on the step and watching the landscape. Passing behind me and moving between carriages are chai sellers, food hawkers, buskers and beggars. Any train, second-class sleeper, just after sunrise or just before sunset. No prices, no website: just get yourself to India and book an overnight train somewhere.Nigel GommWho could be happier than a student, just finished year-end exams, going camping with his pals? My happy place is called Long Beach, a wide hard-packed beach on the open Pacific side of Vancouver Island. In the early 1970s, before it became part of Pacific Rim national park, you could drive on the beach and camp anywhere. It was an adventure to get there on logging roads through the mountains. The sound and sight of endless rollers coming in off the ocean, the salty breeze, the bald eagles, the camp fires and starry nights, the purity and isolation shared with friends ... although I live far away, that place will always be my spiritual home.

But that didn’t stop Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, from shooting straight at Axl Rose yesterday.The Guns N’ Roses frontman (real name William Bruce Rose Jr) has recently aired his frustrations on Twitter about the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus. But this time, Rose engaged in a simple bit of name-calling.To be fair to Mnuchin, the name-calling seemed pretty uncalled for. It’s been at least three days since Mnuchin did something stupid (like encourage US citizens to start traveling domestically during a pandemic) and at least a decade since he practically caused the financial crash.Mnuchin responded by asking Rose: “What have you done for this country lately?” Which would have been ironic enough on its own – seeing as Mnuchin is one of the people at the helm of an administration that has seen almost a quarter of the global deaths come from the US during this pandemic.But to make matters worse, Mnuchin accidentally ended his tweet with a Liberian flag emoji instead of the American flag.Now, the Trump administration has been having a hard time recently – just yesterday, Trump walked around a mask-manufacturing plant without a mask on, while Guns N’ Roses’ cover of Wings’ Live and Let Die blared out in the background.It was also reportedly Mnuchin’s idea to delay stimulus checks to millions of Americans because he wanted to get Trump’s signature sprawled on all them before they were sent out. So maybe mixing up flags isn’t the worst thing he’s done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f949561c77ec169dc08caa4ab2c5cb5834521a4/0_114_3443_2067/master/3443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6712783c6f398551bc6c8ba29bf0acd","title":"florida grim reaper beach interview","story":"Lawyer Daniel Uhlfelder explains why he protested against the reopening of beaches – and that his costume is actually made out of linenTimes are truly strange when a man dressed in a grim reaper’s costume in 90F (32C) heat is the most sane person around. But last week, as people flocked to Florida’s recently reopened beaches, Daniel Uhlfelder had a message for beachgoers.“The grim reaper represents death. This is a deadly virus. It’s a global pandemic,” he said in a televised news broadcast.It’s not in Uhlfelder’s nature to want to keep beaches closed – as a lawyer, he has campaigned to keep beaches publicly accessible in the past. But as the coronavirus death toll reaches 75,000 in the US and global shutdowns help to slow the spread of the deadly virus, Uhlfelder felt he had to say something.And so, he came up with an idea to dress up with a cloak and scythe, and take a Grim Reaper tour of Florida’s beaches.The protest has garnered national attention: Uhlfelder has appeared on Saturday Night Live, the Daily Show and CNN, and has raised thousands of dollars, which he will donate to Democrats who run for Congress.But when he came up with the idea, his wife warned him not to do it. He was even told by people online not to partake in the stunt – some laughed and wished heatstroke upon him. In the end, their unkind words turned out to be pretty useful.“I thought, maybe they have a point,” he says. And so, Uhlfelder took heed of his enemies’ advice and swapped out the $20 Walmart costume he originally intended to wear and called a friend to see if she might have something better.Needless to say, the experience was not entirely pleasant. Uhlfelder says he was heckled on the beach: people took photos of him, called him a jerk and some other, more unpleasant names too.Still, Uhlfelder says the comments don’t bother him – in fact, he’s not even particularly mad at the beachgoers. Uhlfelder empathizes with people who want the economy to reopen and life to go back to normal – particularly when the president doesn’t take shutdown seriously.“We have beautiful beaches, I’d love to go to the beach – that’s why people come to Florida. We don’t have anything else,” he jokes. But he asks why the US has made the offer of staying at home so unappealing for ordinary Americans.“We are the wealthiest country on the planet. Why can’t we have people taken care of for two, three, four months, instead of being put in these situations? They are perfectly comfortable starving out or killing people,” he says.Most people have reacted positively to the stunt – and Uhlfelder says he is happy that his dry sense of humor has cut through in landscape when some of the loudest voices have been anti-shutdown protesters carrying guns. He just hopes his protest empowers others to do the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Yet their disappointment is tempered by the same stoicism that got them through the war.“I can’t tell you how disappointed I am,” said Marie Scott, 93, who as a 17-year-old wireless operator heard first-hand the “bombs, gunfire, shouting and mayhem” of the D-day landings over the telephone in Portsmouth. “But in the present circumstances I think: what am I moaning about? All I’ve got is disappointment, whereas a lot of people have got far, far worse.”Scott, a retired secretary and grandmother, should have been in the Netherlands this week with the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, marking Dutch Freedom day with others. There was to have been a parade, too, in central London, and a service at Westminster Abbey, followed by afternoon tea in a hotel and a meeting with old comrades, she said.She joined the million-strong crowd in central London on VE Day “where you were swept up with this sense of excitement and exhilaration”. “There was lots of hugging and kissing, all totally indiscriminate”. She remembers being alarmed by the density of the crowd, and fearful of being crushed.Now, on Friday, “I will probably be alone,” she said, “ though there will be masses of phone calls, and I’ve got my tiny little union jack.” At the end of the two minutes silence, at her flat near New Malden, south-west London, she intends to “raise a glass of something pleasant”.Ron Johnson, 98, from Shrivenham, near Swindon, was also expecting to be in Wageningen, in the Netherlands, with the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, where he and other veterans would have be cheered by tens of thousands on Freedom Day. The retired businessman and grandfather has been before, “and it’s the most terrific experience, with people coming up to shake your hands.”“But, it’s gone. Kaput. It’s completely understandable. The world has shut down because of this virus,” said Johnson, an infantry officer with the Essex Regiment, then a glider pilot, who survived the bloody Battle of Arnhem despite being wounded by mortar fire and hit by a sniper’s bullet.Taken prisoner, he spent six months on a near starvation diet at Spangenberg Castle camp, then escaped when the Germans marched them out, and hid in hills for eight days until he was picked up by Americans. He arrived home in Grays, Essex, two days before VE Day.“On VE Day I got dressed up in service dress and headed into London, feeling smart though a bit thin and worn through lack of food.” He headed to Buckingham Palace, then he and two comrades went to a pub, in the company of “three young ladies from Scotland”.He thinks he will spend the anniversary mainly alone, although his daughter will visit. “And I shall be thinking chiefly about the terrible loss at Arnhem, which was really shocking, but not to dwell on it or to be too sad,” he said. He hopes to visit the Netherlands again in the future. “But, I’m 98 now, and it might have been my last opportunity.”Jim Healy, 95, a D-day veteran, missed VE Day as he was onboard HMS Persimmon in Bombay’s docks, preparing to head to Burma and “have a go at the Japanese”.“It was half-time for us,” said Healy, a former Royal Marine and retired printer from Middleton, Manchester, who lives alone.“The announcement came over the tannoy from the prime minister that they’d surrendered. It was quite joyful, to say the least.” They had to wait until the following day for their rum ration, “then it was quite a noisy party, but we were brought down to earth very rapidly because we were preparing for Burma.”He was to have been in London on Friday for the Royal British Legion celebrations and parade. Instead, his family will pay a distanced garden visit, and he plans to join the national singalong of We’ll Meet Again.“It would have been a joyful day. We missed the celebrations on VE Day, but saw pictures of people going mad in Manchester, London and Liverpool. I was looking forward to the anniversary. It would make up for what we missed when we were in India,” he said.For Jack Bracewell, 97, VE Day was spent in Schleswig-Holstein, in northern Germany. The following day, while visiting the house of a German family he had befriended, the door opened and the couple’s son entered in German uniform. No longer enemies, the two men shared “several drinks”. “It was over. And he was just another soldier,” recalled Bracewell, a D-day driver with the Royal Armoured Service Corps who experienced heavy fighting in Caen and at the Battle of Falaise.The retired driver, from Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, had hoped to attend three days of celebrations in London organised by the Royal British Legion. But his daughter and her husband, with whom he lives, are still pulling out all the stops.There will be bunting, bubbly, afternoon tea on the front lawn and 1940s music. Bracewell intends to wear a union jack sequinned bow tie. And though he can’t see his old comrades in the flesh, they will catch up on the day through video calls. “I’d love to have seen them. We were brothers. But, we can’t risk it with this virus,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=377b7e9952a8b143333fc91bc5ca5998","title":"coronavirus part of new normality says german agency as briefings cease","story":"Robert Koch Institute says approach now is to ‘learn to live with the virus and control it’Germany will have to learn to live with the coronavirus, building tactics such as physical distancing and strict hygiene into normal daily life, the country’s leading public health institution has said as it wound up its regular press briefings on the pandemic as a result of a continued fall in new infections.Lars Schaade, the vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute, said that as Germany’s infection rate had been “substantially pushed back”, the decision to drop its briefing – which has attracted millions of viewers since it began in February, firstly daily and later twice weekly – marked a “new phase”.“The epidemic is of course not over,” he said. “But having substantially pushed the virus back so that the number of new cases are between 600 and 1,300 a day … our approach now has to be to learn to live with the virus and to control it.”Journalists attending the briefing strongly voiced their opposition to the briefing being scrapped. It has provided the public and media with detailed information on Germany’s infection rates, up-to-date information on the virus’s development, and explanations on preventive measures and the science behind public health decisions, free of any political colouring.Schaade said the media could continue to put questions to the institute’s press department and there would be press conferences in the event of significant developments.Germany has had 166,091 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Thursday, according to figures registered with the RKI, an increase of 1,284 since Wednesday. There were concerns that the numbers of new cases were increasing, but Schaade insisted they reflected the normal development on a weekly basis, with higher numbers often registered on Wednesdays and Thursdays.The country’s reproduction or R rate has fallen to 0.65, meaning that on average every 10 infected people are infecting between six and seven others.Schaade said he expected the pandemic to last for many more months, and most likely into next year. “It’s clear this virus cannot be eradicated in Germany. There’s consensus on that – at least until there’s a vaccine or a treatment. We will have to try to build this virus into our everyday lives, changing our behaviour to reduce its transmission. We find ourselves in a new normality.”He said tackling the virus required each person to take responsibility for his or her own behaviour. “Only then can we control the virus and lead an appropriate life as a society.” On Wednesday the leaders of Germany’s 16 states agreed to put the onus on regional public health authorities to monitor the virus’s progress and instigate emergency measures if infections start to rise. If the rate of new infections in a municipality exceeds 50 per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days, communities will be swiftly forced into lockdown, including the closure of schools and shops. Schaade called the measure a “pragmatic safety limit”.There is considerable nervousness in Germany over decisions to allow all shops to open and schools to return. Angela Merkel called the decision to come out of lockdown “brave”, stressing the risk that Germany could quickly lose the advantage it has gained over the spread of the virus. “We have to be careful that this thing doesn’t slip from our grasp,” she said on Wednesday.The chancellor has been accused by some political parties of acting too late to save the economy, while some virologists say the measures go too far too soon. The effects of the relaxation of rules are expected to be visible in infection rates around two to three weeks after their implementation.Schaade said testing and tracing remained essential to tackling the virus. Although Germany has maintained a capacity to carry out 964,000 tests a week, only 317,000 tests were carried out last week. Schaade said this was a reflection of the fact that the number of infections had fallen, but owing to a global shortage of items such as reagents “it is not bad to have a certain remaining capacity” in expectation of a second wave.

There is no indication that Putin has been infected with the virus.“This was supposed to be a grandiose political show,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst and former Kremlin adviser. “They had portrayed this as the central political event of this year, a culmination of his two decades in power. And none of it has gone as planned.”Russia has the highest growth rate of infections in Europe and as of Thursday has the fifth highest number of cases in the world, surpassing Germany and France. Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, and two other cabinet members have fallen ill. In discussions with his subordinates, Putin at times has looked deeply bored. As his health minister discussed regional payouts on Wednesday, the president distractedly rolled a pen back and forth across his desk, lost in a moment of reverie broadcast nationwide.“Putin not only doesn’t control the situation but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,” said Nikolay Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British thinktank Chatham House. “He cannot adjust … I think partly Putin’s lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position.”He has sought to regain the initiative by holding televised briefings and promising economic stimulus to Russians hit by the economic downturn, while soliciting timetables for business to reopen. But the measures have been underwhelming and the virus’s long horizon has meant Putin takes a back seat while local officials – such as Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin – lead the fight against the virus.“Putin wants to become a ladder out of the crisis: Sobyanin makes rules and Putin will cancel them that’s a positive role,” noted Pavlovsky. “But there’s no way out of this crisis, this pandemic, yet. Things are still getting worse and more dangerous.”The Kremlin’s desire to carry out its political programme has appeared at odds with its response to the epidemic. Putin held off on cancelling the symbolic vote until late March and the Victory Day parade until mid-April, with thousands of soldiers being sent into quarantine as a preventive measure.“It appears the Kremlin was too focused on the constitutional and political reforms and not the epidemic,” said Petrov. “The epidemic came later to Russia and it was possible to be better prepared.”One thing is clear: this is not the time to hold a public vote that could backfire over the Kremlin’s response to the epidemic. Analysts have suggested that it could be cancelled entirely, or delayed until the autumn when political conditions are more favourable.State television serves as a window on what could have been. On Sunday the lead segment on Channel One’s flagship news programme, Vremya, was not an update on the country’s battle with the virus but a 13-minute report marking 20 years since Putin’s first inauguration on 7 May 2000. It felt like a time capsule from before the epidemic.“The very existence of the country was under threat,” read Yekaterina Andreyeva, the well-known anchor. “Over two decades, Russia has once again become a strong country that is once again reckoned with in the world and which is able to solve the hardest problems and overcome any obstacles.”But the Kremlin does closely follow its polling numbers, which have shown two years of sliding approval for Putin, mainly due to the economy. And the loss of this spring’s political calendar has robbed the Kremlin of a chance to recharge his image as he begins a third decade in power.“People aren’t so scared of coronavirus as its economic consequences, salaries, redundancies,” said Denis Volkov, the deputy director of the Levada Centre. “And secondly, it is exhaustion with Putin himself … there are no expectations of anything new from him.”The next stage of the crisis will take place as the scale of the epidemic becomes clear in Russia’s regions, indicating whether Russia may be looking at an extended health crisis and how much longer the economy will remain shuttered. Already, a number of coronavirus hotspots have appeared at far-flung oil and gas fields and at regional hospitals.“The whole management system looks inefficient,” said Petrov. “The regions are far less prepared in general to face the crisis than Moscow … I am afraid that they will suffer more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/581c28adf2b0842f8eb6468c5dd254dcc2e4ae26/0_156_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9bc6314dd71d3eb4e87229a041a26f1","title":"egyptologists pan transfer of sphinxes to tahrir square","story":"Site will expose sphinxes to air pollution and obscure Egypt’s recent protest history, say criticsThe transfer of four sandstone sphinxes to Tahrir Square in Cairo will expose them to intense heat and air pollution and amounts to an attempt to erase Egypt’s recent history, Egyptologists and academics have said.Officials from Egypt’s antiquities ministry recently announced that the ram-headed sphinxes had been taken from the Karnak temple in Luxor to the capital’s busy traffic roundabout, where they have joined a pink granite obelisk. The sphinxes are being stored in wooden crates until an unveiling ceremony, for which a date has not been set.“When we go to European capitals, like Rome or Paris or London, and also Washington, we see that they use Egyptian obelisks in decorating their major tourist squares, so why do we not do the same?” Khaled El-Enany, Egypt’s minister of antiquities, told Al Ahram newspaper. The 90-tonne obelisk from the period of Ramses II, which was moved to Tahir Square in 2019, will be mounted high to “give it historical value” and attract tourists, he added.The square, one of Cairo’s busiest traffic intersections, is also a symbolic protest site. Tahrir, meaning liberation, was at the centre of the 2011 uprising that toppled the autocratic president Hosni Mubarak. It became a meeting place for millions of Egyptians who fought security forces for control of the city centre.In the years since 2013, when a military coup brought the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to power, the square retained its symbolism despite a widespread crackdown on opposition and a de facto ban on protests. A move by the government in 2013 to erect a memorial there to the almost 900 people killed in the 2011 uprising brought scorn from activists, who threatened to destroy it. A small spate of protests last year triggered a full lockdown of the square and the surrounding area by Egyptian security forces, in a show of force intended to curb any fresh uprising.Rabab El Mahdi, associate professor of political science at the American University in Cairo, said the monument represented the authorities’ efforts to erase contemporary history.“It covers over the recent memory that is alive in the minds of many people, with something historical that has no political connotations or significance,” she said.The installation will cap years of government efforts to remove traces in downtown Cairo of the 2011 uprising. Political murals and graffiti have been erased, and a parking garage built so that the entrance covers a corner of Tahrir Square.Mahdi said siting the sphinxes there was in bad taste. “It’s basically no respect for the living who witnessed this revolution and see it as part of contemporary history, and no respect for the dead, including the antiquities.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e79b63ac299dc684da3e7a4b29c843992c1afb7/21_43_3939_2365/master/3939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12736dbe0844c436a1e28c90fa878057","title":"i finished it veterans recall moment peace came to europe ve day 75 years","story":"US radio operator who sent news of German surrender among war generation marking VE Day 75 years onby  Daniel Boffey,  Kim Willsher ,  Angela Giuffrida and  Philip Oltermann“I finished it,” says Gregory Melikian, 97, “but my heroes are the guys that hit the beaches, so many of whom never came back.”Seventy-five years ago, in the early hours of 7 May 1945, the supreme allied commander Gen Dwight Eisenhower selected Sgt Melikian, then a 20-year-old radio operator, to send the coded message to army groups and allied capitals announcing Germany’s unconditional surrender.Of the three operators working in the Reims school that housed the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, Melikian was the youngest, an enlisted Illinois University student shipped to France just the year before, and that made him first choice for the US general.“I immediately had one of the lieutenants in the decodification room translate it for me. We were all expecting it any day and had been taking bets.”Three-quarters of a century later, and wearing a medical mask and protective clothing, Melikian was flown on Thursday in an empty plane from his home in Phoenix, Arizona, to Washington with the help of the Greatest Generation Foundation, a charity for veterans.Melikian is to be Donald Trump’s guest of honour at the White House on Friday. “He wants to make a big deal of the victory – which is his prerogative,” Melikian says. “Whether we like him or not, he is the one and only president, and we have one at a time.”The US veteran will represent a dwindling generation with direct memories of the second world war, many of whom are now trapped because of the coronavirus pandemic in their houses, apartments, care homes and hospitals on what is likely to be the last great anniversary of their lifetimes.Among them are Jean Thouvenin, 93, who was 13 when the war started in 1939. He enlisted on 2 November 1944, the day after his 18th birthday against the wishes of his parents, joining the 1st Army (France) as part of a medical battalion of stretcher carriers “picking up the dead and wounded”.VE Day in 1945 was spent in a Tyrolean village, about 25 miles from Innsbruck. “It was spring and a beautiful day,” says Thouvenin. “I had an accordion and the officers came to get me to play in the local chateau. I played all night. We partied all night. I was completely drunk – we were all completely drunk.“This year I will spend 8 May at home. It’s hard. This is my day of celebration and memory.”The same will be true of André Hissink, 100, who escaped to Britain from his native Netherlands in 1940 on HMS Keith as the Germans stormed through the Netherlands and Belgium.A pilot and navigator on 69 bombing missions for the No 320 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF over occupied Europe, providing close air support for ground forces on D Day, his memories of the fighting – and the moment of peace – are crystal clear.“They were just dots below us on the beaches – some moving and others not,” Hissink says of D-day, speaking from his home in Perth, Ontario, Canada.“I was on our base in Brussels when we heard of victory in Europe and we did something we shouldn’t. As officers we had pistols and fired them in the air. The military police were there in second: ‘You can’t do that sirs.’ We promised not to do it again.”Harry Shindler, 99, a British veteran of the Battle of Anzio and the liberation of Rome, will also be at home with his memories, in Italy where he has lived since 1982.“There are very few of us left now I’m told I’m the last of those who landed at Anzio in 1944,” says Shindler, who hopes to properly mark the moment peace was won when lockdowns across Europe are lifted. “Things being what they are now, of course, we really are restricted on movements. It is an important day for us and for everybody, and it’s good that people still remember.”The 8th of May is known in Germany as the Tag der Befreiung, or Day of Liberation. For the 75th anniversary, Berlin has declared the day a holiday, but those planning to mark it have had to change their plans. Claus Günther, born 1931, spent the day 75 years ago hiding in a monastery in remote Bavaria, having been evacuated from his Hamburg home under the Nazi regime’s child evacuation scheme.A member of the Hitler Youth, the then 14-year-old was only informed about Germany’s defeat by a commander three days later, and he remembers being secretly relieved.“There was a weight off my heart because I wouldn’t have to do military service,” Günther says. “But I was so steeped in the Nazi party, I could barely remember how to greet people without saying ‘Heil Hitler’.”Shindler says: “This war we had, people forget this … wars normally have been wars for empires or pieces for land this was a war really against what Churchill called the most horrendous regime there had ever been in the world. This was a war against evil.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16b941d5125fdc034d5d0b60aeccafe5574cf82/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf467116d37ca8783491e2830c8d308","title":"mexico beer shortage coronavirus","story":"Deemed ‘non-essential’, brewing was halted more than a month ago, leading to a thriving black marketMexicans sheltering in place during the Covid-19 crisis have endured crowded quarters and rising temperatures. Now they’re enduring another challenge: a nationwide beer drought.Beer production in Mexico was halted more than a month ago as health officials declared brewing a “non-essential” activity.Since then, the country’s stockpile has dwindled, fueling a robust black market in which speculators are demanding more than twice the pre-pandemic price.“We’re not producing a single beer,” Karla Siquieiros, president of Cerverceros de México, told the newspaper el Universal.But some beer-makers have continued their operations. The country is the largest beer exporter in the world, and Constellation Brands – which produces Modelo, Corona and Pacifico in Mexico for US markets – is still brewing for export.Oxxo, Mexico’s ubiquitous corner store chain, warned in late April that its beer supply would last just 10 days, prompting panic buying and long lines outside stores.Mexicans have greeted the domestic beer shortage with more bemusement than anger. Hashtags like #LaÚltimaChela (the last beer) trended on Twitter, while users posted pictures of empty fridges.But retailers say the loss of sales is seriously harming their livelihoods in an economy that is already tough.“Mexicans like to drink beer,” said Cuauhtémoc Rivera, director the National Alliance of Small Merchants, Anpec, which represents thousands of mom-and-pop stores.“This is a big money-maker for small stores,” said Rivera.Anpec had lobbied for brewing to be declared an essential activity, arguing that it would help people cope with coronavirus lockdowns.“States of anxiety, desperation and fears that could end in episodes of irascibility and intolerance” were inevitable during quarantine, the organisation argued, adding: “The consumption of beer at home operates as relaxant, which helps with enduring a difficult trial.”Many municipalities have banned the sale of alcohol for the duration of Covid-19 quarantines. Some analysts say that such measures can help reduce domestic violence – at a time when domestic abuse under lockdown is on rise around the world.But others said such laws conform to a familiar pattern in which Mexican authorities feel the need to take action – any action – in times of crisis.“Lots of authority figures love it,” said Xavier Tello, a healthcare consultant. “The authorities can show that they’re acting like authorities by imposing dry laws … as if it solved anything.”As temperatures climb, some beer drinkers continue to hunt for Mexico’s last few beers. But it can be a frustrating pursuit.Last weekend, Johnny, an engineer in the border city of Reynosa, visited eight stores in three neighbourhoods but came away empty-handed.“There is absolutely nothing,” he said of the stores in Reynosa. “There’s liquor, but not everybody wants that. And it’s dwindling too.”He did find beer for sale on the black market, but the asking price was triple the normal.In the end, Johnny crossed the border to buy a six-pack of Corona in Texas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdd248a63029286ccf67d9216f79ccfbb9c2111a/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6f74de32f4e8d21b719f2558796ba5fc","title":"scotland may slightly ease lockdown to allow more daily exercise","story":"Nicola Sturgeon says there are concerns about unrest if England relaxes rules soonerNicola Sturgeon has said she could agree to the slight easing of Scotland’s lockdown from Monday but has rejected any significant relaxation of the rules.The first minister said on Thursday the only relaxation she would consider would be allowing people to exercise outdoors more than once a day from next week, but only if the scientific advice justified it.She said there were concerns about public unrest in Scotland if Boris Johnson decided to relax England’s lockdown rules more quickly, after reports that ministers in London were considering allowing people to play golf, take picnics, take unlimited exercise and visit outdoor cafes from next week.Speaking after Sturgeon had a teleconference with the prime minister and other devolved leaders on Thursday afternoon, Sturgeon’s spokesman said she warned Johnson the Scottish lockdown would remain in force next week.“The only issue under consideration at this time was in relation to outdoor exercise,” her spokesman said. “The first minister also made clear that the ‘stay at home’ message remained crucial.”Despite criticism from both Edinburgh and Cardiff that he had failed to consult them about his plans to relax the lockdown from Monday, Johnson did not share any details of his plans in Thursday’s call but he indicated he would host another teleconference this weekend, before an expected Cobra meeting on Sunday.There were signs on Thursday that Downing Street was drawing back on reports overnight, attributed to UK government sources, that the prime minister would support greater outdoor activities. Officials at No 10 said there would be “maximum caution” about the extent to which the lockdown was eased.Sturgeon said her government was “constantly” talking to Police Scotland about public order the force has said its data shows a high level of compliance with the strict lockdown regulations, but by late April 78 people had been arrested and there had been more than 7,800 alleged breaches of the lockdown.“As these messages over time become more nuanced, then the issues around enforcement become, potentially, much more difficult,” Sturgeon said.Sturgeon said she was opposed to any significant easing of the lockdown rules, and warned against the UK’s devolved nations being pressurised into adopting lighter regulations before it was safe to do so.She said it seemed that Scotland’s current rate of community transmission, the so-called R number, was hovering around 1. She said Scotland was still a few weeks behind England in the infection curve. That needed to be far lower before the regulations were greatly eased, she said.“Any significant easing up of restrictions at this stage could be very, very risky indeed,” she said. “All that tells me is that extreme caution is required at this critical juncture.”Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.While another 59 people died in hospital in Scotland over the last 24 hours, the numbers in hospital fell again by 45 to 1,587, and the numbers in intensive care were also down, by three to 86. She said Scotland was at a “pivotal point” and the worst result of any easing would be seeing cases suddenly surge again.Earlier on Thursday, Sir Harry Burns, Scotland’s former chief medical officer, told MSPs he was very “leery” about easing the lockdown before the R rate was below 0.5 because of the clear risk it would lead to a fresh surge in cases.Sturgeon’s cautious approach was also backed by Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, on a visit to Scotland. Starmer said it was essential all four parts of the UK took the same approach.“The danger if we don’t act together is that there are then different rules for different places, that makes it much more difficult to police.” It was “very hard to see how you could have separate regimes in different countries or regions”, he added.Iain Livingstone, Scotland’s chief constable, told the Scottish Police Authority, his force’s supervisory body, last week that having different lockdown rules in force in different places would present challenges for policing.He said it could put public consent under strain but insisted his force would cope. “I do think it will be difficult and it will be more nuanced than we’ve seen in the early weeks, which have proved challenging but the service has stood up to that,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c561db998061a124233fb88421f9cdf7ba93a749/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7376e88a4e48a3d62e2391fb38e14fd5","title":"uk newspapers accused of giving mixed messages on coronavirus lockdown","story":"Downing Street pours cold water on reports lockdown could be lifted from MondayBoris Johnson told his cabinet on Thursday he would operate with “maximum caution” as he prepares to update the country on the lockdown on Sunday, amid concern in government about confused messaging.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “Cabinet discussed where we are in the response to the coronavirus pandemic and the review which is being conducted into social distancing measures.“The prime minister said that in considering whether there could be any easement to the existing guidelines, we are not going to do anything that risks a second peak. We will advance with maximum caution in order to protect the NHS and to save lives.”Downing Street was keen to pour cold water on reports that the lockdown could be lifted from Monday, after newspaper headlines such as Lockdown Freedom Beckons and Happy Monday.Senior government figures privately expressed concern about what one referred to as “over-egged” reports about both the “tone and the pace” of a potential easing.The same source also played down one report that people could be able to sit two metres away from friends outside as soon as Monday. “It will be much more cautious than what is being reported,” they said.Following a meeting of the Welsh cabinet, a spokesman said: “It is crucially important that the people of Wales are informed clearly and accurately about what, if any, changes are made to the current stay-at-home restrictions.“Some of the reporting in today’s newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK. The first minister of Wales will announce the outcome of the cabinet’s decision in due course.”Asked at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday about lifting restrictions, Boris Johnson told MPs he wanted to “get going with some of these measures on Monday”.Government sources later said he had not meant to signal a major change – but hinted rules limiting exercise could be relaxed from Monday, and activities such as picnics and sunbathing allowed, so long as social distancing could be observed.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, cautioned against interpreting the reports as a signal that people could spend the long weekend soaking up the sunshine.“I want to make a direct appeal to Londoners as we start the bank holiday weekend. We’ve all made monumental efforts to follow the rules and stay at home over the last few weeks, and it is essential this continues over the coming days,” he said.“Despite the warm weather our priority first and foremost must still be the welfare of our loved ones and our key workers. Londoners have shown that they want to do everything they can to slow the spread of this virus, and we must all continue to follow the clear rules put in place to save lives.”Downing Street is still honing the message for Johnson’s broadcast on Sunday night, but government Twitter accounts began sharing a “stay safe, save lives” message – more nuanced than the stark “stay at home, save lives” of recent weeks.The lockdown is officially due to be reviewed on Thursday, six weeks after the emergency legislation was passed giving police the powers to enforce it.The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, is expected to confirm at the daily press conference that the review has taken place, but details about what comes next are expected to be left until Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa96924773bdb2c5ff2f45258986277e857b1b6/0_264_2941_1764/master/2941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30d3178d389ed3a231bbd83697f8bad4","title":"ve day 75 timetable prince charles to lead event with two minute silence","story":"Prince will read from George VI’s diary followed by doorstep singalong, Churchill speech and Captain Tom documentaryThe Prince of Wales is to lead the nation’s two-minute silence to mark the 75th anniversary of the ending of the second world war in Europe.Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will pay their respects from Scotland at 11am on a day of celebration and commemoration that also includes an address by the Queen and a national singalong of the wartime classic We’ll Meet Again.Charles will later read extracts from the diary of his grandfather, George VI, written on 8 May 1945, to be broadcast on BBC One during the afternoon.

It involved 950 officials from central and local government, NHS organisations, prisons and local emergency response planners. A report on the exercise was compiled the following year and distributed among its participants.The scenario imagined that a new virus had emerged in Thailand in June, later identified as a strain of H2N2. Within a month the World Health Organization had declared a public emergency, triggering the UK’s response plans as the world mobilised to tackle an outbreak of “swan flu”.For the three days of the exercise, officials were told to imagine they were managing the seventh week of the pandemic, facing a peak in demand for hospital and social care. The purpose of such simulations is generally not only to test how emergency plans would hold up under strain but also to acclimatise ministers and officials to the sorts of decisions they would be forced to make.Mock Cobra meetings were held where ministers and officials were presented with situation reports from the ground, while reporters from a fictitious news organisation called WNN published news articles, and government social media campaigns were released on “Twister”.The Cygnus report was frank about the state of the UK’s readiness. “The UK’s preparedness and response, in terms of its plans, policies and capability, is currently not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic that will have a nationwide impact across all sectors,” it found.One problem was that while each government body participating in the exercise had its own bespoke plans, enabling a flexible and decentralised response, nobody in the centre had oversight over everyone else.In the absence of any “overview of pandemic response plans and procedures”, participants found it much harder to shift resources between one another so as react to unexpected rises and falls in demand for services such social care beds.In the language of the report: “The lack of joint tactical level plans was evidenced when the scenario demand for services outstripped the capacity of local responders, in the areas of excess deaths, social care and the NHS.”Some organisations’ plans were severely out of date and sometimes referred to coordinating their response with bodies that no longer existed. Others were relying on an institutional memory of fighting the 2009 swine flu pandemic that was slowly fading.Social care appears to have been of particular concern. Participants discovered it was extremely difficult to locate capacity in the care homes sector, partly because care homes are almost entirely privately run, making it difficult to clear hospital beds by moving patients into care homes.“Local responders also raised concerns about the expectation that the social care system would be able to provide the level of support needed if the NHS implemented its proposed reverse triage plans, which would entail the movement of patients from hospitals into social care facilities,” the report said.Cygnus found that the social care sector was “currently under significant pressure during business as usual,” and that in the event of a pandemic staff absenteeism through illness combined with widespread infection of the vulnerable “could be very challenging”.The report lists four areas of “key learning” and 22 further “lessons identified” from the exercise, couched as recommendations to government. While some, such as those concerning the distribution of antivirals, are not relevant to a coronavirus pandemic, others are.The recommendations include further modelling to understand the capacity of the care sector, further work to understand how the public would react to the crisis, and the creation of a “joint-level tactical plan” to help different organisations cooperate more effectively.Some of the Cygnus recommendations, such as preparing legislation to relax certain laws and regulations, can be clearly seen in the government’s handling of Covid-19. A Department of Health spokesperson also mentioned excess deaths as an area where additional planning had been carried out.There are questions as to whether other recommendations were followed in full. Care sector executives told the  that they were unaware of having been asked to contribute to any methodology for assessing care home capacity.Though discussed at an NHS board meeting and mentioned in a speech by the former chief medical officer, the report on Cygnus has never been published, for reasons that are not entirely clear. The health secretary at the time of the exercise, Jeremy Hunt, has said he would be relaxed about the report being published.In a response to a freedom of information request, the Department of Health claimed that the report needed to be kept secret so as to inform policy development.However, the current health secretary, Matt Hancock, said in an interview with LBC last month that he had been told that all of its recommendations had already been implemented, suggesting its role in informing policy was complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e91223f22141744f3f7e3f4ed94a8c36395c3be4/0_85_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c735054f5a656d1ff50b525b43a02f","title":"yarls wood immigration removal centre held pandemic exercise in january","story":"Operation prompts questions about how much government knew about forecast scale of Covid-19 outbreakThe Home Office took part in a pandemic contingency exercise at an immigration removal centre as early as January, it has emerged, prompting questions about how much the government knew about the forecast scale of the Covid-19 outbreak.Sarah Burnett, the business operations director for justice and immigration at Serco, told MPs that the exercise took place at the Yarl’s Wood immigration centre with the involvement of the Home Office and Northamptonshire healthcare trust.Addressing the home affairs select committee, Burnett said the exercise allowed those involved to ensure they had sufficient stocks of personal protection equipment (PPE).Colin Dobell, the managing director at Mitie Care \u0026amp Custody, similarly told the committee that a pandemic contingency exercise took place with the Home Office at the Heathrow immigration removal centre (IRC) in February, allowing it to start reducing the numbers in detention in early March.The Labour MP Stephen Doughty asked the pair if they were surprised that the formal imposition of lockdown conditions did not happen until 23 March.Dobell replied: “We were communicating with Home Office all the way through it. It was clear from late February into early March what the strategy would be, which was really to reduce the number of detainees in the IRC.“We saw that take effect from early March, so from 8 March onwards the numbers in detention started to reduce dramatically.”The committee also heard evidence from providers of asylum seeker accommodation at Clearsprings Ready Homes and Mears Group, saying testing was not available for their service users despite hundreds of them isolating and living in accommodation with shared areas.Taking questions from the Conservative MP Laura Farris, Burnett said: “At Yarl’s Wood we held a full pandemic contingency planning exercise at the end of January, which ensured we were as prepared as we could be.”She added: “This was done at our instigation but with the Home Office and our healthcare partners Northampton healthcare trust. We worked on that as a tripartite plan which enabled us to get to a position where we could ensure we had sufficient stocks of PPE for example but also to redesign the regime to ensure we could continue to deliver essential services while maintaining the social distancing controls.”The Home Office has been approached for comment.After the hearing, Doughty said: “It was deeply concerning to hear that many residents and even staff across the asylum accommodation system do not appear to have been able to access testing, despite large numbers becoming symptomatic, which itself is unsurprising given the nature of shared accommodation.“It was also revealing that providers appear to have been asked to carry out more extensive pandemic planning from January onwards. This suggests that the Home Office internally knew that the pandemic was likely to worsen and spread in the UK and throws up yet more questions about who knew what, when, and why these insights did not lead to changes in other policies in other areas of Home Office work.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4247580.1588872713!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert plan b could see grades based on class rankings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnder the proposals, students would be able to appeal their results to the department and not to schools. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireLeaving Cert students may be awarded grades based on their class ranking and their performance in recent assessments under a potential ‘Plan B’ to the summer exams.The  understands that a draft Department of Education plan could involve school principals signing off on a process where teachers award provisional grades based on student performance to date.These grades would then likely feed into a process where final grades could be awarded using a “bell curve” and other indicators.This bell curve refers to the practice of adjusting the marking process to ensure a similar proportion of students secure the same numbers of H1s, H2s and H3s each year.Students would be able to appeal their results to the department and not to schools.Sources have emphasised that this option is still a proposal at this stage but would be likely to secure the backing of secondary teachers’ unions.The ASTI and TUI have been holding meetings on Thursday to examine the proposals and discuss issues with senior members.The move towards producing a “Plan B” comes amid a growing concern over the health risks of pressing ahead with the exams during the summer.Both unions are understood to have expressed grave concern over the safety of proceeding with two weeks of school in July and staging exams during a private meeting with department officials on Wednesday. These fears focused on what safety measures would be in place for social distancing, what hygiene practices would be required and whether teachers and staff would be required to wear personal protecting equipment, according to sources.Departmental ‘dysfunctionality’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil on Thursday the Government would “try to bring a conclusion” this week to the uncertainty surrounding the Leaving Cert.He said it was possible to carry out the exam within existing public health guidelines “but it would not be the Leaving Certificate as we know it.“If it is cancelled we must make sure that we can put in place an alternative which would be fair, which is extremely difficult.”He was responding to sharp opposition criticism of the handling of the crisis, claims of “dysfunctionality” in the Department of Education and allegations that the Government was “bullying” students.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said the current position was “unacceptable”.Comparing Ireland’s response to that of other EU states on handling final exams, he said that “nowhere has there been such a lack of clarity and confusion. The fact that the reopening document published last week failed to address it is remarkable.“We are now beyond the stage where clarity must be provided and the Government must be honest about the ability to complete the leaving certificate in the coming months.”Labour leader Alan Kelly described the Government’s handling as “an unmitigated disaster” and he called for the Taoiseach to intervene.“The stress these students have been put under is intolerable. This needs to be finished. We need a ‘Plan B’ and it needs to be out there this week.”Solidarity TD Mick Barry said there was a “crisis of democratic legitimacy” around the exams as he pointed to a survey of almost 24,000 students, 79 per cent of whom wanted cancellation and just 15 per cent wanted the exams to go ahead.Mr Barry said students felt they were “in effect being bullied by the Government”.The official position of Minister for Education Joe McHugh remains that plans are continuing for the exams to commence on July 29th, subject to public health advice.He has also stated that his preference is for schools to return for two weeks ahead of the exams, to allow students catch up on coursework or engage with teachers.However, the fact that teachers have major health concerns will be a major factor in determining whether the exams can go ahead.In addition, an overwhelming majority of students want the exams to be cancelled, based on a survey this week by the Irish Secondary Students’ Association.The issue of teachers’ grading their students has been a source of major opposition within teachers’ unions in the past.However, sources say unions recognise the urgent need for an alternative to the Leaving Cert and for unions to be seen to support students."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: The St Mary’s is one of the worst hit nursing homes in the country with 24 confirmed coronavirus deaths. The home is run by the Health Service Executive, has 150 beds and a separate 48 bed step-down hospital.On Wednesday a staff member made a whistleblower’s report, known as a protected disclosure, alleging shortcomings in the facility’s response to Covid-19.It is understood the healthcare worker attempted to flag concerns with nursing home management. In an April 4th email to senior management, seen by The  and sent at onset of the outbreak in the home, the staff member expressed concerns over the criteria for when healthcare workers should wear PPE, and that the process of identifying suspected coronavirus patients was “unclear”.The email stated the worker was “gravely concerned” about the lack of gear for front-line workers, over fears staff would transmit the virus from one resident to others.The staff member also queried the practice that protective equipment should not be worn if a patient presented with one symptom only of coronavirus. “If someone has one symptom, and we are not using PPE, there is an obvious risk that if the person does actually have Covid-19 we as front-line workers will get Covid-19 and will be carriers, transmitting it to other residents,” said the staff member. The email also expressed fears that suspected coronavirus patients were being moved between wards. In response senior management sent the staff member the Health Protection Surveillance Centre guidelines on the use of PPE and insisted the clinical criteria for identifying suspected coronavirus cases was clear. The staff member’s 35-page protected disclosure noted concerns “fell on deaf ears” and they faced “alienation and disapproval” for highlighting the issues. The protected disclosure was sent to HSE chief executive Paul Reid and Minister for Health Simon Harris. The staff member called for a statutory inquiry to be set up, or failing that an independent external inquiry. The nursing home had its first confirmed coronavirus case on March 28th and the first death from the virus on April 2nd. Over the course of last month Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout the care home to nearly every ward, with almost half of residents contracting the virus. Adjusting guidelinesIn a March 26th email, St Mary’s staff had been instructed on the “prudent” rationing of protective equipment. “The unnecessary use of PPE will deplete stocks which will be needed as the number of people with the virus increases,” the email stated. All staff were reminded that HSE guidelines did not recommend the use of face masks when treating confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases “in situations other than close contact”. However, following the nursing home outbreak all staff are now required to wear face masks. A HSE spokeswoman has previously said the use of protective equipment and testing in the home had followed National Public Health Emergency Team guidelines. In response to the outbreak the home had put in place infection control measures, with the assistance of consultants from the Mater hospital. The HSE spokeswoman said the facility had “adequate” supply of protective equipment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241903.1588854367!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus may have been in ireland last year taoiseach says","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar accused Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald of being ‘two-faced’ in an argument over the pandemic payment.  Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar speaking in the DáilTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said it is possible that the coronavirus was already in Ireland last year or in January this year.“We should not assume that it came here from Italy in late February just because the first confirmed case did so,” he told the Dáil. Mr Varadkar said retrospective testing suggested the virus was circulation in France as far back as December last year, before it was even had a name or test.This in some ways “was not surprising as France was well connected to China with dozens of flights every day and Ireland is very connected to France”. More research was needed and time would tell, he added.In sharp exchanges during a debate on the coronavirus crisis, Mr Varadkar confirmed the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) of €350 a week would continue beyond mid-June as he rounded on Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, accusing her of being “two-faced”.Comparing her party’s actions in the North to the behaviour of the US president, Mr Varadkar said Sinn Féin’s ministers in Northern Ireland “promote the fact that they hand food parcels to the poor - reminiscent to me of Donald Trump, handing out toilet roll after the hurricane hit the islands in the Caribbean”.Ms McDonald had hit out at comments by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe that the PUP could not continue forever and she said that to cut it would be to “to pull the rug from under the feet of so many and force those who can least afford it to pay for the economic fallout from this emergency”.During the Dáil debate, she said suggestions of the payment being ended showed that “Fine Gael remains out of touch with the lives of workers and families, with those bearing the brunt of this economic shock”.She said Mr Donohoe’s comments “sent a shiver of apprehension down with the spines of those who suffered untold hardship as a result of the vicious cuts meted out by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil over the past decade”. But the Taoiseach described the payment as an unprecedented action, and said it was not affordable for it to last forever.However “it will need to continue. At least until people have the opportunity to return to their jobs.“And for the vast majority that won’t be possible before mid-June. And so yes it will need to be extended beyond mid-June”.But accusing Ms McDonald of becoming “so party political in her contributions” he said she was being “so two-faced and so fundamentally dishonest”.He compared the State’s social welfare system to that in the North where Sinn Féin was in office and said the payment was £100 a week with nothing for the self-employed until June.He claimed Sinn Féin “boasts” about giving food parcels. “I’d be ashamed to do something like that.”But Ms McDonald said grants of £10,000 or £25,000 were being made to businesses in the North across all sectors, and that in the six counties the payment was “far greater than the entire €250million, which is pretty miserly that’s been set out here”.She pointed out that it was not just in the North that people were struggling noting that St Vincent de Paul launched a fundraising campaign, an acknowledgement of the fact that we have a lot of needy people”.The Taoiseach said the Government funded food banks and had done so for a long time but but they did not “post on Facebook pictures of our ministers and visiting them, and handing out food to the poor”. Sinn Féin was doing “more for business than they are doing for the employed in the North”.Mr Varadkar also rejected criticism that Ireland was slower to ease lockdown measures than other countries.“It is true we are slower than countries much less affected than us like Australia, New Zealand, and slower than countries much worse affected than us, like Spain and Belgium.”But the Taoiseach said Ireland was testing at a much higher rate than in New Zealand or Australia and was between third and seventh in the world for testing ahead of Germany and of other countries including South Korea.He said “this is a decision the Government made” and “it’s one we stand over”.He said he would rather be in a situation where the State might accelerate the pace of return than having to pause or reverse or re-impose restrictions, like some other countries. To have to do so would profoundly affect morale, Mr Varadkar said. He said the curve has been flattened and plateaued, but society’s grief had not. “The stakes are too high to rush things now.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4247328.1588854649!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lunar lockdown 2020 s last supermoon to light up irish skies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe last supermoon of the year, the flower moon, will be visible in Irish skies on Thursday and Friday night.

Photograph: Valerie MaconAFP via Getty ImagesOne apparent silver lining to coronavirus is that it is a “great equaliser”, as New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, put it.Covid-19 can strike Wall Street executives and janitors alike. But try telling that to Amazon’s workforce. Several of its employees have been fired for voicing fears about exposure to the virus. Amazon’s workers are being treated like “fungible units of pick-and-pack potential”, said Tim Bray, a senior Amazon engineer who this week resigned in protest. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the company’s chief executive, earned an estimated $149,353 a minute before the pandemic struck, three times the annual US median income. Amazon’s revenues have soared since then.We heard a lot about how jet-setters were as exposed to infection as the rest in Covid-19’s early weeks. Whether it was Hollywood star Tom Hanks or Britain’s Prince Charles, the initial impression was of the pathogen’s blind egalitarianism. The lockdown changed all that.Social distancing favours the better off. They tend to live in less densely populated areas, with fewer people per household. They are also much likelier to be able to continue to work remotely. Both their earnings and wellbeing are far better shielded from the microbe.In a breakdown of the disease’s effects on New York, a study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research shows that the poorer your zipcode, the likelier you are to have died. The same applies to jobs. Those working in transport, healthcare, delivery, grocery stores or construction are likelier to have died than people working from home. The same is true anywhere. Infection rates in Singapore and Dubai are resurging as the microbe hits migrant workers housed in dormitories in semi-segregated parts of town. New York’s boroughs ide people along similar lines.New Yorkers lift everyone’s spirits by banging pots and pans each night in appreciation of essential workers. Public solidarity is a valuable thing. But it does not deliver protective gear to those who are daily exposed to the virus. Many tip the people who deliver Amazon’s products and other packages to their doors. Again, the sentiment is laudable. But it only makes up for a little of the hazard pay such workers are not receiving. For many years, particularly since 911, Americans have been thanking armed forces personnel for their service. While benefits have improved, such displays have had little impact on their pay rates. Rescue billCoronavirus hit a US economy with pre-existing conditions. More than 33 million Americans, almost a quarter of the civilian workforce, lack paid sick leave. Over half of those employed in hospitality, leisure and travel have no health insurance. In late March, the US Congress passed a $2 trillion (€1.85 trillion) rescue bill that covered most Americans affected by the lockdown (in theory some have still not received their cheques). It was a good package under the circumstances, and compared well to the modest fiscal efforts of many European democracies. But that bill is likely to have marked Washington’s peak. As the US reopens, Americans who cannot work from home face an unenviable dilemma.A majority of states are now easing their lockdowns. This poses two dangers. The first is that most states have rising or flat rates of Covid-19 infection. They are ignoring the White House’s already diluted guidelines for reopening. One of these is that a state should see 14 consecutive days of falling infections before easing. Returning to work in these conditions is personally risky. It is also collectively dangerous. A leaked draft of a government report forecasts the daily US death rate rising from around 2,000 now to 3,000 by June.The second is that workers who don’t show up for work risk losing their current income, whether that was stay-at-home wages or unemployment benefits. Yet at the same time, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, insists the next relief bill must give employers liability protection against employees or customers who catch the disease. Most states do not legally mandate that businesses give protective gear to staff. Such dilemmas confront only those who have to leave home to keep on earning – often by crowded transport.America’s premature reopening makes a travesty of the idea that the pathogen is a great leveller. US consumers are lucky to have providers as inventive as Amazon and meat processors as productive as Tyson. Such service comes at a far steeper price than the bills they see. “Thank-you for your service,” is a thin mask for the underlying reality. The US entered the pandemic in a rousing spirit of equality. It is gradually exiting the lockdown more unequal than it began. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain criticised around world dither delay coronavirus response","story":"It began as background mutterings, but it has now become a chorus. As the number of fatalities has grown, other countries have looked on in stunned disbelief at what they judge to be delays, missteps and complacency in the UK\u0027s response to the growing threat posed by coronavirus.And with the British death toll reaching almost 30,000 – the highest in Europe – that criticism is now being voiced by newspapers and commentators around the world.One of the most damning assessments came in The Sydney Morning Herald at the weekend, when Australia\u0027s oldest newspaper published a long read headlined \u0027Biggest failure in a generation\u0027: Where did Britain go wrong?’It highlighted the case of 53-year-old consultant urologist Abdul Chowdhury who, three weeks before his death from Covid-19, had urged Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, to make sure every health worker in Britain was given personal protective equipment (PPE), and whose son Intisar subsequently went on air to ask Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, for an apology.For the Herald, Intisar Chowdhury spoke on behalf of many who think Britain\u0027s response to the crisis has suffered from a series of deadly mistakes and miscalculations.In common with several other international critics, the paper focused on four main failings by the UK: the lack of PPE for healthcare workers, the repeated delays in implementing a lockdown, a bungled test and tracing regime, and the failure to protect vulnerable care home residents from the ravages of the virus.Dr Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet medical journal, told the Herald in a phrase the paper would use for its headline: The handling of the Covid-19 crisis in the UK is the most serious science policy failure in a generation.The Herald contrasted border closures in Australia and New Zealand with Britain\u0027s open-door policy, with restrictions on people flying in from Wuhan imposed only briefly and those passengers still arriving under no obligation to self-isolate.Mike Rann, a former Australian high commissioner to Britain, told the newspaper that the UK made crucial mistakes at a time when they had the most damaging impact. The earliest stages were handled negligently. A shambles of mixed messaging, poor organisation and a complacent attitude that what was happening in Italy wouldn\u0027t happen here, he said.The decision taken on March 12 to abandon mass testing has also been questioned, with the Herald and others suggesting this meant the Government could only guess who was infected with the virus and how it was behaving, meaning the extent of its spread would not become obvious until hospitals began to fill with seriously ill patients.Across the Atlantic, similar questions are being asked.CNN this week broadcast a three-minute package asking what went wrong with the UK\u0027s initial handling of the virus, showing footage of packed Tube trains from the period before a lockdown was implemented, along with flashbacks to early Government briefings when the concept of Britain acquiring herd immunity guided its thinking.The New Yorker Magazine was even more forthright in its criticism – just as it has been of the Trump administration\u0027s response:In the above article published on Tuesday, it characterised Britain\u0027s handling of the pandemic as a curious mixture of superiority and fatalism... which has been slow and calamitous.The magazine pointed out that Britain has an internationally respected public health apparatus and that, in October 2016, the UK Government\u0027s Exercise Cygnus had shown how a global influenza pandemic would overwhelm the nation\u0027s health system and ravage the economy.Despite this, it says British officials dithered in the face of reports of a new coronavirus coming out of China and continued to hesitate as the virus tore through northern Italy, just at the point lessons needed to be learnt – and quickly.The British Government\u0027s short-lived adherence to the herd immunity theory was also criticised in Turkey, where the state-run Anadolu news agency published an op-ed by a researcher in international politics at Istanbul University suggesting that this distracted and prevented the UK Government from taking necessary steps at the time when they could have had significant impact on stemming the spread of the virus.Separately, the Reuters news agency focused, in a special report published on Tuesday, on Britain\u0027s failure to protect the elderly and their carers.Highlighting, among others, the case of 26-year-old care home worker Sonya Kaygan, one of over 100 UK front line health workers killed by coronavirus, it pointed out that care homes struggled to get access to tests and PPE.It also suggested the elderly were put at potentially greater risk by measures to admit only the sickest for hospital treatment and to clear out as many non-acute patients as possible from wards in order to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.Worse was to come, said the report, with the measures needed to protect the elderly in care homes,  such as testing and supplies of PPE, simply not available.In Spain, El País last week ran a stinging editorial, describing the UK Government\u0027s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as incomprehensible, with the article singling out Mr Johnson for criticism after he turned a deaf ear to the severity of the crisis for several weeks, to the point that he declined to attend five emergency committee meetings and instead enjoyed 12 joyful days of vacation.The initial plan of promoting herd immunity was condemned in the editorial as an uncompassionate approach and a Darwinian calculation, and it noted how the UK continued to allow planes from countries with large epidemics to land long after the risks of doing so were obvious.The editorial said Mr Johnson\u0027s Government was reckless in opting out of the joint procurement scheme for medical equipment alongside the 27 EU member states, and suggested Brexit chickens are coming home to roost as the NHS suffers personnel problems due to the Government\u0027s lack of interest in retaining European health workers.Everything points to Johnson choosing to disguise the economic and social costs of his hard Brexit with the even harder blows from the multiple crisis the pandemic is already causing, the article concluded.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"humans do replay events waking hours sleep scientists conclude","story":"Scientists have proved for the first time that humans replay events from their waking hours as they sleep - and that dreaming is a crucial part of how we form memories.In a groundbreaking study, researchers were able to watch people playing out what had happened in their day, with their brains mimicking the same neuronal firing patterns as those exhibited before they went to bed.This is the first direct evidence that we relive real-life experiences in our sleep, and could help explain how memories are consolidated in the mind.The process had previously been observed in animals, but brain imaging techniques have so far not been advanced enough to test the theory on humans.The study, published in the journal Cell Reports, was a collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital in the US and the company Braingate, which is developing technology to restore the communication, mobility, and independence of people with neurologic disease, injury, or limb loss.Dr Beata Jarosiewicz, a senior research scientist from BrainGate, said: This is the first piece of direct evidence that in humans, we also see replay during rest following learning that might help to consolidate those memories.The study is unprecedented. All the replay-related memory consolidation mechanisms that we\u0027ve studied in animals for all these decades might actually generalise to humans as well.The study involved monitoring the brain activity of two people with tetraplegia - a condition which results in partial or full paralysis of all four limbs.These subjects were chosen as they already had implants inserted in the motor cortex of their brains as part of their treatment. The implants allow them to move a cursor on a screen just by thinking about it.The researchers fitted the pair with electrodes to record their brain activity then asked them to move the cursor in a series of patterns, some of which they were told to repeat many times.The participants then went to sleep for 30 minutes with the electrodes still monitoring their neuronal firing patterns - the communication between neurones in the brain.While the subjects were asleep, the neuronal firing patterns they had exhibited when they were awake and moving the cursor were re-performed by their brains so often that the scientists concluded this was not mere coincidence.The hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning, appeared to have taken a snapshot of their waking brain patterns then reactivated them later during sleep to make the memory permanent.Dr Jarosiewicz said the study shows that sleep is a vital part of how we learn.We have good scientific evidence that sleep is very important in these processes, she said. There is still much we don\u0027t understand about sleep, but it is clear that it is important for the brain.Further research is now needed to better understand exactly what phase of sleep best triggers this kind of replay mechanism, and whether the strength of this replay mechanism might be altered to improve memory and learning.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside story princesses elizabeth margaret celebrated ve day","story":"According to the adage, usually attributed to Winston Churchill, history is written by the victors. But what happens when there are multiple accounts?During the time I spent researching A Royal Night Out – the 2015 film I co-wrote with Kevin Hood – this quickly became a recurring question.The film dramatises how 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth (played by Emily Watson) and her sister, 15-year-old Princess Margaret (Sarah Gadon), spent VE Day on May 8, 1945. But whose account of their adventure – and there are many… – is closest to what actually happened that night?The story of the princesses secretly taking part in the VE Day celebrations had lain dormant for years, until the incident was touched upon by the BBC as a footnote to a piece on the 60th anniversary of the end of the war. This item then came to the attention of film producers Ecosse Films and Lionsgate, who thought the princesses out on the town celebrating incognito could make a great movie. As a result, I was approached about developing this half-forgotten historical snippet into a screenplay.Although the tale we tell is clearly a work of imagination, rooting our story in truth was important. But whose truth?I read royal biographies and wartime social histories until my eyes hurt. In each account, the Princesses’ VE night celebrations would usually merit a paragraph or two, but even here the writers were drawing on different sources. I dug out old footage of TV shows featuring, mostly, Ladies-in-Waiting, who professed to having actually being there on the night. Yet no two accounts were ever the same.One account claimed that the Princesses left Buckingham Palace, crossed Green Park, arms linked, 40 abreast with a large number of other revellers, all of whom came from the royal palace. Some quoted more modest numbers – 12 or so courtesans accompanying the Princesses down Whitehall and on to The Mall, where they watched their parents on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.Other accounts suggest that the Princesses went out accompanied by a small group of friends, with just a couple of officers to keep an eye on them. One even has Princess Elizabeth dancing a jig with a sailor until disengaged by her chaperone. Some maintain Princess Elizabeth wore her ATM uniform, while others suggest she was in civvies.Among all these conflicting stories, one of the few consistencies was that the Princesses visited The Ritz that night, where they danced the conga.The Princess’s governess Marion Crawford, better known as Nannie Crawford, was another interesting source. Her book The Little Princesses, a 1950s bestseller, touched upon the event: The King allowed his two daughters to go out of the gates and among the crowds. Two Guards officers took them, and they joined the revellers outside, and called with the rest, for the King and Queen to come out.Maureen Waller’s excellent portrait of the final months of the war, London 1945, quotes Robert Westall’s Children of the Blitz, which in turn recounts, 50 years on, Queen Elizabeth’s own recollection: “We cheered the King and Queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief… I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my life.”The film website imdb, in its entry about A Royal Night Out, suggests the plot is based on extracts from the Queen’s “diary” (not a text I’ve ever come across…): “Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Pall Mall, walked simply miles. Saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate, partied, bed 3am!”Perhaps such variations are to be expected. After all, memories fade and, over time, accounts become embellished or tweaked to serve the teller. One person’s half-truth becomes gospel, especially when committed to print, and before you know it, urban myth becomes accepted reality.So who to believe?In the end, the film itself made the decisions. I was commissioned to write the princesses’ story as a screwball comedy, in the style of classic black-and-white romances involving themes of escape and disguise such as It Happened One Night, Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday. Typically, in these films, an upper-class female lead and a male character hailing from a much humbler background are thrown together after a cute chance meeting.So, in A Royal Night Out we paired the future Queen of England, out with her sister incognito, with a low-ranking airman and had them meeting for the first time upstairs on a double-decker bus where, embarrassingly, Elizabeth has no money for her fare.Now we knew the general direction of the movie, we cherry-picked the accounts that best served the story. Deferring to Nannie Crawford, we had two Guards Officers as incompetent chaperones, who were also useful for comic relief. We took Elizabeth and Margaret to The Ritz and had them dancing the conga, as suggested by several accounts, and we also incorporated a scene where the Princesses are outside the Palace waving at their parents on the balcony. Beyond these elements, the rest of the movie is a work of imagination and invention.Of course, filmmakers have always played fast and loose with the truth. Obscure, little-known facts become launchpads for entire movies. Timelines are stretched or squashed. Multiple characters are combined into a single composite or sometimes culled altogether for the sake of brevity. This is the nature of nature story-telling. Indeed, producers have to be creative to deliver a movie and we were no different. It’s just another sleight of hand.Take, for example, the locations used by A Royal Night Out. Chatsworth House and Belvoir Castle double for the interiors of Buckingham Palace. Hull stands in for the streets (and pubs) of London the Hotel pole in Brussels stood in for The Ritz.That said, one of the biggest scenes in the film which takes place in Trafalgar Square as Big Ben chimes midnight, signalling the start of peacetime, was actually shot in Trafalgar Square. How do we know this is true? Because I was there that night. You have my word!A final point. Although the quote about history being written by the victors is attributed to Churchill, a quick Google search suggests otherwise. Ironically, Hermann Göring is reported at having said it during the Nuremburg trials – and, going back further still, so too did Maximilien Robespierre.Clearly, it is hard to uncover absolute truth, especially when there are so many versions. Which perhaps lends credence to the whispered suggestion that the story of Elizabeth and Margaret escaping the palace for one night of adventure was actually invented by some bright spark at the Ministry of Information as a feel-good PR stunt.Now that would be a story…A Royal Night Out is available to watch on Amazon Prime and other selected streaming servicesMore from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jersey poised launch lockdown exit strategy can uk learn islanders","story":"Jersey has launched a detailed four-point exit strategy to return life to normal, in what could provide a blueprint for how Britain lifts its own lockdown.From next week, residents will be allowed to meet and socialise with up to five friends and relatives, as the controlled lifting of the current restrictions begins.Officials on the island, who have been in charge of their own Covid-19 response, have set out and published a detailed strategy covering all aspects of public life.The four-stage plan explains to its 100,000 residents how they can expect to see life return to normal in the weeks ahead.Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, is currently at Level 4 of its exit strategy, which maintains the stay at home policy, keeps school and colleges closed and prevents large scale gatherings.But on Tuesday, Jersey’s Chief Minister, John Le Fondré Jr, is expected to announce a move to Level 3, described as a ‘soft lockdown’, which will dramatically ease restrictions.The stay at home order will be formally lifted and there will be no restrictions on the amount of time people can spend outside.While social distancing of two metres will still be required, residents will be permitted to spend time with up to five people from outside their household.Schools and colleges on the island will remain closed until May 22, but more children of key workers will be offered places during this period as they attempt to achieve full opening before the summer term ends.All outdoor work will resume and groups of five people will be allowed to operate together on building sites and other premises.Non-essential shops will be given the green light to open and restaurants and cafes with outdoor spaces will be allowed to start serving again.Office based businesses will be encouraged to continue allowing staff to work from home where possible, they will be permitted to let workers return in stages.The plans are thought to go further than what Boris Johnson will announce on Sunday and if successful will allow Jersey to quickly move towards Level 2, or ‘soft opening’ which could come before the beginning of June.That stage will allow gatherings of up to ten people, and should also see the opening of schools and colleges on the island.Healthcare and dental practices will reopen and pubs and bars that serve food will also be given the green light, although they will be asked to operate a reservation only service initially.Level 2 will also see libraries, community centres, youth centres, places of worship, museums and galleries, cinemas, theatres and concert venues, reopen, subject to social distancing rules.The final strand of the exit framework is known as Level 1, or ‘physical distancing’, will signal a move towards some degree of normality in Jersey.Islanders will be allowed to mix with groups of up to 25, and sporting events will be allowed to resume without spectators.Groups of up to 10 people will be allowed to meet inside and working from home will also be phased out.Pubs on the island will be allowed to reopen but customers will be required to sit down at spaced tables, to maintain strict social distancing. Venues will also be required to close by 10pm.Hotels, self-catering accommodation, caravan parks and campsites will also be allowed to reopen subject to guidelines and people will be allowed to travel to and from the island for the first time.Throughout all the four levels of Jersey’s exit strategy, social distancing of two metres will be required and locals will also be encouraged to wear cloth masks when out in the public.Announcing a move towards a soft lockdown next week, Mr Le Fondré told islanders: “Since Saturday, people have been enjoying their four hours permitted outside their homes, but have been doing so in a responsible way that limits the spread of Covid-19. “Because of your actions, we are in a really good place. We’ve seen a minimal increase in the number of positive cases we’ve begun our antibody testing programme and enhanced contract tracing and the Nightingale Hospital has been handed over to medical staff.“We can now look carefully at how we will move through the levels of our Safe Exit Framework. Our expectation is that we will move into Level 3 from the beginning of next week.”While Jersey’s detailed exit strategy could provide ministers in Westminster with a guide to the mainland’s approach, the island has had relatively few coronavirus cases.According to the latest data, Jersey has had 293 confirmed cases and 25 deaths.The island’s lockdown was introduced on March 30, a week after Boris Johnson announced the UK strategy.But with a smaller population and restrictions on travel, the lockdown was less stringent, with residents allowed to exercise for two hours a day. That was increased to four hours last Saturday and locals have also been allowed to visit anywhere on the island in order to take their exercise.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/07/07/o2-virgin-media-merger.jpg","title":"virgin media o2 merger media giant business value","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Agreement to unlock £10bn investment in UK over five years once completed, says Virgin Media ownerVirgin Media and O2\u0026nbspare to merge to create a £31bn\u0026nbspmedia and telecoms giant, their parent companies announced on Thursday.The merger is expected to be complete by next year, as it is subject to regulatory clearances.Liberty Global, the US media firm that owns TV and broadband provider Virgin Media, said the agreement would unlock a £10bn investment in the UK market over five years once completed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMike Fries, CEO\u0026nbspof Liberty Global, said: “We couldn’t be more excited about this combination.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe report follows comments made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has consistently denounced\u0026nbspthe lockdown\u0026nbspin the United States. The US has more confirmed\u0026nbspcoronavirus cases than any other country in the world,\u0026nbsprecently topping one million.Mr Musk said the lockdown was “fascist” and demanded authorities “give people back their goddamn freedom”.Elon Musk tweet about \u0027too high\u0027 share price sees Tesla plummet $14bn“I would call it ‘forcibly imprisoning people in their homes’ against all their constitutional rights, in my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country,” Mr Musk also said in a call last week.However, despite the potential for the plant to re-open, a spokesperson for the Fremont Police Department said there were no plans to investigate the site.“We’re all sort of in a little bit of a grey area,” said department spokesperson Geneva Bosques. This is because of the state governor\u0027s announcement that some business would be allowed to operate on a small scale if adequate safety measures were taken.Two previous visits were made to the plant, Mr Bosques said, where it was found that Tesla was following basic minimum operations.It would not be the first time that Tesla has defied shelter-in-place orders. The company insisted workers continue for a week after 17 March, when the conditions were put in place, even though the plant was deemed non-essential by health authorities. The order, which remains in place, forbids “manufacturing or assembly of nonessential products.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Los Angeles, US, 700 food packages will go to homeless military veterans. Other projects are in India and Ethiopia.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Naomi Hallum, director of the organisation, which is funded by donations, said: “We hope that the $100,000 of food we are giving will help relieve some of the suffering caused by Covid-19, but the real value of our work lies in education, in telling people how and why these pandemics emerge, in showing the destruction caused to our planet and our bodies when we eat animal products.“The coronavirus pandemic, like many others before it, is creating tragedies for families all over the world. None of us wants this to happen ever again but to prevent future outbreaks, there are some difficult lessons we must learn.“If we continue to stress wild animals by decimating their habitats and capture and cage them in markets — and if we continue to mass produce domesticated animals inside squalid factory farms and transport them long distances — there will be no avoiding a future pandemic.”T Colin Campbell, professor emeritus of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University, New York, claimed: “A wholefoods plant-based diet can prevent, perhaps even reverse, the chronic degenerative diseases that make older iniduals more susceptible to Covid-19.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For families in a two-bedroom home, the shortfall is as high as £400 a month outside of London, and up to £1,227 in the capital.Shelter says that those relying on benefits must find an estimated £13m a week in total to keep up with their rent payments.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe government has suspended evictions for the duration of the crisis, but thousands could be forced out of their homes when the lockdown ends.Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter, has warned of a “tsunami of evictions” amid the “serious financial difficulty” that people across the country are now facing.“As renters lose their jobs and see their incomes hit, many will have to rely on the welfare safety net for the first time,” she said.“Our services are already hearing from families in homes they could comfortably afford under normal circumstances, who are now in serious financial difficulty.“We’re facing an onslaught of people suddenly unable to afford their rent, at a time when people need to stay put and cannot safely move to a cheaper home.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Aarts, an activist, philanthropist and chef, said: “We have ramped up from 200 to 3,900 meals a day but the move to Wembley will allow us to gear up further to cook and deliver 20,000 meals a day – which is 140,000 meals a week.How to support our campaign“We already supply 15 hospitals, elderly care homes, community centres and homeless hostels. These organisations are trying to cope with unprecedented demand for food and they keep asking us for more.

The fresh, raw produce comes daily from The Felix Project, the biggest distributor of surplus food in London, which has quadrupled its deliveries since lockdown to 40 tonnes a day and supplies daily more than 100 charities, schools and community hubs like Compassion London.The Independent has pledged to raise £10m to help The Felix Project feed hungry people across the capital over the next three years – with £3.65m already donated since we launched our appeal on 27 March.The Wembley facility is being given to Compassion London free of charge, thanks to Wembley Stadium, its in-house caterer Delaware North and the stadium’s owner, the Football Association.Top restaurant chefs join forces to provide free meals for familiesPhoebe Waller-Bridge backs our appealOur appeal raises £3.5m as food crisis deepensHead chef Mr Lomas said: “Using an empty kitchen and bringing food together to feed vulnerable people and the NHS is fantastic.

I think she might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary\u0027s book in terms of tone.“I’m afraid what she said is not true.

I would hope everyone can agree that that is a good thing. If fewer people are going into hospital with coronavirus symptoms that will mean fewer tests need to be carried out in NHS setting. Likewise, if there\u0027s less community transmission, it will mean that key workers potentially need fewer tests. That shouldn\u0027t be seen as a bad thing.The key point is capacity has been really significantly increased. We can now do more than 100,000 tests a day and as we move forward into the next phase, including the rollout of \u0027trace, track and test\u0027, we have the capacity we need.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The leadership of the Labour Party was number one, fair or unfair.”Sir Keir, who campaigned for Labour to adopt a pro-EU stance and was largely sidelined by party strategists during the campaign, also said Brexit was another issue raised on the doorstep of voters.Starmer calls for \u0027national consensus\u0027 on lifting lockdownOn Labour’s strategy during the coronavirus pandemic, Sir Keir said his party needed to be “constructive” when criticising No 10’s failures, as he confirmed in a separate interview he would support another extension to the UK-wide lockdown.Pressed on the issue on the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he said he believed the restrictions should remain in place until “we are sure the infection rate has gone down”.Later today, Boris Johnson will decide whether to extend the lockdown by another three weeks, but is not expected to address the nation until Sunday evening where he will also set out the government’s next steps in the crisis and any restrictions that may be eased in the coming weeks.Sir Keir added: “I would be very surprised if the government doesn’t reimpose the lockdown when it comes up for review later on and we will support them in that. This is not about lifting the lockdown now, it’s about planning for the future.“Of course we want the number of infected cases to go down, we want the death toll to go down but we’ve got to also plan for the future and I’m convinced testing, tracing and isolating is going to have to be a part of any strategy fro the future.“But if that’s going to happen the planning needs to go in now because we need many many more tests than we’ve got already”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we go for elimination, the only way the virus can get on to this island is by importation.”​Mr Varadkar has meanwhile said that the country’s pandemic payments, which are supporting workers and business affected by the crisis, will continue beyond mid-June but warned they cannot last forever.The coronavirus death toll in Ireland rose to 1,375 on Wednesday after 37 more deaths were announced.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s likely the true circumstances are somewhat\u0026nbspdifferent\u0026nbsp— but no less horrific. Oliver Carroll reports from MoscowIn Russia, the news this week should have been about Covid-19 taking ever greater chunks out of the country. An unexpected surge in infections has, after all, made it the fifth-most affected nation on earth — with little sign of the crisis abating.Instead, headlines around the world have been dominated by a more unusual effect of the virus in Russia – a\u0026nbspspree\u0026nbspof frontline workers falling out of windows.In the course of eight days from 24 April to 2 May, three medics plunged to the ground. Two have already been buried by their colleagues one is fighting for his life in intensive care with a fractured skull. In all three cases, there is evidence of serious conflict with hospital authorities over the coronavirus response.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSome international media have used these tragedies to tempt\u0026nbspreaders into the assumption that\u0026nbspRussian medics are being shadowed by government hitmen. In doing so, they draw attention away from a far more likely reality, and one that is no less horrific.From conversations with friends and colleagues of the victims, The Independent\u0026nbsphas pieced together a picture of medical staff working under intolerable strain. The victims were pinched at least two ways: inadequately protected while working face to face with an invisible killer and\u0026nbsppushed to the brink by a management class petrified of losing status and privilege.Face to face with coronavirus on a Moscow Covid-19 wardRussia would not be alone in seeing its medical staff succumb to apparent suicide amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Across Europe and the United States, doctors, nurses, and ambulance staff have taken their lives as a direct result of the virus. Some were\u0026nbspfearful after contracting the disease, and left suicide notes about their despair. Others feared infecting others.But in Russia, a cocktail of guilt, secrecy and scapegoating seems to be exacerbating the stresses and strains of working through the pandemic.Scapegoating seems to be the most obvious trigger for the first of the deaths on 24 April. Up until her untimely end, Natalya Lebedeva\u0026nbspwas an experienced ambulance service manager working in Star City, the restricted cosmonaut training outpost fifteen miles east of Moscow. Lebedeva died after falling from the fifth floor of a hospital in southeast Moscow where she had been receiving treatment for Covid-19. She was 48.According to a colleague, bosses had placed Lebedeva in charge of hospitalising important Covid-19 patients from Star City. Unfortunately, she became infected in the process and unwittingly formed part of a chain of infections that saw almost two dozen people hospitalised. The colleague, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed to The Independent that superiors had blamed Lebedeva for failing to contain the virus locally. This seems to have led her to take her own life.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastJust one day following Lebedeva’s apparent suicide, a second medic would fall five floors from a hospital window. Yelena Nepomnyashaya, 47, the acting head doctor at the veterans’ hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, died from her injuries a week later.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA source in the veterans’ hospital described the manager as an upbeat inidual who was well-liked by staff. But she was also reportedly\u0026nbspuneasy with the local authority’s plans to use the hospital to fulfil a presidential quota for additional Covid-19 capacity. The hospital wasn’t yet ready for such a switch, Nepomnyashaya believed: it had only one ventilator and inadequate stocks of protective equipment. Right up to her death, the head doctor was pushing to have the equipment in place, the source said.There is some confusion as to what conversations took place between the hospital chief and Boris Nemik, the local health minister. The regional bureaucrat denies any contact was made. But\u0026nbspThe Independent’s source insists otherwise: that a conference call took place shortly before Nepomnyashaya fell to her death.“Yelena wasn’t unstable or an obvious suicide risk, but god only knows\u0026nbspthe threats and impossible demands that were made,” the source said. “The thing we all fear now is that her death will be written off as the suicide of an unhinged woman who could not cope.”The thing we all fear now is that Yelena’s death will be written off as the suicide of an unhinged woman who could not copeThe third incident, which took place a week later, is more enigmatic. Paramedic Alexander Shulepov, 37, fell from the first floor of a hospital while receiving treatment for Covid-19. He remains in intensive care with serious injuries including a fractured skull.Again, there are signs of a\u0026nbspconflict with management over\u0026nbspCovid-19. Just 10 days earlier, Shulepov recorded a video with fellow paramedic Alexander Kosyakin. In the widely shared clip, the two ambulance workers are seen complaining about lack of protective equipment and, in Shulepov’s case, allegedly being forced to work with an active coronavirus infection.Kosyakin was later summoned by police and cautioned about spreading “fake news” about Covid-19, a criminal offence under Russian law. Shulepov would in time\u0026nbspretract the video, saying that he had recorded it in “an emotional state”.It is impossible to know what might have gone on in Shulepov’s mind or on the ward that caused him to fall out of a window. But foul play would on balance seem unlikely: a first-floor window is not the most effective way to do away with an opponent without leaving a trace. It will likely be many weeks, if ever, before we get clarity about the affair. Both relatives and colleagues said they had been asked not to comment while the investigation is ongoing.Dmitry Belyakov, chair of Russia’s independent ambulance workers’ union\u0026nbspand a working paramedic, said he had no reason to doubt the three incidents were suicides or attempts. But even so, he could not accept the cause of their death was accidental.The system is not set up for people to work normally or honestly, and it provokes incidents such as thisInstead, Belyakov placed the blame firmly at the door of management. Bosses are struggling to cope with an upsurge in Covid-19 across the country, he suggested, and had prioritised relations with their superiors over the wellbeing of staff.“Managers don’t know what to do, so they have taken to scapegoating the middle-rung people,” he said. “Exhausted enough by the pandemic, they are throwing themselves out of windows.”Belyakov said many of his members had contacted him to complain about unrealistic demands and working without\u0026nbspproper protective kit. As a rule, his members have little leverage over working conditions. Most ambulance workers in Moscow are not local, the union activist said, so are beholden to huge debts, rents and mortgage payments, alongside\u0026nbspthe whims of managers. “No one has declared a state of emergency or cancelled repayments,” he added.Other medics\u0026nbspsuggested that the Covid-19 pandemic had simply cast new light on an\u0026nbspage-old problem.\u0026nbspDeaths among medical staff had become more tragic because people were “paying attention,” said Alexei Erlikh, a consultant\u0026nbspcardiologist and\u0026nbsphead of intensive care at Moscow’s Hospital Number 29. “The system is not set up for people to work normally or honestly, and it provokes incidents such as this.”In the absence of official statistics, Erlikh is one of a group of doctors who have taken to compile a “memorial list” of colleagues who have fallen victim\u0026nbspto Covid-19. The list, which includes four medics\u0026nbspfrom neighbouring Belarus,\u0026nbspcurrently stands at 113.\u0026nbspLebedeva and Nepomnyashnaya\u0026nbspstand\u0026nbspat positions 57 and 68 respectively.The doctor said it was inevitable that more doctors, paramedics and nurses would take their lives as the pandemic widens its reach across Russia in the coming weeks and months. Moscow is one story, he said when the virus properly hits the regions, things are only likely to get uglier.“There you have lack of protective clothing and equipment on one hand, and lack of expertise and organisational capacity on another,” he said. “Add in the secrecy of provincial Russia as you move away from Moscow, and you have all the ingredients for a perfect storm.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most. But we also need you to do your bit too.The Journalists’ Charity has been helping journalists through tough times for more than  years.

He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes. I’m out.”I’d got no closer to understanding Joe’s astonishing popularity, though, which is truly global.Over , people log in just to stare at his fairly spartan living room, every Monday to Friday.Hundreds of thousands more appear when Joe starts his  minutes of physical jerks.So, in an attempt to unlock the greatest mystery of the outbreak, I kept watching Joe and swtly came to the conclusion success was not linked to his presenting skills.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Because, for a host, he has a strangely distracted and chaotic air about him, with sessions regularly being interrupted by technical issues, forgetfulness and tiny daughter Indie, who charged in, dressed as Zog the dragon, on Friday.He’s not the greatest multitasker either, as Joe often demonstrates with the geography quiz he’s introduced to jolly things along.“What is the capital city of Moscow. . .   No. I mean Russia.”He also has to believe me when I tell him he’s not one of le’s natural comedians.“What’s the capital of Cuba  Fray Bentos. Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done. Sit-ups.He may not be Emily Maitlis , but he’s the irrepressible and lucky optimist telling us to get off our fat a***s when we need to hear it most.He’s temporarily indisposed at the moment, of course.A gammy arm means we Rosie is leading the workouts.But I was firmly of the opinion nothing and no one could ever stand in the way of world domination, until I tuned into Sunday night’s Diva On Lockdown and there was Gemma Collins trying to contort her mighty bulk into one of Joe’s squats while she bellowed: “I wonder how Joe Wicks would feelhe knew the GC was doing his workout ”Beaten, I’d imagine.He must never know.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.And her face is glued to the back of her head.So there will be hell to payit comes unstuck on The Real Marigold Hotel, where the only other one of the eight celebs who’s appeared looking as unearthly as Britt is former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, whose hair is now a “vibrant and colourful” shade of roast papaya orange. And will remain that way, until the monsoon breaks.It’s probably safe to say neither of them will be hanging around that long, though, or “retiring to India” any time soon.This is the fourth series of the BBC show and not one of the famous pensioners has given the place a second look yet.They have, however, all come home alive.So I wish the Beeb would count its lucky stars, cut the pretence, make Duncan pay for everyone’s holiday and let us all enjoy their discomfort, which is considerable and very entertaining.During the first episode: John “Nasty Nick” Altman proved as supple as Tower Bridge at his first ever yoga lesson.Paul Chuckle remained confined to barracks with the trots.Henry “Blowers” Blofeld rejected insect repellent on the grounds that: “Mosquitoes get p***edthey bite me.”And actress Susie Blake certainly didn’t hold back when the local foot doctor told her: “You have some unwanted growths.”“Yes, I have haemorrhoids.”Susie, too much inflammation.Jamie Redknapp: “We always used to turn up late but somehow we’d make it in time.Martin Keown: “Vieira was the best I ever played with. But Henry was a great player, so don’t make me choose between them.”Paul Merson: “The secret to working hard is to work hard.”ON one particularly fraught episode of her Channel  show, last week, Steph McGovern was forced to let a wasp out of her living room window, live on air.Probably halving her audience in the process.A day later it was announced the show itself was being released back into the wild, or as they put it “taking a break”.Credit for this development was being given to Steph’s long-suffering neighbours, who’d objected to the disruption the production had caused and may yet get a Bafta fellowship for their intervention.Truth be told, though, Steph’s “power hour of positivity” was more likely killed by worthiness, lack of content, technical issues and the host herself, who’s a rotten interviewer, kills every good joke stone dead, has the same set response to everythingand a terrible habit of asking exactly the wrong question.“Martin , what are you doing with all that toilet paper ” “Errr . . . ”There’s talk of a brave new dawn, in a shiny Leeds studio, later this year and when I last checked, author Marian Keyes was giving some pointed advice on how to become a good novelist: “Your first efforts will be woefully appalling.

Our formerly thriving economy is on its knees, losing billions a day. Huge numbers of jobs have been lost, many permanently.Matt Hancock’s new “track and trace” app may prove a great addition to the armoury against Covid- and we urge every Sun reader to download and use it when available. But we cannot wait for such tactics to bear fruit in the statistics.We are past the peak. Deaths are on their way down. The NHS was nowhere near being overwhelmed and that looks increasingly unlikely.The Government must not be swayed by the lockdown’s continued public support. That will evaporate once the long-term economic consequences sink in.We strongly disagree, though, with those who never thought it necessary — and make spurious comparisons of our death totals against countries of very dferent sizes and population densities.And we know what a tough call this is. But easing us imminently back to work and school, using social distancing and masks, is the right one. Yes, an NHS unable to cope would be a catastrophe.An even greater one is a prolonged lockdown . . . and a nation engulfed by bankruptcies, unemployment and poverty.WHAT a golden excuse the lockdown has been for every bossy busybody to exercise their authoritarian urges.Even so, we never imagined anyone would be mean-spirited enough to moan about the weekly clap for our ­carers — let alone for local councils to act on such petty grievances.One, however, has issued a warning to tone down the applause and Vera Lynn songs after a single complaint.

If Boris Johnson is to get our flatlining economy going again, he and his Government must prove to the public that lockdown restrictions can be lted sensibly and safely.And that’s where homemade masks come in. Yes, we know they’re not perfect. But mounting evidence proves that insisting on their use in confined spaces can help slow the spread of the virus, and — crucially — they lend confidence.One way or another, it’s becoming crystal clear that after lockdown Britain will be very dferent from the country we remember. Gone are the days of a post-work pint in the pub to wind down:ministers permit us to socialise, it will be only for picnics, and only with those we consider our close friends.But with the economy on its knees, we must throw everything we’ve got at creating a “new normal” to tide us over until a vaccine can be found.Andmasks are part of that, then let’s get Britain sewing.OFFICIALS must stop hiding behind corona-jargon and start explaining in plain English exactly what they want from us.Guidance states thatyou’re classed as “extremely clinically vulnerable” you’re supposed to “shield”, andyou’re considered “clinically vulnerable” you should be “closely following social distancing rules”.The problem is thatyou’re over  and not in the habit of scrutinising government websites, you may understandably not know what the dference between those terms is.

This was after she said she had cancer and was a domestic violence victim, and she just put it up for sale on Facebook.Another came to us saying shed got no baby milk so we gave her three tubs and they were spotted on Facebook, shed put the three tubs up for £. They were snapped up as its really expensive, usually £ a tub.Weve got bikers going out to families with donations who are supposed to be in desperate need. But one family was taking delivery of a brand new television, right as he got there with our delivery.Its throwing it back in the faces of people who have donated.

I am , so when I joined the workforce we were in the midst of a financial crisis that plunged the economy into paralysis.I have endured years of political to-ing and fro-ing over spending, infrastructure projects and — whether you voted for it or not — Westminster’s tortuous Brexit chicanery that has slowed down economic growth.The price  Real wages, measured alongside inflation, only got back above their  levels this year.House prices shot up to unaffordable levels, with governments promising to build the houses we need but failing miserably to take on the vested interests that stand in the way.Young people could already only dream of owning a home before the world shut down.Just this week, a friend sent round a story on WhatsApp about the possibility of house prices collapsing.We all just laughed and agreed we still could not get anywhere near a deposit, and not because we have been enjoying too much avocado toast.And just as we looked forward to a British bounce once Brexit was in the rear-view mirror, now a global pandemic has made  look like nothing more than a trailer for the main event in which this young generation, yet again, gets a starring role.It is not just about getting money moving and business booming, either.The temporary schemes introduced by the Government to get people through the worst of this crisis will leave a borrowing pile that not even Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell could have dreamed up.Most likely, that means higher taxes and lower spending for decades. In short, Britain’s under-s are being condemned to years of an economy going backwards.So it is time for them to be allowed back to work and start the recovery. We should all be invested in British companies’ success.The better they do, the more jobs they create, the more they can pay, the better le is. Yes, there is a risk to getting the young back to work.But witness the orderly queues outside supermarkets and the pavement shuffle dance that we have all perfected to give each other space.The public, young and old, understand the threat of this virus.We invented all these video apps everyone is now socialising on.

The strength lies in looking at data from  countries.Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, also expressed his concerns over the data.He said: The researchers have obtained their data on numbers of cases and deaths from a reputable standard source, but that source collects and collates data from inidual countries.There have been many concerns that deaths and cases are being counted in dferent ways in dferent countries.This could affect the conclusions from the modelling.But the academics did agree that the findings could be useful when it comes to policymaking - providing there is more scientic-backing.Dr Joshua Moon, of the science policy research unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said: This study would indicate that mask-wearing and stay-at-home orders could be the first to be relaxed, then others come later in a more staged approach.This should be coupled with intense testing, tracing, and isolating to ensure that transmission is minimised.But the vast majority of the population have taken to voluntary social distancing as usage of public transport has dropped signicantly and large numbers are working from home.The academic argued Britains lockdown strategy “only pushes the severe cases into the future” and has not prevented them, Prof Giesecke added.He said: “There is very little we can do to prevent this spread: a lockdown might delay severe cases for a while, but once restrictions are eased, cases will reappear.”Despite resisting strict lockdown measures, Sweden’s Public Health Institute estimated that the country’s R number, the number of people each infected person passes the virus to, fell from . at the start of April to . at the end of the month.Professor Giesecke has previously been critical of the pandemic modelling produced by the Imperial College London team led by Professor Neil Ferguson.He suggested Professor Ferguson’s projected death tolls were too pessimistic and rejected suggestions that Sweden will see a mounting mortality rate, saying in a Swedish newspaper interview: “On the contrary, I think it will go down.”Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it was a bad policy judgement.They could have used university labs, more NHS labs and others much sooner.Professor Pennington said the levels of new cases in the UK needed to be ten times lower to make a meaningful dference.Yesterday there were , new cases of the virus - but the Government has been quick to explain case numbers are higher because of higher numbers of testing.Professor Pennington said: At the moment we are past the peak, but not on a signicantly downward trend, the virus is at a sort of a plateau just below the peak.He said one of the biggest problems facing the UK over the next few months would be people coming into the country.Heathrow Airport are currently trialing thermal imaging cameras to check passengers for coronavirus.Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said yesterday the UK needed to work on an international common standard of coronavirus screening to allow the aviation sector to get back on its feet - and to keep new cases out.But Professor Pennington was not convinced screening measures were enough.He said: I am sceptical this will work well enough because you will miss half of those infected because of theperiod of the virus when people may not be showing symptoms.And he added: We also cant wait for a vaccine.

But the country managed to stop the virus in its tracks with a hardline system of mass testing, contact tracing, isolation and surveillance. To date, South Korea has had fewer than  deaths from the virus. Former minister Greg Clarke, who chairs the Commons science committee, said the decision to reject South Korea’s approach “may be one of the most pivotal decisions made in this pandemic.” He added it was “regrettable and concerning that this evidence is being withheld from the committee”, despite senior officials promising to provide it in March. On March , Public Health England had told the committee it would publish the evidence “in the next few days”. Last week, they wrote to the committee, saying: “The Royal Society have agreed to prioritise research that will aim to understand the dferent approaches to testing and impact on Rand to identy lessons learned from other countries.” But Mr Clarke replied: “The Committee asked in the evidence session on  March and in the subsequent follow- up letter for the evidence that had informed Public Health England’s prior decision to take a dferent approach to testing than that followed by South Korea and other countries, not a retrospective analysis conducted now of dferent countries’ approaches to testing. “On  March you indicated in evidence that PHE would publish the evidence base and rationale for adopting this dferent approach “in the next few days”. In a Downing Street press briefing yesterday, deputy chief scientic adviser Professor Dame Angela McLean said ministers should look to South Korea as a fine example and emulate their policy.

The country had its first confirmed coronavirus case on January , nine days before the UK reported its first case in York. South Korea took quick action to slow the spread of the Sars-Cov- coronavirus. Private labs were opened up to allow rapid testing and the country instituted drive-through testing centres, allowing quicker identication of those who were infected but not displaying symptoms. By the end of February, the country was testing more than , people a day. Positive cases were followed with extensive contract tracing, and a central tracking app, Corona m, was used to inform citizens of known cases within  metres. Officials also began screening all people arriving at airports when the number of new cases spiked in mid-March. By early April, nearly , people had been tested and officials last week said there were no new domestic cases. Rapid testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of South Koreaaposs strategy. Swt action helped officials identy those who were infected but asymptomatic, and rigorous quarantine measures were put in place to keep infection rates low. Even when the disease was spreading, South Korea did not go into a full lockdown, with people still allowed to go to work. The country has recorded  deaths associated with coronavirus while the UK passed , on Tuesday. South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha said in a recent Covid- taskforce meeting that testing was absolutely critical in stemming the spread of the virus. The Korean Centre for Disease Control has subsequently relaxed some of its social distancing guidelines and is expected to ease more restrictions in coming days. Prof McLean said: It is a large country like we are. They did have quite a big outbreak, actually, that they brought under control with contact tracing. I think they are a fine example to us and we should try to emulate what they have achieved. Ministers abandoned contact tracing on March  as the virus spread beyond control in the community, but with the spread coming under control after the lockdown was imposed on March , the approach will be revived to help ease restrictions.

But in an unusual move for a government expert, National Statistician Professor Sir Ian Diamond gave his apospersonal viewapos on plans to ease social distancing measures.Interjecting at the end of the briefing, where he flanked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, he said: All the data that we are looking at shows the success of social distancing.AndI may give a personal view then I do believe that social distancing and maintaining it over the next few weeks is going to be central to continuing reducing the epidemic. The Office for National Statistics chief said Professor John Edmunds was right that the infection rate - R - had probably gone up in the past fortnight. That is driven by the epidemic in care homes, he would say and I would not demur from that, Sir Ian told the Downing Street press conference. That gives us a real challenge to reduce the epidemic in care homes and itaposs one that I think - over the next few weeks from what I see happening - will happen. He said that at the moment we need, certainly, to get on top of the epidemic in care homes and in hospitals but in the community we have things relatively low at the moment. It came after Mr Raab said any short term changes would be modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored.”  Mr Raab told the Downing Street press conference: The virus is not beaten yet, it remains deadly and infectious.He confirmed Boris Johnson will use an address on Sunday to set out the roadmap to easing the lockdown.  This weekend the Prime Minister will set out the next steps which we can responsibly take over the following weeks, guided by the scientic advice and mindful - as we said right from the word go - of taking the right decisions at the right time. Now we can start setting out how we will live and work whilst maintaining the necessary social distancing rules, we can also be clear about those measures which are still necessary to prevent a second peak. He went on to describe this as very delicate and a very dangerous moment. The PM told todayaposs Cabinet that “in considering whether there could be any easement in the existing guidelines, that we are not going to do anything that risks a second peak”, his spokesman said. Mr Johnson told ministers: We will advance with maximum caution in order to protect the NHS and save lives. We will be guided at every step by the science and the data and we will closely track the impact of any easing of the social distancing measures and will not hesitate to tighten the rulesrequired.

During his time as the partyaposs Brexit spokesperson and in the leadership campaign Mr Starmer was reluctant to criticise Mr Corbyn - who remained extremely popular among the partyaposs membership.But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Starmer, who won the leadership on a landslide, said Mr Corbyn was the main issue which came up when he went to more than  constituencies where he knocked on doors and spoke to campaign teams.“The topic of conversation was always what was coming up . . . anybody who knocks on doors knows a number of things came up,” he said. “The leadership of Labour party was number one, fair or unfair,” Sir Keir told the FT Magazine.Mr Starmer said the partyaposs programme for government was also an issue with voters turned off by the “overload” of Labour’s manesto. This was a common complaint at the time with many MPs who said that the electorate saw the plan - which included proposals to nationalise several industries, hand £bn of shares to workers, and plans for an extra £bn a year of tax and spending - was unworkable.  “People thought there was too much in it and because there was too much in it they didn’t believe any of it,” Mr Starmer told the FT.  Mr Starmer has already distanced himself from the previous administration by sacking a number of those close to Jeremy Corbyn including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett and instead promoting those on the so-called soft left. But policy-wise so far the sht is more subtle with hints at a more social democratic rather than purely socialist agenda despite the retention of some of the radical language of the Corbyn era. He told the FT: The levels of inequality . . . are now so deeply ingrained that only transformative change is going to do something about it.From the coronavirus to Brexit, this is an era of great change and uncertainty.

Hundreds of people are still dying each day from coronavirus. But now that weaposre past the peak, Boris Johnson will lay out a roadmap at pm on Sunday  May for how lockdown will be eased. He will change very little immediately - and wonapost end lockdown in one go. But some changes will take effect from Monday  Maypossible. And in the long term, his plan will give us a clearer picture of what the UK will look like over the coming months in a new, coronavirus-scarred world. The Mirror understands a draft -page plan has been drawn up to get the country back to normal. The Governmentaposs blueprint aims to to relax the lockdown in staggered steps between now and October.  Schools and outdoor activities are set to resume within weeks, while pubs and restaurants look doomed to stay closed for months. Meanwhile the furlough scheme will be wound down after June, fines for breaching lockdown will rise, and you could be told to cover your face in public. So what will reopen, what will stay shut - and how will your everyday le change  Weaposve explained the timeline and all the main proposals below.for the Mirror Politics newsletter at www.mirror email -at .am to navigate the day ahead.When will lockdown end  The Prime Minister will lay out his roadmap for ending lockdown on Sunday  May. He will give an address to the nation at pm, with more details and a Parliamentary statement to follow on Monday. Some measures will be lted as early as Monday  Maywe possibly can - but they will only be very limited and lockdown will not end all in one go.Experts say some closures or social distancing will last until , when weaposre likely to have a vaccine. Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned: Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine, then I suspect we’re going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus. Meanwhile, the legal date to review the lockdown is Thursday  May. That review will keep restrictions in place - but no detail will be announced on that day.  Will we be given specic dates  This seems unlikely. The Irish government has spelt out five phases each with a target date between May and August. But while Downing Street hasnapost denied using phases, they probably wonapost have a specic date. Instead Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “What we’ll have to do as we make changes is monitor the impact those changes are having upon the R rate in particular. “And once we have that information, we’ll obviously be able to judgeand when we’re in a position to go further.”  What are the proposed dates  According to a draft plan seen by the Mirror, from the start of June, primary schools in England would have a phased . Households could also be allowed to expand their “social bubble” to one other household of family or friends. At the end of June, secondary schools would , some outdoor activities and cafes. Then, pubs and restaurants could reopen at the end of August or early September. The final stage of lting restrictions, which could include the opening of gyms and and theof fans to Premier League matches, is the least predictable. Earmarked for October, it is being fiercely debated, amid fears of a second wave of Covid- or a flu outbreak. The Sun reports gyms face being closed for most of , while playgrounds are also poised to stay shut. . From Monday Unlimited exercise allowed. Employees to be encouraged toto workplaces that have stayed open through- out the lockdownsafe. Garden centres could reopen while there may be more guidance on the use of outdoor spaces including open-air markets, high streets and cemeteries. . End of May Start of June Phasedof primary schools in England, starting with Year . Households could be allowed to expand “social bubble” to meet one other household of family or friends. . JunePhasedof secondary schools in England before the summer holidays. Small team sports such as five-a-side football could be allowed, along with outdoor gatherings of fewer than  people. Cafes with outdoor seating could reopen while outdoor sports like golf, tennis and angling might resume. Possibleof Premier League matches, although behind closed doors. . End of August Start of September Pubs, bars and restaurants could gradually reopen although customers would be expected to follow strict social distancing rules. . October Possibleof football fans to matches. Gyms could be allowed to re-open. But any further lting of restrictions to get back to normal le would be in doubt amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus or an outbreak of seasonal flu. What will the roadmap talk about  It will spell out how the lockdown changes in phases over time. It may have a traffic light system spelling out what you can and canapost do as restrictions lt. The plan would also drop the governmentaposs stay at home branding in favour of a more subtle message. But it will also make clear that the UK is not ing to business as usual. Some restrictions will be eased, but others - like fines for breaches - will be made harsher than they are now. While people are put back on public transport and in some workplaces, there will be strict social distancing to keep people two metres apart. People are likely to be advised to cover their faces, and will be told to use an NHS phone app that alerts youyouaposve come into close contact with the virus.  How does the R number, apostest, track and traceapos and five tests come into all this  The aposRapos number is the average number of people infected by each Covid- carrier. It has to be low enough for each stage of the roadmap to begin. Currently R is between . and . because so many people are out of contact with each other. Every time you relax a lockdown rule, R rises again. Ministers say they wonapost do anything that pushes the R number back above . The UK must also pass five tests before easing lockdown:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHSTo help pass all these tests there is a apostest, track and traceapos strategy planned for launch at the middle of May. It will mean downloading an NHS app which tells youyouaposve been near a Covid- carrier - and ensuring you isolate quicklyyouaposre put at risk to stop it spreading further. More on this below. So what will the plan say   Schools Schools will reopen in a phased way - with some year groups likely to go back first while others are told to remain at home. Boris Johnson has signalled he wants primary schools to be the first to , and it is likely that Year  will be the first to . Years  and  would then be the first back in secondary schools, according to one plan. Priority could also be put on pupils with special educational needs. Teachers need time to put social distancing in place, including reorganising classrooms to keep children  metres apart. Sources suggest this will begin as early as June . No declined to sayall pupils will be back before September. Universities Arts students will be the last to , with students of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science prioritised in the autumn, according to the Sunday Times. Thirty-three universities are working on a contingency plan to fast-track students of the key sciences back to campus.  Public transport The number of trains will slowly rise as lockdown eases, to avoid overcrowding. Hand sanitiser and one-way systems would be placed on the network, with spacing at s and bus stops “clearly marked out” to keep people two metres apart. New timetables will be introduced as planned in May, even though trains will not run to them straight away. Firms would be urged to stagger workersapos start times to spread out the rush out. But London mayor Sadiq Khan has warned capacity could be overwhelmed. A double decker London bus would have to have just  passengers. Meanwhile the government has hinted at more support for Cycle to Work, a tax break scheme where you can buy a bicycle over a year through your employer.  Workplaces and working from home Workplaces would have floor markings to ensure people are two metres apart, according leaked draft guidance. The guidance could also recommend staggered arrival times and breaks, fewer people in lts and regular deep cleaning. According to BuzzFeed News, other draft measures for workplaces include:Providing additional parking or bike racks Having more entrances into the workplace Alternatives to touch-based security devices such as keypads Washing unorms on site rather than at home Reducing maximum occupancy for lts, providing hand sanitiser for the operation of lts and encouraging use of stairs Introducing more one-way flow routes through buildings Reviewing layouts to allow staff to work further apart from each otherBut workers would in some cases be allowed to sit less than two metres apart - despite the risk being  to  times higher at one metre than two metres. Not all workers would go back to the officethey donapost need to. Government advisors have previously said working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine for coronavirus.The furlough scheme At the moment, .m workers are having their wages paid by the state - up to % or £, a month. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned this is not sustainable because it costs as much as the NHS. The furlough scheme runs in full up to the end of June and will then be wound down. Officials appear to be looking at cutting the amount to workers and the self-employed or limiting it only to certain sectors. This has sparked fears some will lose out. The future of the furlough scheme wonapost be announced on Sunday. Sources said it would be in the week or two weeks after the PMaposs address on Sunday. Picnics, golf course, tennis and going outdoors People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, drive to the countryside and have picnics, according to the Mail on Sunday. And the Daily Mail claims golf courses, tennis courts and fishing lakes will reopen from June too. Youaposd still have to be with members of your own household only, and keep two metres away from other groups.  No has not confirmed these reports. But ministers and scientists have repeatedly said outdoor activities are less risky than those indoors - indicating theyaposll be the first to be allowed back.  Supermarkets Supermarkets would doubtless keep many of the social distancing measures theyaposve already put in place. And opening hours could be increased on Sunday to reduce overcrowding. Boris Johnson has said heaposs looking at relaxing Sunday trading laws to reduce queues on the weekend.  Building sites Building sites were never told to close under lockdown guidance - as long as two metres could be kept between workers. So the government is expected to make a renewed push for people toto work there. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said because the risk of the virus outdoors is lower than indoors, there’s “more scope” for some jobs outside. He added: “Thereaposs more scope for people ing to work on building sites for example, or more outdoor leisure activities than is likely to be the case for indoor ones.”  aposBubblesapos of up to  people People could meet small bubbles of their friends and family under one idea to ease the coronavirus lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was looking at the proposal as one possible way to relax restrictions on peopleaposs movement in the future. But she warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. That means people would have to choose one bubble of friends or family - and stick with them, while continuing not to meet other people they love. Reports later said the idea was one being mulled by the UK government. But itaposs not set in stone.  Fines for breaching lockdown The government is considering raising the penalty for defying lockdown from £ to £ for a first offence. The fines would then double for each offence after that, just as they do already. And the maximum fine would rise from just under £, at the moment to £,. A senior government source did not deny these figures, reported by the Sunday , were under consideration. Covering your face The government hasnapost made a final decision on whether to ask people to cover their face in public. However, some kind of face covering advice is widely expected after Boris Johnson covering oneaposs face in some situations would be a useful tool. Itaposs understood thatface coverings are required, they wonapost be masks. The government doesnapost want to cause a shortage in personal protective equipment that should be available to the NHS. But coverings like a scarf could be recommended. And the government would provide guidance on what kind of material you can make such a covering from. Itaposs important that people donapost end up fiddling with their face covering in a way that means theyaposre actually creating more risk, by continually touching their face.  Using a new app A new contact tracing app is expected to launch in around mid-May after trials on the Isle of Wight this week. The app, which is voluntary, will use Bluetooth to track when people have come into close contact with someone who, now or later, tests positive for coronavirus. It will urge someone who’s been in contact with a virus carrier to get tested and to isolate themselvesnecessary. It is part of the crucial “test, track and trace” strategy that is needed before the UK-wide lockdown can be relaxed. The idea is that this would allow society to partially reopen while keeping the virus at bay and sick people in isolation. For it to work properly, at least % or so of the population need to download it. It will be paired with an army of , human contact tracers to follow up on those who need further attention, or those who don’t download the app.  Arriving in the UK Ministers are actively looking at quarantining people who arrive into the UK once lockdown begins to ease. Nothing is confirmed, but reports have suggested people will be asked to isolate themselves for two weeks. If so, this would be a major blow to the airline industry and render most holidays to Britain pointless. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: I think it’s important... that we ensure the sacrices in the sense of social distancing that we’re asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. So I am actively looking at these issues right now. So that when we have infection rates within the country under control, weaposre not importing. Local lockdowns The government is considering new wave of local lockdown restrictions later this year to stop new spikes of coronavirus in their tracks. At the moment, officials are focused on easing the lockdown at the same pace across the UK - to move as one nation in the Covid- crisis. But itaposs understood officials are looking at changing that approachthere is a rapid new second outbreak of the virus, which needs quick action to be halted. A government source said: If you were to see worrying increases of transmission happening in regions, then you would want to move quickly to try and stop those.  Pubs, grassroots sport, mass gatherings and other venues Pubs will be the last places to reopen as lockdown is eased, the Government has confirmed. Likewise, ministers have indicated that mass gatherings will be among the last things to reopen. But some local cricket and grassroots football could– as long as spectators can stay in the open air. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries said: “Outdoor environments are safer. Butyou go with a load of friends and sit in a pub… that’s not a good thing to do.” And Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the No coronavirus update: “Transmission is signicantly less outdoors than indoors.” Meanwhile hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. Courts Courts might have to use two courtrooms where we would have used one in the past, so that jurors can retire into a safe space and also be spaced out and distanced within the court. People are also measuring courtrooms - often a cramped environment - to work out what would be safe. And the number of people on juries could be reduced. A aposone UKapos approach Scotland and Wales have repeatedly set out plans ahead of, or slightly dferently to, the rest of the UK government. And itaposs true that the Scottish and Welsh governments have control over areas like schools and care homes. However, ministers have also stressed they want to keep the whole of the UK moving in the same way at the same time. And the government has distanced itself from claims that worst-hit regions, like London and the West Midlands, could have dferent rules to the countryside. NHS services Some routine operations and fertility treatment have already been restored as hospital inpatients fall for several weeks in a row. However, itaposs not yet clear when other services - including ENT therapies and dentistry, where staff are particularly at risk of transmission - will continue.

Violet Davies-Evans - who was the third oldest person in the country - lived through  prime ministers, five monarchs and survived both world wars. She was just one day younger than the the two oldest people in the UK - who share the birth date of March , . Violet, of Vi as she was known to her family, had lived independently up until the age of  before moving into Ashwood Nursing Home, in Spalding, Lincs., in . She died peacefully in her sleep at the care home on Tuesday. Violet was born in Sutterton, Lincs., only seven years after the death of Queen Victoria and the year the boy scout movement was founded. She credited her longevity with keeping her brain active by playing Scrabble and doing daily cryptic crosswords in the newspaper. Throughout her le, she would never wash her face, preferring cleansing creams which kept her skin looking younger. Violet also rubbed shoulders with the rich and famous after becoming a beauty specialist for Elizabeth Arden – founder of the renowned cosmetics company. Nephew Mike Lawton, , said her aunt was “definitely a real character” and at times a cross between Hyacinth Bucket from Keeping Up Appearances and actress Joan Sanderson. He said: “My we was a little overawed at first when we would go there for tea because Vi would have china tea cups and used tongs to get the cubes of sugar.  “She was once taken shopping to Peterborough by a friend and they ended up with quite a few bags between them. ‘Get a porter,’ she said. “So in some respects Vi was almost from a dferent era. But she was a smiling and joyful lady who liked socialising and eating out and loved to sing. “Vi was very lucid until quite recently and enjoyed talking to the staff at Ashwood, who were so kind to her. She was happy to move in there as it seemed like a hotel.” After a first job at drapery and haberdashery store Violet began working in London for Elizabeth Arden and had several well-to-do clients. Violetmarried her talented and well-respected teacher husband Hubert in  and together they enjoyed a busy social le with famous people as friends.  At the start of World War Two, Elizabeth Arden offered Violet the relative safety of a job in America but her employee turned it down, preferring to stay in Marble Arch. Mike added: “Vi felt she had a job to do here and went on to fire-watch on the roof tops in London. At that point, her day job was personal assistant to Chris Hintonin the Ministry of Supply. Mike said during one hotel stay for a conference, a man burst in on Violet as she was having a soak in the communal bathroom. She quickly grabbed her towel and put it over her head. Mike added: “I asked her why she didn’t cover her body She replied: ‘Because I would have met him the next day and I didn’t want him to remember my face’. “She had a good sense of fun.”  Mike said his aunt had a signicant influence on his le, helping to shape his behaviour and outlook as a teenager. He added: “Vi was formative in my le. She and my uncle bought eight acres of land with a bungalow on in Oxfordshire. I would spend all my summer holidays there. “I can remember going toAlastair Sim’s on a Sunday morning for cocktails with George Cole. Spalding in the s was fairly parochial so to suddenly be able to mix with those kind of people was really quite something.” When Hubert died in , Violet moved back to Lincolnshire, first living with her widowed sister May in Osbournby. When she later moved to Spalding, Mike and we Claire would visit regularly from their home in Warrington, taking her a month’s supply of frozen meals. Violet also had a penchant for red wine and even up to and beyond  years old she would order a case from specialist Laithwaite’s.

The trio, alongside actress Lisa Faulkner and comedian Mark Watson, revealed the small things they are doing to cut their energy use as people spend more time at home. These include baking cakes in the microwave instead of the oven, not leaving devices on charge unnecessarily, and encouraging aposenergy-freeapos time during the day. Batch cooking and cleaning the coils at the back of your fridge are also among the great ways to save energy, according to the celeb videos - released as part of the Smart Energy GB initiative on how to be more mindful of their energy use. Nature presenter Chris Packham is using his time at home to clean, in a bid to improve the energy efficiency of his house. to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every eveningHe said: Iaposve done all the cleaning jobs which will also help my home be more energy efficient as our usage has inevitably increased. Vacuuming the back of the radiators and cleaning behind the fridge help. The coils get all fluffy and this means the fridge has to work harder, in turn using more energy. It may be a small gain, but everything counts, and it was so satisfying.I also have an office set up in my living room because it has plenty of natural light. Thanks to the sunny weather, and the fact that the days are starting to get longer, I donapost need to turn any lights on.Presenter Helen Skelton has turned to energetic dancing to warm up the whole family when it gets chilly and has also ditched her hairdryer and straighteners - in favour of the aposau naturalapos look.  Helen said: When the weather turned cold and wet last week, it was easy to turn on the heating to warm up. But instead, we decided to try and warm up by getting the jumpers out of the wardrobe. We also keep moving - assault courses in the house and gymnastics classes in the lounge so the kids donapost turn the heating on. But Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington has been keeping her young daughter entertained by making cakes - but rather than heating up the oven, she has tried out the microwave to save both time and energy. Adlington, like the  per cent of those in the UK who have used the device to track spending and reduce their energy consumption, said: Something weaposve found really useful is our smart meter.  We all know our energy will be increasing during this time, butyou have one already, it can help you to keep a track on things. As a household weaposre trying to do energy free time. During the week, weaposve introduced TV free time between  and pm and weaposre trying to do this at the weekend too - filling our time with other activities like jigsaws, board games, exercising and dancing using a dferent energy. Actress Lisa Faulkner has been putting her cooking skills to good use, by batch cooking meals - finding it is much more energy efficient than creating frequent small meals. She said: I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, even more so lately, and this has really challenged me to think how I can make recipes go a long way. This has led to me being even more creative with how I cook for the family.  Iaposve found it much more energy efficient than cooking lots of small meals and I have nearly a whole weekaposs worth of Bolognese that I can turn into three dferent meals - a chilli, soup and of course pasta Bolognese. Meanwhile, funny man Mark Watson is making sure to only charge his phone and laptop when needed. He said: Iaposm an absolute nightmare for keeping my phone and laptop at  per cent battery. It only needs to get to  per cent and I get tense. So Iaposm one of those people who charge my devices for absolutely hours and hours, asit was possible to get to about  per cent. Really, they only ever need a couple of hours charge. Thereaposs no need to be on permanent charge and itaposs using unnecessary energy.  Other tips from the celebrities also included doing one big wash rather than lots of small ones, only boiling as much water as you need in the kettle - and remembering to turn the extractor fan off after youaposve used it. Cleaning the filters in your washers and dryers also ensure they run more energy efficiently. Robert Cheesewright, from Smart Energy GB, said: In these circumstances, weaposre inevitably using more energy around the home than usual. So, we want to encourage everyone to share their tips and advice on the easy and cost-effective ways to be more energy efficient at home - as it might help others out with how they cut down on their consumption.

Stress levels are highest for those living with children, but levels were noticeably lower for those living in urban areas. The findings, released by scientists at University College London, come as Boris Johnson pans to unveil details of how his government will ease lockdown restrictions. Dr Daisy Fancourt, of UCL Epidemiology  Health Care and study leader, said: “Over the past week we have seen stress levels rise and the slight improvement in well-being we had seen since lockdown started has plateaued as discussions around an exit have begun. “Stress about unemployment remains relatively stable, with around one in  people worried about their future.” For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  But itaposs not all bad news. The data also revealed that happiness was slowly ing to pre-Covid levels as the country adjusts to lockdown le. One in six were worried about finances, particularly those who were under-, people with children and those on lower incomes. The findings were based on survey of , adults.  The lockdown has previously been blamed for a rise in excess drinking and increasing issues with mental health. Stress can be a big trigger for drinking. Combine that with the added pressures and boredom of lockdown, and itaposs not surprising we might find ourselves reaching for a drink more often, according to Dr Richard Piper of Alcohol Change UK . He added it was concerning that one in five of us are drinking more frequently when those who were heavier drinkers before lockdown seem to be more likely to fall into this camp. Boris Johnson will set out his “roadmap” on Sunday, and said the first steps will happen the next day “ we possibly can”. The Mirror understands a draft -page plan has been drawn up to get the country back to normal. The Governmentaposs blueprint aims to to relax the lockdown in staggered steps between now and October.

TThe Welsh Cabinet met on Thursday morning and was due to meet again in the evening to discuss the restrictions, which have been in force since March .#xCIt is crucially important that the people of Wales are informed clearly and accurately about what,any, changes are made to the current stay-at-home restrictions,#xD a Welsh Government spokesman said. #xCSome of the reporting in today#xs newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK. #xCThe First Minister of Wales will announce the outcome of the Cabinet#xs decision in due course.#xD He said the message for the bank holiday weekend remained to #xCstay home, protect the NHS, save lives#xD.:Not much point in imposing border controls to prevent virus spread, Raab arguesDominic Raab said restrictions or monitoring on travellers arriving in the UK could be considered once the infection rate in the community is under control.

The UK’s leading eating disorder charity has seen demand in calls for support surge by a third. Alex Poulton, , from Leeds is one of . million people in the UK estimated to have an eating disorder. She is currently recovering from bulimia, but feels like the lockdown has put her at risk of lapsing. “I feel like with coronavirus, my safety blanket has been taken away”, she tells . “You feel bad because a lot of people are in worse situations, and you just want to go to the shops to buy loads of crap food to binge on. It makes you feel awful as a person.” Alex is no longer in therapy and treatment, but before the pandemic she was considering seeking counselling again. But with resources stretched thin across healthcare services in the UK, she feels like there is no point. “With everything happening, I just feel like there is no chance of me getting help anywhere.” Lizzie*, , has been receiving treatment for an eating disorder for over six years, and has been struggling particularly with limited food choice in supermarkets since people began stockpiling. “Weaposve got enough food at home but itaposs hard finding the right food and the right brands that I feel safe with. Itaposs dficult,” she said.  “Thereaposs just so much emphasis at the moment on food, in the newspapers with images of supermarkets and everyone talking about it.” Claire*, , from Surrey, described how the lockdown has exacerbated existing strain on her eating disorder recovery because she feels like her daily routines have been thrown off course. The desire for excessive control is a common symptom of a number of eating disorders. “At the time that coronavirus started, I was focusing on my recovery again after a particularly bad relapse. I have had to move back into my family home and am now struggling again. “The loss of control around food and exercise, along with the idea that gaining weight during the lockdown is inevitable, has really got to me”, Claire said. Beat, the UK’s leading eating disorder charity, has reported a % rise in demand for their helpline services, while struggling with a % drop in income. Hope Virgo, an eating disorder campaigner who is in active recovery for anorexia, has also seen an increase in people looking online for much needed support. She has received hundreds of messages from people struggling to cope with their eating disorder during the pandemic, and especially the lockdown.

The French Army has denied any of its athletes were contaminated at the event held in Wuhan, China, which has since been declared as the epicentre of the pandemic. Reacting to the revelations from numerous French athletes that they ed from the World Military Games with a mystery illness, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces told the countryaposs media as the epidemic linked to Covid- was not known at the time. They added that the French delegation, made up of  people including  athletes benefited from medical checks before and during the games with a dedicated medical team made up of about  people. It said there were declared cases with the army health service of flu or of hospitalisations during or after ing from the games that could be linked, to cases of covid-.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror email  -after the press conference every evening.   Athletes at the World Military Games in coronavirus epicentre Wuhan last October have also been quoted in French media as speculating that they may have brought the virus back home with them. This revelation came after it was discovered that a Frenchman, Amirouche Hammar, , had been infected with the coronavirus in the Paris region as early as December . French media reported that investigations into the origins of the coronavirus revealed there is a possibility it emerged in Wuhan as early as October  when the games took place. A French delegation took part in the th edition of the World Military Games in Wuhan from October  to  - just  days before the first Chinese person officially became ill with coronavirus. There were more than , athletes from all over the world taking part. According to French news channel BFMTV, a number of athletes ed to France with unusual symptoms, including fevers and body aches. The news channel says none of the ing athletes were tested and the French Army, who were responsible for organising their athletes at the military games, reportedly confirmed that they had not wanted to test any athletes either. BFMTV quotes one athlete, who preferred to remain anonymous, as saying that he originally thought he had simply caught a cold.  However, when news began to emerge of an epidemic in Wuhan, many athletes on a WhatsApp group reportedly began to openly wonderit was possible that they had contracted the disease too. Now that it has been revealed that Amirouche Hammar in France had the coronavirus back in December, closer attention is being paid to what these athletes have said. Local media notes that Elodie Clouvel, a world champion modern pentathlete, was asked on local TV channel Television Loire  on March ,she was worried about the prospect of potentially having to spend the summer in Japan for the Olympics. She replied: No because I think that with Velentin [her partner] we have already had the coronavirus, well the covid-. The -year-old added: We were in Wuhan for the World Military Games at the end of October. And afterwards, we all fell ill. Valentin missed three days of training. Me, I was sick too. I had things I had never had before. We werenapost particularly worried because no one was talking about it yet.  She added: A lot of athletes at the World Military Games were very ill. We were recently in touch with a military doctor who told us: aposI think you had it because a lot of people from this delegation were ill.apos Local media report that since she spoke up on March , many athletes have been asked not to answer questions from journalists and to refer media enquiries to the head of communication of the French armies. According to French media, athletes who were in Wuhan reportedly received telephone calls from the army a few weeks ago to reassure them. One of these athletes, who remains anonymous, is quoted as saying: We were told, there is no risk, you left on October , and the virus arrived on November . French media report that sick athletes were also noted in some other delegations, including the Swedish delegation, with people ing to Sweden with strong fevers. But some athletes are sceptical, with Aloise Ratornaz, silver medallist in sailing, telling Ouest-France: I do not think there were any signicant risks of being infected. We lived in isolation during these world games. We had a whole village just for the athletes. She added: We had a restaurant for the athletes where all the food was completely filtered, controlled, in a completely sanitised atmosphere. Professor Eric Caumes, an infectious and tropical disease specialist at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris, said the theory that athletes participating in the World Military Games in Wuhan were contaminated with covid- is completely plausible. Despite the French army strenuously contesting the allegations, prof Caumes has subsequently been quoted in French media as saying that the characteristics of the illness and the symptoms that have been described by the athletes make one think that it is covid-. Caumes added: You saw that in France, we had our first official case end January. Then a few days ago, we realised that the first French case actually appeared at the end of December at the Bondy hospital. And we will no doubt find other cases from December. So Iaposm not very surprised that exactly the same thing happened in Wuhan.

People have been ordered to stay in their homes unless they are shopping for groceries, exercising, helping a vulnerable person or going to work . All non-essential businesses have been ordered to close, with pubs, restaurants, bars, cinemas and clubs all shutting up shop for the foreseeable future. Thousands of staff members have been put on furlough, with the government paying % of their wages in an effort to protect jobs.When will pubs reopen  Pubs look set to be in the last wave of businesses to reopen as the lockdown eases in several phases. That means we do not have a set date for when they will open their doors. Pubs could reopen at the end of August or early September, according to a draft -page plan to take the country out of lockdown.But Downing Street has made clear any dates could change. This is because each phase will only go aheadthe scientic advice suggests coronavirus is not spiking up again in the UK. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “What we’ll have to do as we make changes is monitor the impact those changes are having upon the R rate in particular. “And once we have that information, we’ll obviously be able to judgeand when we’re in a position to go further.” When pubs do reopen, customers would be expected to follow strict social distancing rules to minimise the risk of COVID- spreading. But ministers at one point refused to rule out the possibility that pubs would be closed until Christmas. And speaking about society in general, Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned: Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine, then I suspect we’re going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.

In a study into how the UK governmentaposs measures affected the outbreak, researchers from the University of East Anglia said the closure of schools and banning of mass gatherings did work in slowing down the spread. However, they found that the governmentaposs message to aposstay at homeapos was not associated with any additional impact on efforts to curb the virus. In their findings, they wrote: The current epidemic of COVID- is unparallelled in any recent history as are the social distancing interventions hat have led to a signicant halt on the economic and social le of so many countires. However, there is very little empirical evidence about which social distancing measures have he most impact. They continued: We found that closure of educational facilities, prohibiting mass gatherings and closure of some non-essential businesses were associated with reduced incidence whereas stay at home orders, closure of all non-businesses and requiring the wearing of face masks in public was not associated with any independent additional impact. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here The study also revealed that widespread closures of all non-essential businesses and stay at home orders seem not to have muchany value. The research follows claims from Dr Johan Giesecke, of Stockholmaposs Karolinska Institute- who said lockdowns are unnecessary because the virus is unstoppable. Although he admits the benefit of preventing hospitals from becoming overwhelmed which, the UK Government says, has been its aim all along. Writing in an article in  - fulltext rssyes#%\" rel\"nofollow\"The Lancet, Dr Giesecke said: aposMany countrieshave marvelled at Swedenaposs relaxed strategy in the face of the coronavirus disease pandemic: schools and most workplaces have remained open, and police officers were not checking oneaposs errands in the street.  In a televised address on March , Mr Johnson said: “From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home.”  He then went on to list the reasons people could leave their homes:Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household Any medical need, to provide car or to help a vulnerable person Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from homeIn his address on March  the Prime Minister said the emergency measures will be in place for at least three weeks before they were later extended for another three weeks.

And Downing Street ordered the nation not to go sunbathing or go out to mark VE Day this weekend - stressing that the lockdown remains fully in place for now.

Most of us have to make a few compromises when hunting for a new place to live, whether it be size, location or cost. But a flat which has gone on the market is attracting attention by offering a very unique aposviewapos - leaving people questioning whether the design is even legal. It comes fully furnished and features a double bed and lounge area with a TV, costing just under £ a week. The flat in Sydney even offers two weeks rent free as an extra incentive, leaving you with a bit of spare cash to make it your own. So far, so good.One striking feature, which has escaped the attention of absolutely no one, is that the shower and toilet are located in the kitchen, leading to an open plan living area and bedroom. Although there has been an attempt at creating bathroom walls, the designer opted to go with glass to really open up the space. So not only will you be able to keep an eye on the cooking as you do your business, your guests will also be able to keep an eye on you, too.Itaposs listed with Exclusive Real Estate’s Emma Mattiuzzo, who told Realestate.au : There are a lot of properties on the market at the moment, so this all about creating a point of dference in a crowded field.

Exercising, excessively playing with your hair throughout the day and overuse of products can all make it go greasy quickly. So, anything we can do to cut down the number of times we have to go through the gruelling process is appreciated. Thankfully, a woman has an answer for us. TikTok user @annatocks revealed her hair washing routine in a video which she shared to her channel, and fans canapost wait to try it out for themselves. She explains that a DIY clarying rinse, made from apple cider vinegar, baking soda and warm water - along with a little help from dry shampoo - is what helps to keep her hair looking fresh for an entire week. According to Anna, the concoction of vinegar mixed with baking soda balances the scalp PH an claries the root area - meaning it removes any build up!.  Before washing her hair, Anna aggravates her scalp with a hairbrush until it hurts in a good, tingly way, which helps to get rid of any of that dead scalp skin, or dry-shampoo build up. She then adds a teaspoon of baking soda and a couple of splashes of apple cider vinegar to a cup of warm water, before washing her hair in this order - water, clarying rinse, water, shampoo twice and then condition. You may be thinking, why shampoo twice   The first time lts the dirt from the root and the second removes it from the rest of the hair.

Hopefully, when the time#s right and everybody is safe, we need to make sure we are ready to go.”Dundee have been heavily linked with afor striker Simon Murray, who is a free agent after leaving South African side Bidvest Wits last month, while a permanent move for St Johnstone midfielder Ross Callachan could also be on the cards.His loan spell at Dens was ended prematurely with a broken leg but impressed in his short time there and is out of contract in the summer.McPake has also never hidden his desire to see Hearts forward Craig Wighton back with the Dark Blues.The current concern for teams like Dundee in the lower isions, however, is how next campaign might look.The SPFL have begun a league reconstruction task force led by Hearts chair Ann Budge and Hamilton chief Les Gray to revamp the setup for the new campaign.Dens Park managing director John Nelms is part of the -strong reconstruction group but McPake admits he’ll be happy with whatever future is decided, as long as it benefits the game as a whole.He added: “My preferred option is that we just find a way to get something that works.“Look, we need to make sure everything is safe first.“Do I have a preferred option  I would love to be in the Premiership but we had a chance to do that ourselves this season and we failed.“If we had won the league, it would have been a given.“Butreconstruction happens, whatever way, I just hope they do it so that it suits the game going forward.“Would our input as managers help  But do we then ask players as well “It is a tough one. Do I want to be involved  No, I am happy to leave it to the powers-that-be and just concentrate on my job getting our squad ready so that when we do get the green light to go ahead we can do that.“I just want football back, I think society wants football back andreconstruction comes in then great.“But there are people out there risking their lives to save lives so they are the real important ones.” months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium

united","story":"Mal Brannigan’s exit from Tannadice on Friday night was a surprise – for the first time in Mark Ogren’s reign there are some uncomfortable questions to answer.It did appear like a bolt out of the blue, Brannigan had been interviewed in this very paper just the day before he left his role as managing director.A sudden departure for a club’s managing director raises questions over what is going on behind the scenes.There are obvious issues there, evenwe don’t really know what’s brought about the decision to part company.The manner of the club in dealing with the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation raised some suspicion a couple of weeks back.It came across as an extreme reaction to a fan group looking to hand over a serious sum of money they had raised.To blacklist them so publicly was a very strange move.That was the first time there had been anything other than positive news coming out of the club since the Ogrens took over.Brannigan’s departure coming so soon afterwards makes it dficult to think anything other than they are linked in some way.Like the rest of the fans, I am on the outside looking in.But it doesn’t seem like everything is as rosy behind the scenes as we’d been led to believe.That doesn’t mean there’s a scandal waiting to be uncovered but a bit of clarity from the club in what’s been going on would be good.Fallings out and disagreements behind the scenes tend to happen when things aren’t going so well on the pitch.That’s what has jarred so much about this past couple of weeks at United.The club are in such a good place, they’ve won the Championship and are gearing up for the Premiership next season.Money has been invested in the first team, the academy and certainly around the stadium.The Ogrens’ reign has been pretty much positive right the way through.The sort of questions this last fortnight has brought about will be unwanted ones from their point of view.It’s certainly not the kind of attention the Americans or those involved with running the club want or need right now.I just hope it’s not an indication there are problems at Tannadice.Until we hear more from the club, all United fans will be concerned about that scenario.Just like everyone , I was keen to hear John Nelms’ viewpoint on the SPFL voting farce last month.I thought he came out of the interview in the Tele very well.I agree with him that Dundee were stuck between a rock and a hard place – being third they would be unlikely to go up in any league reconstruction.Any benefit would be a longer-term thing where they’ll likely be in a good position for promotion to the Premiership in the new set-up.You could feel the frustration in Nelms from his quotes about the position he and Dundee had been left in by the SPFL.I actually felt quite bad for him over the way it had all been handled by the powers-that-be.You could tell he was holding back on what he thought of Inverness and the leaked WhatsApp messages, too!Nelms came across well and made a good point about Rangers – the vote didn’t even concern the Gers directly so why did the fans all go crazy at Dundee The football world never ceases to amaze.Tommy Wright did a great job at St Johnstone – consistently challenging despite not having the budget to really compete with the big boys.I have to say I found the timing of his departure from McDiarmid Park strange.Maybe he’d just had enough of battling away for so long.Technically this season isn’t even over yet. Maybe the shutdown just gave him enough time to think about his future.And the Northern Ireland manager’s gig is available…This week we’ll see what evidence Rangers have on the SPFL over the voting saga. I have to say I’m keen to see what they have – after all this time,it’s nothing major, they’ll be left with egg on faces. months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin.

Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

He said: ldquoI honestly donrsquot think I have ever read a fantasy novel!ldquoThat same literary agent, when she was trying to get a publisher for Snowball Oranges, told me detective novels were always popular.ldquoIrsquove never read one of those either and she said, lsquowell,you write one it will be original, evenit is rubbishrsquo.ldquoThat was the same attitude I took towards writing the fantasy novel.ldquoThe reaction so far has been quite encouraging.Peter was in popular s jazz band the Clyde Valley Stompers, who charted with Peter and The Wolf and were supported by The Beatles before the Fab Four made it big.Later, Peter produced more than  albums ndash including the Royal Scots Dragoon Guardsrsquo international chart-topper Amazing Grace ndash the biggest-selling instrumental of all time with  million sales.Thank you for reading this story.

We know local newsagents deliver to many people, but this short-term scheme will ensure that people who donrsquot get a delivery or who canrsquot afford a Courier are kept in touch. It is also important to support the Courier during this periodwe are to see it survive. Newspapers are essential for local democracy and the Courier regularly reports on issues we discuss at the council.One of the volunteers who deliver the newspaper is Susan Taylor ndash in her beloved Dolly CV which goes by the name of Myrtille.Susan, whose day job is working for the Church of Scotland as an executive assistant, is one of the team of resilience group volunteers picking up prescriptions for residents.ldquoI volunteered because I really feel for those people in our community who are at risk and isolated due to the Covid- outbreak, she said. ldquoI have met some lovely people so far and am glad I am in a position to help.The project is paid for through the townrsquos Community Emergency Resilience Fund ndash which comprises public donations, funding from North Berwick Community Council and the North Berwick Trust.Rotary Haddington was always looking for ways to support its community, said club president Malcolm Collins.ldquoOur idea to bulk-buy and distribute copies of the Courier to the elderly and vulnerable originated from one of our members who was quick to realise that a signicant number of such people would soon begin to feel isolated and lose touch with what was happening locallythey were unable to get out and buy a copy, he added.ldquoAs well as providing local news, the initiative shown by the Courier by including pages of extra puzzles in the paper was also thought to be useful to help keep folk entertained during these dficult times.ldquoWe have now taken this idea forward and arranged to bulk-buy copies of the Courier each week in advance, have them delivered to a central hub and then arranged for them to be distributed to other locations where they can be made available to those in need e.g. Our Community Kitchen, those in care homes and other locations as they become known to us.Rotary Haddington members would ensure that the papers were delivered where they were needed, he added.Courier Editor Robbie Scott said: ldquoWersquore so grateful to these groups for supporting our communities during lockdown and the amazing work they do inspires us to produce the best papers that we can.ldquoFor them to also directly support us at a dficult time for all businesses is incredible and we thank them immensely.Anyone wishing to buy copies of the Courier for delivery to communities should email rscott@eastlothiancourier.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

No Great Power had risen so rapidly, none has fallen so fast and so far since national consciousness awoke in Europe.Germany had fallen not simply because the ldquoNazi fruit was rotten at its core but also because the Allies had been ldquosteadfast in their belief and purpose to restore the liberty that the very creed of Nazi doctrine impelled the Third Reich to destroy.In such measured tones did the leading article reflect the mood of the nation.The previous evening huge numbers of people had poured on to the streets of towns, villages and cities to begin their celebrations, prompted by a pm BBC announcement that hostilities were at an end.Civilians and servicemen and women surged through the main streets of cites, cheering, singing, dancing, waving flags. In many places, Hitler was burnt in effigy.On the Tuesday, Prime Minister Winston Churchill addressed the nation at pm by radio, to say the war with Germanywas finally at an end, but the fighting was not yet over.ldquoWe may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, said Mr Churchill, ldquobut let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead.ldquoJapan with all her treachery and greed remains unsubdued. The injury she has inflicted on Great Britain, the United States, and other countries, and her destestable cruelties call for justice and retribution. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task both at home and abroad.At pm King George VI took to the airwaves. ldquoGermany, who drove all Europe into war, he said, ldquohas been finally overcome, but ldquoin the Far East we have yet to deal with the Japanese, a determined and cruel foe. To this we shall turn with the utmost resolve and with all our resources.ldquoBut at this hour, he continued, ldquowhen the dreadful shadow of war has passed far from our hearths and homes in these islands, we may at least make one pause for thanksgiving and then turn our thoughts to the tasks all over the world which peace in Europe brings with it.All that day, celebrations continued without cease.In Glasgow, workers were not initially suretheir factories, shipyards and offices would be open or closed.

Scotlandrsquos impressive record in war production was also singled out for praise, from the iron and steel industry to the shipyards on the Clyde and on the east coast.The war against Japan would rage for another three months.

Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed. Most small states like Norway and Denmark seem to have managed the disease effectively. The outlier is Belgium which has had the worst headline death rate so far, partly because of its population density, and perhaps because the country which houses the European Commission has been the most open and ldquoborder-free.The true death rate league table, as the risk guru Sir David Spiegelhalter has pointed out, cannot be known until the pandemic is over. But there is pretty strong evidence that smaller countries do well. They seem able to move and adapt more quickly. They also tend to be more united and able to reach a rapid consensus.Of course, unionists have always insisted that, Covid aside, an independent Scotland would be too poor and dependent on UK subsidies to survive. It would certainly start le with a budget deficit. Butthe pandemic has shown anything it is that large deficits can be managed. Theyll have to be, because every country is now in the same boat.There was never any sound economic reason why Scotland should be any less able to manage its affairs than countries like Denmark or Norway. Nationalism is about security not economics.Anyway, in the bounce-back, assuming that it happens, Scotland will again find itself tied to policies that it doesnt choose, which may include another wave of Conservative austerity. The Westminster government will naturally look to London and the North of England, where its votes lie. They will be first in the queue for investment.This isnt out of malice, but simply because Scotland is another country. It seems blindingly obvious that we are entering an age in which voters and their governments are more nation-conscious than ever. Not in a spirit of xenophobic exceptionalism but out of practical necessity. They are nearer to the people and to their pain.Of course, independence is not coming tomorrow or the next day. There wont be a referendum in the near future, for obvious reasons. But after Covid, Scotland will continue to demand greater control over its own affairs. It will increasingly behave as an independent country, even though it is bound economically to the UK. If and when the next phase of Covid arrives, Scotland will not be following a policy dictated by Westminster.I think the voters are actually ahead of the politicians on this, and ahead perhaps of Nicola Sturgeon, who has been reluctant to appear to exploit this crisis for political ends. That is to be commended. There would always have to be cooperation between Scotland and England. But far from reviving the United Kingdom as a going concern, this pandemic could be the final nail in its coffin.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Closer to . and Covid transmission would be in a sustained decline closer to one and it would be on the cusp of accelerating out of control again as soon as lockdown is eased.: Scientists call for two-track approachthat would free majority from lockdown earlierThat is why the next few weeks are so crucial. Driving the R number down to . or lower would give the Government the ldquoheadroom to cope, as Ms Sturgeon put it, with the inevitable increases in infection rates that would follow the lting of any of the current control measures.Think of it as a precariously balanced see-saw where increased compliance with lockdown tilts the R number down, and a growing percentage of the population flouting the guidance tilts it up.The First Minister has sought to incentivise cooperation by outlining the possible freedoms and benefits which could be re-introduced before the end of Maythe evidence says it is safe to do so .Schools could be partially re-opened some NHS elective procedures and screening could resume people could be allowed to meet up with a small lsquobubblersquo of friends and family outwith their household more time outdoors for exercise and manufacturing, retail and construction businesses could be allowed operate again, as long as workplaces could be made safe and commuters did not overcrowd public transport.None of this is guaranteed, however. Rather, it is a carrot for a restless population bored of staying at home and lulled into a  sense of security by Boris Johnsonrsquos ldquopast the peak proclamations.: People who test positive for Covid could be offered accommodation away from household in new test, trace and isolate phaseAnd this is the crux of the problem the Scottish Government is facing. If the public take on board the FMrsquos pleas, stick with the rules, and even increase their compliance, then the R number will reduce, some small freedoms will be re-introduced, and the strategy will be seen as a success.But whatthey donrsquot  Already there are signs that lockdown is fraying: statistics point to more car traffic on the roads and more bus journeys being taken anecdotally people speak of their local neighbourhoods growing busier some cafes have opened for takeaways and motorists were seen queued up in their hundreds outside a Costa Coffee Drive-thru in Glasgow at the weekend. Warmer weather and sunshine wonrsquot help matters.If this continues, and the R number goes up not down, will the Scottish Government really countenance extending or even toughening up on its lockdown measures in the face of a clear pushback from the population that would render it ineffective anyway There is of course more to weigh up than just suppressing the virus. There are the detrimental impacts of lockdown on physical and mental health.While the focus has been on Covid, some cancer patients have seen their surgery or chemotherapy put on hold for their own safety and offered potentially less effective treatments such as radiotherapy or immunotherapy in the meantime. There are also thousands in pain as they wait for hip or knee replacements or struggling with ever-deteriorating vision while their cataract removal is delayed. That cannot continue.Workers in frontline mental health have described people presenting in crisis who had no prior history of psychiatric illness.

But exiting will be far from simple."},{"url":null,"title":"do-say-not-do-merchants-found","story":"This weekrsquos contestant is a young fella by the name of Neil Ferguson. Neil is a professor of mathematical biologywho works at Imperial College in London. Better known as ldquoProfessor Lockdown, he is one of the reasons you have not been able to hug your grandchildren for the past seven weeks .Now, now. Do not rush to judgment. Let us look at what he has done. Told governments that without a strict lockdown hundreds of thousands of lives would be lost  Yes. During said lockdown had not one but two assignations with his lover who lived across town, thus breaking the same rules that he had been promoting  Yes. Did so knowing that he had had the virus and had self-isolated for ldquoalmost two weeks  Yes. I think we have a clear winner here. Go on Neil, step on that rake!: Deaths in Scotland fall for first timeOne of many new words the crisis has given us is the term ldquocovidiot, used to shame people who are behaving in selfish, ignorant or arrogant ways and breaking the rules. It is usually applied to crowds of faceless ldquolittle people, when in truth some of the biggest covidiots of all are known to us and occupy positions of power and influence.Take the Prime Minister. Papers from the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesreleased this week show the Government was warned about the risk of shaking hands on March . The same day, Boris Johnson boasted of doing so with hospital patients, some of whom he thought had the virus. He went on to shake hands at a rugby match, then at a service in Westminster Abbey. Mr Johnson, as we know, went on to contract the virus and become very poorly indeed. People cannot help becoming ill. One thinks, in particular, about those who day after day are exposed to the virus often without proper protection. But for a PM to openly defy advice, and brag about doing so, was idiotic.The crisis reached a grisly milestone on Tuesday when it was confirmed that the UK had the highest reported death toll in Europe, worse than any other country in the world bar America. Not that such comparisons are encouraged. A new feature of the daily Downing Street briefings, and ministerial interviews, is the bit where we are told that comparing death tolls at this stage is unwise and unhelpful. Mr Johnson trotted out the same line yesterday when he made his long-awaited debut against Keir Starmer at PMQs.The ldquono comparisons argument goes like this. Dferent countries count deaths dferently and, while the next bit is largely unspoken, some of them cannot be relied on to tell the truth. Only after the crisis has passed, and after much data mining, can we say with any certainty how well, or otherwise, countries have performed. In the meantime, critics should put a sock in it and stop being wise after the event. Everyone is doing their best. Unprecedented times. Bad for morale, and so on.What nonsense. The idea that conclusions cannot be drawn at this point is ridiculous. More covidiocy. The process is already happening. On The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, was askedfewer people would have died had there been more testing earlier on. ldquoYes, he said. ldquoIf we had had , test-capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively, Irsquom sure many things could be dferent. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK Governmentrsquos chief scientic adviser, told MPs this week: ldquoIn the early phases,we had managed to ramp testing capacity quicker, it would have been beneficial.: Johnson gives signal on lockdown ltingAll over the country people are making their own minds up. They know the UK was too slow on testing too slow on lockdown not fast enough in tackling the crisis engulfing care homes and fell down on the job when it came to stockpiling the right protective equipment. Meanwhile, visitors from stricken countries poured in, untested.If the evidence points to such conclusions, why not admit the mistakes and learn from them  It would go against every fibre of governments to do so, but just as they are quick to claim credit for what has gone right, so they should acknowledge where things went wrong. Only in that way can the public be sure governments are learning from mistakes.With the lting of the lockdown approaching this matters more than ever. We are being told that nothing is certain. Scientic advice will be followed. Right decisions at the right time. Slow, steady and safe. Yoursquove heard the record before.How can we be sure this will be the case  The pressure to lt the lockdown, there from the start, is building. Though Scotlandrsquos First Minister continues to caution against any move being made soon, there has been a noticeable change of tone at UK Government level.The big push is on. Ministers who previously wanted to throw a supportive arm around anxious workers with furlough schemes are now fretting over the cost. There is a drip feed of stories in the media about what le after lockdown will look like.After being terried into staying at home we are being asked to believe that it will soon be safe to go back out there. The Prime Minister cannot wait to get going, despite his talk of caution. In the Commons yesterday he had to admit that he planned to unveil his plans to the public on Sunday via a televised address, rather than bringing them to the Commons first, because some changes could happen on Monday.Confidence or arrogance  Once again, the public is being asked to trust, without hesitation, the experts and the governments they advise. Two groups we now know contain people who do not follow their own guidance, and who, in the main, will not acknowledge they did anything wrong. Now that really is taking us for covidiots.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

As well as providing Scots with a massive puzzle to solve, the collection of images offers a rare insight into what le was like throughout Scotland in years not that long gone by, with pub interiors, fashion trends and interior design choices also captured.One of the most striking elements of the outdoor photographs is the lack of vehicles travelling on Scottish roads, while others capture everyday elements of le which were familiar at the time but are now long gone ndash such as one image showing firemen dressed in their yellow waterproofs, shoppers queuing outside their local fishmonger, and children playing in the street on their Chopper bikes.Lesley Ferguson, Head of Archives at HES, said: ldquoPeople will find this collection really engaging. Sometimes history can be too far away, whereas this is history that people will remember. Some show buildings and others are just street scenes taken at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road.ldquoUnfortunately, we donrsquot know where some of these historic photographs were taken and thatrsquos why we are asking for the publicrsquos help.While the images have been digitised and uploaded to Canmore, the online catalogue of HES archives, it was felt it would be too time-consuming for HES staff to st through the , unidentied images in an effort to find their location. Instead itrsquos hoped that visitors to the Canmore website will come to the rescue and email details of locations and buildings to HES staff.The images will be alternated regularly to allow more photographs to be catalogued. The unidentied images are among around , plastic photographic negatives and some printed photographs contained within the HES Scottish Development Department collection, most of which contain information regarding the location where they were taken.Some relate to the development of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while others show buildings in a state of disrepair and may be among the last photographs prior to the buildings being lost forever. Last year along, over , items from the HES archives were digitised, among them prints relating to signicant archaeological digs and images of excavations at historic sites such as Skara Brae in Orkney and Edinburgh Castle.They included approximately , prints digitised from personal research and work by prominent archaeologists such as Dr Euan Mackie, Roger Mercer and Vere Gordon Childe, with the oldest image dating from around .

Over one million archives documenting Scotlandrsquos archaeological sites, buildings, industry and maritime heritage are currently available on Canmore.Ms Ferguson added: ldquoBy digitising our archives, wersquore able to make them available to even more people.

Some people have accused the UK Government of acting, especially in the early days of the crisis, asthe British were somehow special, asBritish lungs would be resistant to foreign bugs, or we should do things dferently from Europe. They called it British exceptionalism.But there are signs of the same attitude in some of Scotlandrsquos response. To be fair to the Scottish Government, it has worked closely with the other administrations, but you can see a bit of exceptionalism in its approach to the tracing app being developed in London: Scotland might use the app, wersquore told, but onlyit works with Scottish systems. Therersquos a hint too we might want our own app. Our own spaceship.The problem with all of this is the same problem wersquove seen where in our response to the crisis: a tendency to talk about the virus in ways that do not increase our understanding of it. The virus doesnrsquot know when itrsquos crossed the border between Scotland and England, and lots of people cross the border every day, so we should have a response that works on both sides of it, and to talk in terms of Scottish and English apps is confusing. It doesnrsquot acknowledge how the virus actually works.The same applies to the issue of targets on testing: they too are a way of talking about the virus that doesnrsquot increase our understanding of it. The target that the UK Government has set itself is , tests a day, although the PM Boris Johnson was again suggesting this week that in time it might be , or more. This is the first problem with targets: why , or ,  Why not some other random number  What is the methodology The second problem is how targets affect behaviour and we can see it in the British Governmentrsquos approach and in many other areas of public le. When the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the daily target was being met, it was then revealed that the , figure included , tests that had been posted to people but might not actually have been carried out. But, you know, the target was met.This is exactly what targets do. Wersquove seen it before in hospitals with patients being made to wait in ambulances to meet AE targets and you may have seen it in your own workplace: management set a target and staff proceed to come up with ingenious and sometimes misleading ways of meeting it rather than working in a more honest way. The target becomes the focus rather than the problem it was supposed to fix. Worse: the target can conceal whatrsquos really going on.A better approach would be to drop the virus testing targets altogether and try to assess whatrsquos going on in a more sophisticated way. Are we getting the tests to the right people, for example staff in care homes  Are drive-through centres the best way of delivering the tests  Should the home testing kits be going to hospitals and care homes instead  Therersquos a danger that questions like that are not being asked because instead wersquore constantly asking: have we met the , target You can see the same need for a more nuanced approach when it comes to drawing comparisons with other countries. Wersquore now being told the UK has the worst coronavirus death rate in the world after the US, but dferent countries have dferent types of population, they can have more city dwellers than others, and, most importantly, countries do not all count the deaths in the same way. In other words, the comparisons can darken the picture rather than clear it.And it doesnrsquot end there because the next big test for how we think about the virus will be the end of lockdown. Some people tell me they wonrsquot leave home ldquountil itrsquos safe to do so, but ldquosafe isnrsquot a hugely helpful word here. A better word to use would be ldquorisk because wersquoll get out of lockdown when we work out, personally and collectively, what an acceptable level of risk is and then start living through it.

No community deserves this tag and for a day or so these streets piqued the curiosity of the media caravan before it moved on to feed on the misfortunes of some other benighted place.Our new friend is in trouble and perhaps sees in the councillor something solid and reliable. Soon, he is relating to us the events of the last  hours. These have not been vintage ones for our boy and have involved assault, robbery and a quest for medical relief that requires to be resolved in the next few hours. This isnrsquot a cry for help itrsquos a one-act tragedy.He needs to get to a council office and then a clinic before the close of business and so we chip in to get him a taxi. Hersquos mortied about taking our money though, and is only convinced to accept it when the councillor promises to come to his door ldquoafter Mass on Sunday night. He seems more relaxed now and says that we are a pair of ldquogood c**ts. As the taxi arrives he asks uswersquore behaving ourselves and, with a twinkle in his eye, entreats us to look after ourselves. He has started our encounter four goals down but he wonrsquot be defeated.This is Greenock Central, which was ranked top of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationearlier this year. This table measures income, health, employment, education, housing, crime and access to services. It took the title from Ferguslie Park in Paisley which was named third most deprived this time. The statistics are well-intentioned and designed to inform all the concerned agencies about spending decisions and service priorities across , small postcode areas called \"data zones\". Yet, every four years when the latest winners and losers are revealed the names at the top and bottom remain largely the same.Mere statistics, though, can never form a complete picture of a neighbourhoodrsquos worth and needs. We all form pictures of what a community rated Scotlandrsquos most deprived ought to look like and this part of Greenock doesnrsquot really fit. Councillor McEleny says: ldquoWersquove got a high population of pensioners here, and many of them have been living in poor health for maybe the last  years or so of their lives.He points to a homeless centre standing between the town and the water. ldquoThis place lies at the heart of the data zone and contributes to the statistics. You donrsquot see places like this in Stockbridge or Bearsden. Yoursquove got people in there whose needs are numbered in multiple strands of deprivation. They get into patterns of behaviour at a very early age when they leave school and find there are no jobs. That place is a monument to the failure of society. You canrsquot just keep throwing pound after pound at fire-fighting. You have to have early intervention and prevention. In many of these cases though, the time for early intervention has probably come and gone.Councillor McEleny is a well-kent figure on these streets and our walk is punctuated by local people stopping to chat and say hello. Soon, we reach the glass-roofed shopping centre that sits at the heart of the town and the councillor becomes animated in his disdain for it. ldquoThis whole area was a handsome and open place with green spaces. As a child I walked through here on my way to the other side of town or down to the waterfront.ldquoSadly, the stock solution favoured by planners in places struggling with de-industrialisation and de-population was to get more retail spaces under one big roof. Itrsquos a  economy. Many of the units were quickly occupied by chain-stores and coffee-shop franchises which replaced local shops, unable to compete with their prices. Thus, money was sucked away from the town and into the pockets of distant shareholders.ldquoThis is why Irsquom passionate about politics: this is where support comes from. We have a budget of poundm in Inverclyde but people want their good roads and their leisure facilities. When they see you spending money on things that only seem to benefit a minority they get disgruntled. This is the test of a decent society: how much are we willing to help those on the bottom rung Alan Coyle is the principal teacher in Pastoral Support at St Matthewrsquos Academy in Greenock and observes the challenges encountered by his pupils and their little victories each day of his working le. He says. ldquoItrsquos easy to be negative and hark back to the old days of busy shipyards and full employment. I think itrsquos remarkable that the area of the town which has emerged as the most deprived is pretty much its commercial centre. This is testament, I think, to the way this area has been decimated due to poor governance.ldquoBut local people are very protective of it and proud of its heritage, but they are also very aware of the challenges it faces. However, you canrsquot discuss Greenock without placing it in the context of Inverclyde as a whole. When I taught Modern Studies we used to talk about the paradox of Drumchapel and Bearsden separated by only a few hundred metres. Here, we have an equally striking dichotomy between Kilmacolm and the east end of Greenock. The gap between the most and least affluent in Inverclyde is the same as it is in any number of towns across central Scotland.ldquoOnce, we had the great industrial actions of the s and s and the Lee Jeans work-in. And we fans of Greenock Morton FC take enormous pride in the fact that when it came to the crunch, we fought to keep our club back in . The local community support came to the fore then. But I dont think that feeling is there anymore.A DISTANCE of  miles separates Greenock from the stately arrondissement of Stockbridge, north of Edinburgh city centre, but it may as well be a dferent planet. This opulent little village was rated the least deprived corner of Scotland in the SIMD table, although it seems bizarre to include a word like lsquodeprivedrsquo anywhere near this neighbourhood.Those who donrsquot know Edinburgh are inclined to describe it as a posh city, but itrsquos not really. Refined: maybe reserved: perhaps, but Edinburgh too has its edgy places. Stockbridge though, is a Brigadoon version of Edinburgh that you happen upon after a long walk down from Princes Street, not noticing it until yoursquore actually in it. Here, the pace of le seems to slow and yoursquore invited to leave your baggage at the side of the Water of Leith. Itrsquos an enchanting place that beckons you to linger a little and chill for a while. Running alongside it is an aptly-named district called Comely Bank.In public buildings and dwelling places are the obvious dferences between affluence and penury but you sense these too in the way that people carry themselves. In poor streets there is a sense of people needing to be somewhere soon ever-alert for some invisible threat. In places like Stockbridge they move with the languor thatrsquos the preserve of those who measure their plans in years not days.Today, I encounter Stockbridge in the middle of coronavirus lockdown but you canrsquot help wonderingmuch has changed with the social restrictions. The usual middle class caprices of cobbled streets and the neighbourhood watch are here. Not for the first time I wonder why such genteel vigilantism is only seen in those communities that least require it.Where there are betting shops in Greenock here there are little shrines to interior design selling bespoke kitchens and luxury lights. Next door to a bakerycalled Pattiserie Florentin there is a shop which sells something called a ldquoSublime Replenishing Night Masque, which in Greenock might equate to a facial. Across the road stands an ample shop-front calls itself a lsquoFloatariumrsquo which I initially took to mean a shop specialising in inflatable paddling pools. On closer inspection though, there was a dizzying and esoteric assortment of treatments some of which, like manicures and pedicures Irsquod heard of and others such as a Lash Bar and the eponymous Floatarium that toyed with my imagination. You could go your holidays here.Judging by the number of charity shops here Stockbridge seems to have a big heart too. These though wouldnrsquot be called charity shops anywhere  but luxury goods emporiums. The estate agents advertise properties in the poundk to poundk price range in Greenock Central there are decent two-bedroom flats available for poundk. Just over there is a gallery called lsquoDoubtfirersquo. Only in a place such as this would such a name not be considered comically ironic. In the Water of Leith underneath the old bridge stands one of Anthony Gormleyrsquos sculptures. In the streets around it I counted eight interiors shops and five art-shops. They donrsquot just have delicatessens here they have epicures, which are not to be confused with the products on offer at the Floatarium.A lady with a Jane Austen accent calls to me across the road. ldquoItrsquos all very weird, she shouts, smiling. ldquoBut the wine-shop is open and Irsquove managed to get a chocolate brownie. These are essential items in a Stockbridge residentrsquos shopping basket.Maggie Lennon, director of the Bridges Programme charity and now resident of Glasgow, recalls her years living in Stockbridge fondly. ldquoThere was always something thrilling yet comforting walking down those steep hills from the new town to Stockbridge, she says. Itrsquos where, she says, the regimented streets and thoroughfares of the New Town succumbed to the anarchy of the twisted and meandering lanes of the village. ldquoI always considered Stockbridge to be hip.ldquoAnd I loved the restaurants, bistros, wholefoods and wine bars. Maison Hector was famous for the wall of running water cascading down the wall in the gentsrsquo loo. This was a design feature. We even had a cricket ground to which the Lord Taverners turned up once a year for a charity match and a ball. If you got tickets for this you knew you had made something of yourself.BACK IN GREENOCK they choose not to be resentful at such apparent inequality in the space of an hourrsquos drive in an affluent country. Councillor McEleny points to the townrsquos own handsome places. Just a few hundred metres separate the benighted town centre from the redeveloped waterfront seafront and the splendid Beacon Arts Centre. A tennis club, a private school and a fancy hotel sit just a few streets away from the corner that houses five betting shops. ldquoFrom a planning perspective, says Councillor McEleny, ldquoyou have to ask how we allowed a system that allowed the town centre to be hollowed out and then filled with franchises and chains and the practice of permitting the bookies to take up all the empty shop spaces.Yet, he refuses to dwell on the glories of Greenockrsquos shipbuilding past and the well-paid jobs that made this place thrum with productivity and economic health. Instead he points to missed opportunities at a local level and a chronic lack of imagination and aversion to risk at a national level.ldquoWhen the shipyards began to close and the jobs began to disappear there was little thought given to what should happen next, he said. ldquoUnfortunately, Greenock encountered a perfect storm of circumstances all converging at the same time. Councils and governments were desperate for jobs and, in their panic, they invited the multinational supermarkets in with open arms.ldquoThe local producers all disappeared to be replaced by low-paid jobs contributing [less] to the long-term health of the local economy. Choices made nationally have also had an effect. Therersquos no thinking outside the box.ldquoCities have the tools to meet economic challenges. They will always attract finance and have a lucrative retail and night-time economy. The power of the public sector should have been better used in areas like this. Scotlandrsquos new Social Security hubs in Glasgow and Dundee are providing  jobs. Most of these are relatively high-paying, skilled jobs and would have made much more of a dference in Greenock than in Glasgow city centre. He salutes the Greenock , the much-loved local newspaper which has been chronicling and supporting the town for  years. ldquoLike many other local papers, they could have moved to the outskirts, but theyrsquore still here in the heart of the town centre. Itrsquos a very powerful symbol of solidarity and much appreciated around here.ldquoNeither Santander or Scottish Power are going to build large facilities here but our public sector has the ability to do this. Cities must accept thatwe want thriving towns which feed the cities then wersquove got to start doing things dferently or these communities and ones like Bute and the Western Isles are just going to keep depopulating.For those of us who live in and around cities itrsquos easy to forget that smaller and more far-flung places all need the same level of services: the bins still need to be picked up education and policing still has to be provided. But with fewer people yoursquove got less taxation to pay for it. The economic model is broken but it could be fixed with a little imagination.ldquoAny time a developer wants to build new houses therersquos supposed to be a mix to promote social cohesion. But the developers get round this by offering little parcels of land cheaply for social housing so that they donrsquot spoil their fancy developments with it.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils.

He’ll appreciate that we put the testing website together at a remarkable pace and so in the first iteration weren’t able to make this sort of important nuance for Orkney and island communities, but I’ll take that away and look at it.“He mentioned the answer to this in substance and the answer is to get the home testing kits working for Orkney [and Shetland] and I’m sure there’s a way through.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“I am glad that action will be taken to get this issue sorted. If key workers in the isles are not getting the testing that they need because they are getting inaccurate advice from official websites, that puts more people at risk and harms public confidence.“Island communities could benefit greatly from more access to home testing kits for key workers.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them. From close first hand experience I still maintain that the swishing sound of the blades is pleasant and certainly not as fierce and noisyas anyof the many gale force winds on Shetland.Or does that apply just to those who are incomers from other places like England for example Where do you hale from Ian  Just wondering !Llanfoist is just a walk from Crickhowell, I walk that distance most days!!! !! As you asked, for what it is worth, I have lived in Shetland  years now, longer than anywhere . Just the relevance of that is a bit beyond me but it seems you wish to know!!Ian, since I don’t live in Crug Hywel , a walk from where I do liveand back would be  miles. In my marathon running days that would have been a decent evening run but those days have gone. A short walk of  miles would be easier now.Ian, you did a Trump special and answered a query I did not make. I did not ask you how long you’ve lived on Shetland. My question was where do you hail from Haydn, I wrote rotor noise, not Chinook engine noise. Do not put words in my mouth.

Those people can then undergo further tests with the hope of slowing the spread of the disease.Soon after the outbreak, however, the national response moved from the #contain# phase to #delay# and most contact tracing was halted.This week has seen itas a key part of the national strategy.The government announced yesterdaythat a new contact tracing app was going to be piloted in the Isle of Wight as part of the first phase of the #test, track and trace# programme.When someone reports symptoms through the app, it will alert other users whom the person has been in recent contact with. Those users will then be sent advice, including how to get a test.The app is hoped to ramp up contact tracing and reduce the spread of the virus.Mr Dickson said it  was an important part of the strategy # and he felt the Isle of Wight pilot could have useful implications for Shetland, which shares some similarities, as an island community.Although the Isle of Wight is closer to the mainland and has a larger population, it has a single health board and Mr Dickson said it faced many of the same challenges as Shetland.In order to be effective, however, the app needs a signicant proportion of the population to sign-up, which could pose dficulties in isolated communities such as Shetland, where connectivity is poor in some areas.There have also been concerns raised about data privacy.But Mr Dickson said he was optimistic that folk in Shetland would support the programmeand when it was rolled out locally.#I#ve always found the people of Shetland to be hugely positive at responding to these sorts of challenges,# he said.#I#ve got no doubt that they will do the same here.#Until the app is rolled out more widely, however, Shetland#s contact tracing programme will be along the traditional  methodology.#Right now the digital  is not available for us,# said Mr Dickson. # So it#s back to the grind stone and the hard work of checking where people have been.#Nationally, , staff have been recruited to help with the manual checking of people#s movements, as an alternative tracing programme for those who do not have access to a smartphone or good connectivity.Mr Dickson said that in Shetland, health workers who have been unable to perform their usual work, due to the Covid- crisis, such as dentists, would be ready to help with the programme.But although Mr Dickson said it was possible to carry out this method of contact tracing effectively in Shetland, he said it would be a #Herculean# task to do it on a national level requiring an estimated , staff.With the digital , he said much of that need for labour could be reduced.But while the contact tracing is a useful step forward, Mr Dickson said it must be considered as part of a wider picture.#I think it#s a really useful string to the bow of the wider orchestra that we need to overcome this,# he said.He highlighted the NHS#s work helping care homes and delivering PPE as other ongoing parts of its work fighting the virus. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael calls on pm to be guided by science over coronavirus ","story":"Criticism has been levelled against Boris Johnson’s lockdown exit strategy, with Shetland’s MP claiming the Prime Minister is coming under too much pressure from Conservative backbenchers.Alistair Carmichael says he fears the PM is failing to rely on scientic evidence which has so far guided measures taken to combat coronavirus.It comes after Mr Johnson signalled measures would be eased on Monday next week.Identying ways for businesses to get staff members back to work are among the possible areas for change.Meanwhile, the Scottish government has welcomed a fall in the rate of deaths linked to coronavirus north of the border.But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned progress against the virus was “too fragile” to “immediately ease restrictions in any meaningful way”.For his part, Mr Carmichael believes there may be “some opportunities” for relaxing restriction measures # but onlythe science backs that up.s: “Some of what I hear does worry me, because it looks to me assome of what they are talking about involves easing lockdown because they are getting pressure from their own backbenchers to do that.Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. “The question of how we manage lockdown has to be done on the basis of scientic evidence.”He added: “My worry is that the longer it goes on the more influence the economy and political considerations will make over scientic and medical ones.”Mr Carmichael added his priorities would be to get school children back in their classrooms and “as many local businesses as we can ing again for the benefit of the people who need local services”.“I think it’s probably unrealistic to expect that we’re going to have tourists coming back here for most of this season,at all, and I just think these are the areas where we feel lockdown the hardest.”He added: “I don’t think you’re going to get back to full schools from zero. I think we’re going to have to look at a phased , and then we have to decide where priorities would be for that phased .”He suggested one priority may be topupils moving from primary to secondary first, as well as young people moving on from secondary school to higher education.“I don’t think we are going to be able to do anything signicant until we have got a proper track and trace regime in place. Anything  just risks a spike in cases again.”But Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston insisted the UK government was making decisions “rooted” in a “science-led approach”.“It is entirely understandable that many people are becoming increasingly frustrated being asked to observe lockdown,” he said.Jamie Halcro Johnston“But it has saved lives and no one in Shetland needs reminding of the impact Covid- has had in the islands.“It is therefore crucial that the steps we take as we come out of lockdown are based on robust science, have the confidence of the public and are clear and easy to understand.“That’s why it is reassuring that the UK government has taken, and continues to take, the best scientic evidence available, and their proposals for test, track and trace is rooted in this science-led approach.”He challenged the Scottish government to improve testing capacity and ensure Scotland “doesn’t miss out from being part of the NHS mobile app which could be so important in identying those with exposure to Covid- and reducing the spread of the virus”.“Equally important is that, as restrictions are lted, everyone understands what is required of them in their daily lives. This really is a case of a common approach and a common message saving lives.“Those who promote a dferentiated approach ignore the practical implications of that.#We must avoid mixing messages and any ergence in practice across the UK must be based on clear need, and not on doing things dferently for the sake of it.” raquoHow about getting our councillors back to work so that they can start getting to grips with developing an economic recovery plan to try and mitigate the effects of the impact of a government mandated shutdown.The four pillars of our economy are crumbling..

We also reached out to our friends in Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William Flute Band and were delighted to be able to work with them to distribute over  care packages to some of the most vulnerable members of our community.Obviously thanks must go to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council for providing the grant and for the extremely fast turnaround throughout the application process, the club would also like to thank Maurice Cooper and the Ballee Discount Shop for helping us source the products. Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

With public gatherings still the subject of prohibitive legislation, the impact has been felt by many local suppliers of wedding music. Kirsty McKenna says the wave of postponements began when the British Prime Minister made his televised announcement on March . “When Boris Johnson had announced there were going to be restrictions put in place, everybody started to panic,” she told the County Derry Post. “Towards the end of March, I started to get messages from people saying they were going to have to postpone their wedding to a dferent date. googletag.cmd.push “I didn’t start getting actual rescheduled dates for a few weeks after that because there’s a lot going on. “Hotels are in a sticky situation too as they don’t know themselves when they’re going to be able to hold weddings again. Some people have postponed until a year after their original date. “It’s quite hard to get a wedding booked in, you nearly need it booked in a year and a half, or two years before your date, because of the high level of bookings people have.” As couples perform the logistical gymnastics required to reschedule their wedding, some will inevitably find that their preferred musician is unavailable for their refixed date. googletag.cmd.push This can result in some awkward conversationsa deposit has already been paid to a supplier, and Kirsty says finding a solution can be tough. “It’s a hard one, because for a lot of people, this is their only form of income,” said the Ballinascreen woman. “None of us saw this coming, so I can sympathise both with the couples that don’t get their deposit back and the suppliers that are unable to give them back. “I’ve tried my best where possible,we’ve had a cancellation, to give the deposit back because I know that this is just such a tough time for everybody. “I’m hoping in the long run that maybe I can get somebody  who has had to postpone that maybe hasn’t had a supplier available for their date. “Many depend on the bookings coming in. The furthest booking I have at the minute is in , so that’s two years away. “When you get that deposit through,that’s your livelihood, you’re not going to hold onto it for two years. I can understand the position some people are in.” Kirsty has been trying to give something back to key workers and NHS staff by offering them a discounted rate on their wedding music when things eventually settle down. While on lockdown-imposed hiatus, she has also been using the opportunity to upload more music to her Facebook page and develop her art. She said: “I don’t have that many covers or videos up on my page and I’m trying to get back into the swing of things and get more up. “Over the last two months, I haven’t really had any videos up, but I put up a cover of ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ the other day as a wee thank you. “The whole thing at the minute has been the rainbow pictures that kids have been painting – it’s been a symbol really for the tough times we’re going through. “There are a lot of negative things, soI can break that up with a song here and there, it might help matters.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is anticipated that with funding leveraged from partners and the private sector the final figure may sit closer to poundm. The local council has reiterated its plans to relocate to Foyle Street in order to make way for Ulster University expansion in the form of the Magee Medical School - one of the cornerstones of the City Deal. An Ulster University document shows an artists impression of an expanded Magee campusalong the riverfront. Earlier this week, Sinn Feacutein Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said she was ‘delighted’ that the Executive agreed to match fund Derry and Strabane’s City Deal Inclusive Future Fund. googletag.cmd.push The pound million is ‘transformative for Derry and the NW’, she said, and ‘goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community and business leaders.’ As far back as November , former SDLP MP for Foyle Mark Durkan raised the prospect of a City Deal for Derry. Speaking at Westminster at the time he said: “In my own constituency, people would love to see city deal status even within our devolved settlement for the city of Derry. “We need to look at this in a more fluid way and to get away from the politics and find the democracy.” googletag.cmd.push As it transpired, Belfast would be awarded Northern Ireland’s first City Deal as part of his Autumn budget in October . It is a year since the Derry region’s own deal was announced on May , . The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. It has now been matched by the NI government bringing the overall total to poundm. Last week Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process expected to take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. Derry City  Strabane District Council has submitted all project proposals to government at this stage and the council continues to work with government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. Council relocation Welcoming the match funding announcement a council spokesperson said it was ‘hugely positive’ news for everyone involved in the project. She also confirmed that the council still plans on relocating from its headquarters on the Strand Road to Foyle Street car park adjacent to the Guildhall. However, the council previously made it clear that these proposals are dependent on a number of factors, including funding and are all at an early stage of development. Speaking yesterday a spokesperson said: “Work will progress over the coming weeks and months to advance and develop the regeneration projects earmarked for the match-funded Inclusive Future Fund that include the development of the Riverfront at Queen’s Quayand signature tourism projects , all of which are in the process of being scoped out and business cases prepared. “The proposed relocation of the Council offices still remains a key priority of the future planned expansion of the Ulster University and the development of the riverfront moving forward. “The Council will continue to work with Government and key partners to bring forward the City Deal to the next stage including the Heads of Terms and remains committed to developing the key catalyst regeneration projects that will bring about growth and prosperity for Derry and Strabane and the wider North West region.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ulster University is one of the main beneficiaries with pound earmarked for innovative research centres in personalised medicine and data analytics which are becoming ever more important in an increasingly technological world. These industries will shape future economies and healthcare. Healthcare research and treatments have been at the forefront of the COVID- pandemic. For example, personalised medicine is based on identying subgroups of patients with distinct mechanisms of disease or particular responses to treatments. Data analytics is another key component in the response of governments to the current crisis. googletag.cmd.push It involves analysing emerging data from countries around the world to identy the most important factors that can help slow the spread of the virus and help find long-term solutions to the pandemic. In the longer-term, data analytics will be well-placed to support Northern Ireland industry in the recovery process, post COVID-, by helping recovering NI businesses to improve their products and processes, develop new skills, unlock global opportunities and encourage collaboration across sectors. It’s understood that well-paid jobs created in these sectors would not be restricted to graduates but would benefit everyone in the city across the skills spectrum. Other headline investments are poundm for Derry’s riverfront and Queens Quay and Strabane town centre regeneration to the tune of poundm. googletag.cmd.push The figures below were outlined by Derry City  Strabane District Council at meetings last year. It is a rough guide but it’s understood that money allocated to dferent projects has altered which will be explained.  Ulster University- poundm UU has been allocated poundm, a considerable portion of the financial package. The university will contribute % towards the Magee projects. Of the overall amount, poundm will come from the UK Government’s City Deal funding and pound from the Inclusive Future fund to finance four dferent projects. Derry City  Strabane District councillors have repeatedly called on the university to show its commitment to the city by approving the graduate entry medical school and relocating its health science courses to Magee with a view to delivering on the promised , full-time students .  The core focus of the poundm City Deal funding remains the delivery of the centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation . Yesterday, UU confirmed that upon confirmation and approval of the business cases there will be further information with regard to student numbers, research posts and staff numbers. The Cognitive Analytics Research Lab or CARL is said to be a transformational new cutting-edge applied research centre based at Ulster University’s Magee campus. It will support Northern Ireland businesses to understand how data analytics and AI can benefit their business. CARL will work with sectors as erse as health, financial technology, media, energy and public policy. The centre will be a physical building where companies can work in close collaboration with UU researchers. CARL researchers will also work with entrepreneurs to develop new start-up companies. UU’s strong commercial focus has already led to the creation of numerous successful spin-out companies including ActionSENSE and AirBRIO and the award-winning wearable neurotechnology company NeuroCONCISE. It has been said that the CARL innovation centre would provide the city with global opportunities to become world class in areas such as software engineering, advanced networks and sensors, data analytics and cyber security and would offer huge potential to the city and wider region’s economic development. Another UU project, the Centre for Industrial Digitalisation, Robotics and Automation  is an innovation centre which will support industry and commerce in Northern Ireland. It will help companies across all sectors with their digital technology agenda helping to improve innovation, productivity and competitiveness and adapt to Industry .. This state-of-the-art facility will be a dedicated space for demonstration, experimentation, and an industry hub. It will assist in skills development for local and international industry. Focussing on innovation and developing competitiveness when it is more pertinent than ever, the Centre will partner with local businesses to build capacity in their workforce. CIDRA will also play a key role in helping to attract new industry partners to locate in the city and region. During the COVID- crisis, members of Ulster University’s School of Computing, Engineering  Intelligent Systems who will be involved in CIDRA have been making face shields using D printing and laser cutting - , face shields have been safely delivered to primary care COVID- centres at Altnagelvin and local health centres. Currently, Ulster University’s School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent Systems is collaborating with a local company Derry company to develop an automated face shield manufacturing line. CIDRA and CARL will be located in close proximity enabling potential for collaboration.  The Future Fund of poundm with joint funding from the NI government will be focused on advancing projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus and a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence . It is hoped government approval for that project will be announced in the coming days. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, council-wide, multi-skills employment intervention support programme. It would expand upon the work of Altnagelvin based C-TRIC - a not-for-profit personalised medicine institute based on the Altnagelvin Area Hospital site which connects patients directly to research opportunities in the North West area and beyond. THRIVE proposes to have research centres for pediatric cancer and neuromuscular cancer amongst others. It will train the next generation of doctors and skilled staff in personalised medicine, health data analytics, healthcare policy and economics. C-TRIC and THRIVE are viewed as the research arm of the proposed Medical School.  Queens Quay Derry riverfront projects - poundm Future Fund match funding of poundm had previously been allocated to this project. The council now says that this project will receive approximately poundm but it is unclear where the outstanding poundm will be redirected.  Key tourism, economic, and social projects and initiatives - poundm Last year the council said that signature tourism projects will be allocated poundm. It now says these projects will be allocated poundm but did not state to which project the other poundm will be awarded.  Digital SMART cities - poundm A report to council previously stated that poundm would be set aside for digital SMART city projects. All over the world, rapid urbanisation is putting enormous stress on resources and infrastructure which cannot be solved in a traditional way. The Smart Cities agenda recognises that cities and regions grapple with many of the same issues - traffic congestion, air quality, inadequate energy, poor management of the environment, climate change, and data privacy, etc. and that there are signicant opportunities to share learning. The transition to smart places requires government, citizens, the business community and wider civil society working in synergy so that the effective interplay between policy and innovation meets the needs of citizens. A council spokesperson previously said: “If we reflect on the past decade, the way we live, conduct business, and interact and engage with each other has changed dramatically. “Yet, we are only at the beginning of a digital change that will transform our societies. Local government has a key role to play in harnessing the smart city opportunity, making cities more liveable and creative, improving services, competitiveness and standards, embracing technology and innovation, maximising the potential of the mountains of data generated, and facilitating a convergence of digital infrastructure with physical development.”  Skills- poundm Derry City  Strabane District Council has earmarked poundm for skills but did not provide any further detail.  Strabane town centre regeneration - poundm Match funding of poundm from the NI Government will be used to fund this project.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chloe Tinneyhas now set her sights on the real thing with plans to climb an ‘actual mountain’ in future. She managed the epic feat in  days to raise funds for her ‘heroes’ at Foyle Search  Rescue. Mount Everest is earths highest mountain above sea level. With the help of a few calculations Chloe worked out that she had to climb , stairs, , flights of her stairs, at a rate of  flights a day for  days. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old devoted herself to the task by iding her time wisely between her full-time job and conquering the stairs. Her ascent got underway on April  and it has been gruelling climb ever since. She has been hampered by a niggling repetitive strain injury to her knee along the way which was attributed to the left turn in the stairs. This meant she had to use a crutch for the vast majority of the challenge and cut out the turn to avoid aggravating the injury further. An astounding pound, raised so far for Foyle Search  Rescue more than six times her original target. googletag.cmd.push Speaking after reaching the summit yesterday, she said: “My leg injury has been feeling slightly better so I have been able to do the last  days without use of my crutch which is making it so much easier. “I also think my body has adapted to having to walk up stairs for  -  hours a day, every day because I am finding it easier every day. “That being said, I cant say it is something I will keep up,” she joked. “I cant wait to be done and have a little rest, maybe eat a pizza and have a glass of wine to celebrate being done with stairs. “Maybe Ill climb an actual mountain when this is all over  “I am genuinely so taken back and actually quite emotional about the generosity of everyone towards me during this time. From donating money to the amazing FSR, sharing posts, offering encouraging words, and so much more. Thank you just isnt enough. “I know the donation to FSR will mean so much to so many people and will definitely be put to amazing use to help all the folks at FSR continue to be heroes in our city.” Donations will remain open for another three days,you would support her cause visit:https:www.crowdfunder chloe-climbs-mount-everest-from-her-home  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was recently announced that the Department for Communitiesfood box scheme was capped with an overall delivery capacity of , boxes per week across Northern Ireland and will be time bound. In terms of delivery to the Derry City  Strabane District Councilarea, full capacity has been reached and there can be no increase beyond the , of food boxes received. Currently, it is estimated that there is an existing demand of , Food Boxes which is  in excess of the current allocation and consequently a reserve list has been formed. googletag.cmd.push People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin commented: I and many others arealarmed to be notied that the Department for Communities has capped the weekly free food parcel scheme for those shielding and in financial hardship across the North. We are calling for this decision to be reversed immediately. In Derry and Strabane , people have been accepted to receive a food parcel but the number has been articially capped here at ,.  people havebeen placedona reserve list with no guarantee they will receive food help. Its also been announced no further referrals will be accepted even though many people are not aware the scheme exists. This is discrimination and a breakdown in the departments duty of care for those in need. googletag.cmd.push Since the Executives decision to implement Tory welfare reforms our already high levels of deprivation have rocketed across the North. The clearest example of this was the rising dependence by many iniduals, familiesand workers on food banks. The Covid- crisis isputting many more people into financial hardship. Now is not the time to cut off access to the food program - funding should be increased based on need not on an articial figure thatunderestimates food poverty. The Covid- crisis has already forced many more people to apply for meagre welfare benefits. And many more people will be forced to applytheir jobs dont . With more people unemployed and dependent on benefits food poverty will increase further across the North. The Stormont Executive has the responsibility to make sure this is addressed. Political establishment parties are already talking about the need for austerity and hard choices - working people and the vulnerable should not be forced to bear the financial burden of this crisis. On April  the Department for Communities Covid  said its FoodParcelService has been hugely successful in getting immediatefoodand essential supplies to those most in need, with , boxes having been delivered to the  Council distribution centres in the three weeks since the service started. This service is part of the emergency response for those who are in critical need offoodand have no other means of accessing it, either through deliveries, or help from family and friends. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The delivery offoodparcelsto those in need was developed as one of the key strands of the Departments emergency response to the current crisis situation. The service has been a major success with a large number of boxes being delivered to those in need via partnership working between Councils and our grass roots Community Organisations. When theschemeopened it was envisaged that approximately ,foodparcelswould be needed, but due to the current situation the Department has delivered thousands more.” “Our current suppliers have now informed us that it not possible at present to go beyond a supply capacity ceiling of ,foodboxes per week. This is due to the sourcing offood, the capacity of suppliers to pack, prepare and distribute at volume – and additional limitations such as the need for social distancing requirements. We will continue to deliver to the thousands already receiving theparcelsand the Minister will be holding urgent meetings with officials to explore all available options.  “This service is one element of our overallfoodsupport programme, aimed at those who are in most critical need. People can also use the helpline to be connected to other means of support, including volunteers who can collect shopping, or community groups andfoodbanks who can provide support. For those people who still require access to such help contact the COVID Community Helpline on    in the first instance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

In a decade that was dominated by Ballinderry and Slaughtneil, it will come as no surprise that players from both squads feature heavily in this selection. Five clubs in total are represented. . Michael Conlan  Mickey C, as he is affectionately known, was a player who maintained high levels of consistency for many years. As the years progressed, all aspects of his game got better, a result of endless hours of hard-work and an inner drive to be the best he could be. He was a pivotal figure in the Shamrocks famous three in a-row success. googletag.cmd.push . Paul McNeill  An exceptional corner-back who possesses all the qualities required to defend in the modern game. He is quick, tenacious, rarely fouls and very good on the ball. Extremely disciplined and a real team player. Still more to come from him and I expect to see him become a permanent fixture in defence for the county team. . Brendan Rogers  One of the best club full-backs I have witnessed. He is extremely athletic and his ability to carry the ball - yards out of defence on a consistent basis is a real plus for Slaughtneil. His performance against Ballinderry in last year’s quarter-final was one of the best I have seen from any club player to date. googletag.cmd.push . Karl McKaigue  Completing the full-back line is Slaughtneil’s Mr Consistency. Always handed the job of snuffing out the oppositions best forward, a task he completes on most occasions with relative ease. He is also very comfortable on the ball and has the ability to get vital scores on days when the forwards are perhaps not firing on all cylinders. . Kevin McGuckin  Was a key figure for Ballinderry in their championship successes in ,  and . As the years progressed, he moved from his natural corner-back position to featuring regularly in the half-back line and midfield. An excellent reader of the game, who is always assured when in possession. A natural leader who will leave a big hole when he decides to retire. . Chrissy McKaigue A central figure in their domination of Derry and Ulster club football from -. A highly driven inidual who strives for perfection. Like many of his team-mates, possesses excellent athletic ability and he uses this to constantly put opposing teams on the back foot. . Barry McGoldrick  One of the leaders for Coleraine when they landed their first senior title in  and in their more recent success of , he was still the main driving force. A strong presence, an excellent reader of the game and very clever in how he uses the ball. Very good at organising those around him. . Fergal Doherty  Even though he last played championship in , his performances for Bellaghy in the earlier part of the decade were of the highest level. Hard as nails, an absolute warrior in every sense of the word. His ability to compete for kick-outs meant that most opposition teams lost the midfield battle. Phenomenal stamina and a superb kick-passer, he really was the complete midfielder. . Patsy Bradley  Could have copied and pasted what I have written for Fergal, such are the similarities between both players. A very quiet player on the pitch who let his playing do the talking. Strong in possession and always extremely disciplined. A leader on and off the pitch. When he decides to retire, Slaughtneil will find it almost impossible to replace him. . Niall Holly  Whilst he played most of his football from midfield, he did have spells in the half-forward line. An excellent fielder of the ball whose direct running causes endless problems for opposing defences. Very strong in possession and as the years have progressed, has become a much better decision-maker. Even when subjected to constant abuse, he shows exemplary discipline. . Sean Leo McGoldrick  Another superb footballer who managed to maintain very high standards for many years. A play-maker whose vision made him stand out anytime you watched Coleraine play. Extremely versatile, intelligent and could play any position from –. Not afraid of hard-work and a real team player. A joy to watch. . Enda Muldoon  Could have selected Enda in any position from - and whilst he was an exceptional midfielder, he did play a lot of club football in the half-forward line. An excellent fielder of the ball, superb kick-passer and accurate free taker. Enda had it all and when it was required, he could demonstrate his physical capabilities. A once in a letime footballer. . Shane McGuigan  Has the ability to win his own ball and always makes himself available. Willing to make unselfish runs for others and when not in possession has an appetite for hard-work. Extremely accurate from play and frees. Displays a level maturity well beyond his young years. There is still much more to come from him in the next decade. . Benny Heron  Always produces the goods for Screen. Was the main man in their journey to county finals in  and . He makes intelligent runs and in big championship games he quite often has the company of two defenders, but yet still manages to exert an influence on proceedings. Very accurate from play and frees and has the composure to take goal chances when they appear. . Conleith Gilligan  Up until the end of , Deets continued to torture opposing defences. Not only is he quick off the mark but his runs are also intelligent and this makes him more dficult to track. Very comfortable on the ball and possesses extreme accuracy in front of goal. As well as my team selection, the following deserve special mention and were strong contenders: Antoacutein McMullan– a great shot stopper who very rarely wastes a kick-out and just missed out behind Michael Conlan. Collie McVey– a superb man-marker who never received the recognition he deserved and is edged out by Paul McNeill. Connor Nevin– a superb player for Ballinderry and Barry McGoldrick was picked ahead of him. Darren Conway– a vital cog for Ballinderrywho always produced the goods in the championship. Niall Holly was chosen ahead of him. Colm McGoldrick– a man who consistently performs at a high level and was central to Coleraine’s success. Just lost out to Benny Heron.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

In a letter to parents last week, P teacher Emer Scullion and Principal Deirdre Graffin stressed that the ceremony had not been cancelled. “Remember – First Communion is postponed – not cancelled,” it read. “Cancelled means it would never happen again and the chance for it to happen has passed. However, you will celebrate your FirstCommunion. googletag.cmd.push  “So,anyone said they are sorry your First Communion has been cancelled, you cansay that it hasn’t – it’s just postponed until another time.” Fr Gates and Fr Branigan of Magherafelt Parish offered to remember all the children in Saturday’s am mass, just when their First Communion would have been beginning. Children all sent a photo that was placed around the altar and were able to watch with their families at home via the parish webcam while taking part in the mass. Mrs Graffin urged the children to stay positive. She said: “This is a lovely reminder that we have not forgotten about special times in our lives and that like so many other things, this is just postponed. googletag.cmd.push “Although we don’t know exactly what the future holds, it will become clear.

EJB Car Sales Ltd took the decision to raffle the car after one their social media manager, Christine Orr fell ill with Covid- and experienced the care and attention of the healthcare staff. Owner Eamon Bradley said the idea originally came up while Christine was still in hospital. “She was admitted to the Altnagelvin Covid ward and was totally beside herself,” said the Garvagh man. “Whenever she was there, she got us the names of  nurses here and Jim’s we works in Coleraine, so she got us  names from the Coleraine ward. googletag.cmd.push “We were originally going to raffle a weekend away, but then we thought, ‘why don’t we go one better ’ and we decided to put the car up for raffle.” With all  staff safely into the draw, the raffle took place on Sunday evening with Dungiven native Maureen McGinnis taking home the Chevrolet . Spark.  The gesture comes after the company offered the use of a courtesy car for NHS staff last month in an effort to make their lives ‘a bit easier’. Eamon told the County Derry Post that he wanted to do all he could to help. “Those men and women are going onto what is classed as the front line, to save maybe a relation of mine or anybody,” he said. googletag.cmd.push Eamon’s brother Jim, whose we Nicola works in the Intensive Care Unit at Causeway Hospital, also weighed in by running a one-man marathon to raise over pound, to purchase equipment for the NHS.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Four of the main supermarket chains in N. Ireland have agreed with the Department for Communities to prioritise delivery slots for people who cannot get out to access food after receiving shielding letters from their GP asking them to isolate at home. The supermarkets involved are Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Iceland. Those eligible should sign up online at www.nidirect.gov.uk services register-priority-online-food-delivery googletag.cmd.push The Department will check eligibility and share details with the supermarkets who will contact customers directly to advise when delivery slots are available. Mayor Boyle said the scheme would help alleviate pressures on Councils and Community groups delivering emergency food aid on the ground, and urged anyone eligible to sign up. “I am delighted to see the major supermarkets supporting the Department and local Communities in their efforts to supply emergency food aid to those who are most at risk from Covid-. There are people who are unable leave their homes at all and who may not have family or friends to help with shopping. They are reliant on online services and this will greatly assist them to maintain shielding and protect themselves at this time of risk. googletag.cmd.push “The Department have been offering aid through their emergency Food Box scheme but this service is under increasing pressure, and these priority delivery slots will help alleviate some of that pressure. Some people who have signed up to the Food Box Scheme due to lack of availability of supermarket delivery slots may find their needs are now met through this scheme, freeing up food box availability for others. “I would really encourage anyone who is eligible – namely those who are shielding at home on the instruction of their GP, who don’t have other means of obtaining food – to submit their details.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be a phased resumption of training at both club and county level to allow players to prepare appropriately for playing games.

Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park

accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the

The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.ldquoWe will continue to review the appropriateness of this activity on a daily basis to ensure that it remains

local politicians, South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said he appreciates that for many, the ongoing roadworks across East Down ldquohas been a complicated

in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom.

The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all. We thank them for their generosity and I can assure them that the treats didnrsquot last too long.Mr Carabine said that the staff were coping with delivering items, mainly packages, and were as busy as they would be at Christmas mdash the busiest time of the year.ldquoI think the staff are coping admirably with the demand, as well as abiding by the two-metre social distancing rule in work.

He is disappointed at having to postpone his trip, but says itrsquos better to remain in New York.Tommy, who is a treasurer of a global finance company, usually commutes by subway into the heart of the Big Apple each day. However, since the city went into lockdown on March , Tommy has been self-isolating at home with his girlfriend, Lia.The former Crew Road resident has been living in New York since ,after he completed his Masters degree at Queenrsquos University Belfast, and says he only intended staying for six weeks.That same year he flew to Dublin on September  mdash the same day as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which he and friends had visited the previous day.ldquoWe had taken pictures with the security guards and other workers and it still haunts me wonderingthose guys were able to make it out alive, he says.Tommy says that  years on fear has ed to the streets of New York.ldquoAt the beginning of the pandemic back in early March our company was swt to respond. We put social distancing measures in place and rotated staff on a sht basis so that only a third of workers were in the office each day.ldquoWe knew the virus was going to get more severe so after we learned the St Patrickrsquos Day parade was to be cancelled we took that as a signal and mandated that all staff should stay at home.Tommy says the sweeping changes have left an eerie feeling in their wake.ldquoIn the first few weeks the only workers that remained in the city centre were builders availing of free movement and the empty streets to get ahead with development projects, but they too were forced to quit, he said.ldquoTraffic has all but ceased, apart from a few ambulances and delivery trucks.ldquoThe economic impact of coronavirus has been devastating, particularly for the Irish who have found themselves furloughed off, out of work and not entitled to any government aid.ldquoA charity has been set up called Slainte  which was formed with the sole intention of alleviating the suffering that many have been going through and to help those less fortunate to get through it.Tommy is also a leading figure in the GAA in New York which is supporting Slainte .At the weekend local Gaelic footballers in the city ran a combined distance of , kilometres, which is the equivalent of running theof Ireland, from Malin Head in Donegal to Mizzen Head in Cork mdash and back.The event was in place of a cancelled Gaelic football tournament and all proceeds went to Slainte .ldquoOver half of the people who have applied for help from Slainte  are in the hospitality industry which looks to be one of the last groups that willto work in all likelihood.ldquoThere is also a lot of great work being done by other Irish community groups in New York.Tommy says it is very encouraging to see the Irish community pull together during a time like this.He said: ldquoThe Irish are renowned for putting their shoulder to the wheel in times of adversity and the last few weeks have been no dferent.ldquoWersquore looking after each other as we always have done when hardship strikes.Tommy says people can still make donations to Slainte  by going to the link www.slainte.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11154527.jpg","title":"mart holds online cattle sale buyers homes","story":"It is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

weekend","story":"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the rules had not changed on social distancing and leaving home as the nation gears up to hear from Boris Johnson on Sunday on the way forward for easing restrictions.Speaking at the No  daily press briefing, Mr Raab said any short-term changes in the restrictions announced by the Prime Minister would be limited in their nature and depend on the reproductive number ndash the R ndash of the virus.He said: ldquoAny changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored.ldquoIf we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people arenrsquot following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place.ldquoFor the moment it is really important, particularly as people look towards a warm bank holiday weekend, that we continue to follow the guidance in place at this time.It comes after a day of tensions between ministers and the the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales over the way forward in lting the lockdown.Downing Street has insisted the Prime Minister would be announcing only a ldquovery limited easing of the social distancing rules when he sets out his ldquoroad map for the way forward in his address to the nation.However, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a warning that she would not be ldquopressured by the Government at Westminster into easing restrictions ldquoprematurely in Scotland.The Welsh Government also warned there was a danger of sending out ldquomixed messages amid newspaper reports that pub and cafe gardens could be allowed to reopen and restrictions on sunbathing and playing outdoor sports relaxed.Mr Raab insisted the Government was working with devolved administrations, adding: ldquoWersquore locked into the

R value ndash which refers to the number of people who can expect to contract coronavirus from an infected person ndash has risen in the last week, driven by transmission in care homes.Mr Raab said the Government is ldquoconfident it has the plan to decrease the infection rates in hospitals and care homes, where the R value is higher than in the community.He said: ldquoTesting is part of that but also itrsquos the movement of people in and out of those settings which is fuelling that transmission, so theyrsquore both parts of that problem.ldquoTherersquos not a silver bullet here, itrsquos about putting all the dferent bits of the jigsaw together and having a strategic, holistic approach.Earlier, John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that about , people a day are still becoming infected with coronavirus ndash a figure that UK national statistician Professor Sir Ian Diamond agreed with.Sir Ian told the Downing Street press conference: ldquoProfessor Edmunds is right that R has probably gone up a little bit from his last estimate and that is driven by the epidemic in care homes, and I would not ert from that.ldquoThat gives us a real challenge to reduce the epidemic in care homes and itrsquos one that I think, over the next few weeks, from what Irsquove seen, will happen.Englandrsquos deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said there needed to be a focus on care home staff.She said: ldquoWe need to focus equally not just on the residents but on the staff as well because these are quite closed communities.ldquoWe have been talking about the R in the community, where everybody has done so well to bring that number down, but of course workers who are working in care and health settings also are part of their local communities, so we need to make sure that we address infection and prevention control measures, and really make them robust.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted: ldquoMany warned care homes were highly vulnerable calling for a credible strategy to protect residents  care workers with PPEand accessible, regular testing.ldquoIf lsquoRrsquo now increasing because of social care surely exposes govt failures to implement infection control in social care.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\"
