Photograph: Joao Silva The New York TimesThe Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has urged Irish citizens caught up in the seven southern African countries affected by the latest Covid-19 travel restrictions to continue trying to find a way back to Ireland via “commercial means” and to maintain contact with their airline or travel agent. A DFA spokeswoman said on Sunday the Government was aware of the “limited availability and continued disruption to flights from the region” and Irish officials were liaising with people in South Africa and other affected countries through the Irish Embassy in Pretoria. The spokeswoman did not say whether the Government was planning a repatriation flight for Irish citizens in South Africa as it did last year for people caught in Peru, Nigeria and India when the pandemic first hit.“The situation is evolving quickly and additional measures affecting flights may be introduced at short notice,” she said. Paul Donnelly from Dublin was due to travel home from Cape Town on Friday night after spending a week in South Africa for work. He received a text from Air France while he was en route to the airport saying his flight to Paris had been cancelled. He then discovered the next available flight to Paris was one week away. He eventually found a flight via Amsterdam and booked “pretty much the last seat out of Cape Town on KLM”. Despite the international chaos unfolding around borders closing and flight cancellations, the atmosphere in the airport in Cape Town on Saturday was calm and orderly, he said. Mr Donnelly, who arrived home on Sunday afternoon, will now quarantine in his family home for the next 10 days. Having watched South African news reports over the weekend, he said there was a sense of frustration that the country was being blamed for this latest variant. “South Africans would probably see themselves as at the forefront of medical scientific research and for their genomic surveillance. They kind of felt like they were being punished for catching this and giving full disclosure.” The UK’s decision to immediately close its borders to South African travel was also a real slap in the face, he added. “The UK is their largest inbound tourist partner for people trying to get some winter sun. If it all shuts down, the economy will have a horrific time.”DiscriminationProf Tulio de Oliveira, who announced the news of the Omicron variant last week, took to Twitter urging the international community not to “discriminate or isolate” South Africa for being the country which sounded the alarm. “We have been very transparent with scientific information, he tweeted. “We identified, made data public, and raised the alarm as the infections are just increasing. We did this to protect our country and the world in spite of potentially suffering massive discrimination.” The world’s billionaires must now join together to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable can access the vaccine in order to combat Covid and “extinguish the variants”, he added in a Twitter thread.

Video: ReutersDr Allison Glass of the Lancet Laboratory in Johannesburg said there is no evidence that the new variant causes more severe disease. A clinical virologist at the laboratory in South Africa where the Omicron variant was detected has said that people who have tested positive for the variant are showing mild symptoms so far. Dr Allison Glass of the Lancet Laboratory in Johannesburg said there is no evidence that the new variant causes more severe disease. “From what we’ve seen so far, from the patients and doctors we have been in discussion with, the symptoms are mild currently. They are similar to symptoms we’ve seen from other Covid-19 variants,” Dr Glass told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “We are starting to see some hospitalisations but that is probably just a factor of the number of cases we’re seeing but as yet, there’s no evidence to suggest Omicron causes more severe disease than previous variants.”However, she expressed disappointment that travel restrictions had been imposed on South Africa when the reality was that such information was important to plan for a possible surge. She said that reactions as had been seen in the past few days could make the scientific community reluctant to be transparent “when there is this type of backlash”, she said.Many countries do not carry out genome sequencing and just because they were not aware did not mean there were no variants.“It’s disappointing that we’re being punished for being on top of what’s happening.”VigilanceDr Glass said that it was the vigilance of a junior scientist that identified the new variant.As a virologist Dr Glass said that she knew that the virus was going to continue to change. “that’s their nature - to evolve, it’s not unexpected.”It was good to be aware of what was happening. Knowledge was important for capacity planning, but it was early days, she said. “We shouldn’t jump to any conclusions.”Variants were a way of showing that the virus “will stick around,” but they should not cause panic, she urged.Meanwhile, a South African doctor who was one of the first to suspect a different coronavirus strain among patients said on Sunday that symptoms of the Omicron variant were so far mild and could be treated at home.Dr Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of South African Medical Association, told Reuters that on November 18 she noticed seven patients at her clinic who had symptoms different from the dominant Delta variant, albeit “very mild”.Now designated Omicron by the World Health Organization, the variant was detected and announced by South Africa’s National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) on November 25 from samples taken from a laboratory from November 14 to November 16.Coetzee said a patient reported at her clinic being “extremely fatigued” for two days with body aches and headache.“Symptoms at that stage was very much related to normal viral infection. And because we haven’t seen COVID-19 for the past eight to 10 weeks, we decided to test,” she said, adding that the patient and his family turned out to be positive.On the same day, more patients came in with similar symptoms, which was when she realised there was “something else going on.” Since then, she’s seen two to three patients a day.TransmissibleThe new coronavirus variant appears to be more transmissible than its predecessors although most cases have been mild so far, according to scientists advising the South African government. In South Africa, where omicron was first detected, officials said most new hospital admissions are unvaccinated, and anecdotal evidence suggests they are presenting with similar illnesses as before.At a briefing Monday, health experts said existing vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe effects. The emergence of the new mutation has sparked a global race to understand how quickly it spreads and how existing vaccines will respond. Cases have been identified in a number of countries, including Canada, the UK and Australia, and multiple governments imposed travel restrictions on South Africa and a number of neighboring countries. New daily cases in South Africa could surge to 10,000 by the end of the week, up from fewer than 3,000 on Saturday, according to Salim Abdul Karim, a clinical infectious disease epidemiologist. Heath department data shows omicron is now the dominant strain. While the increased caseload is expected to put pressure on hospitals, there is no need to panic, he said. “We know how to assess this and adjust our strategies accordingly,” Karim said during an online briefing on Monday. “Current treatments are still effective.” The government has so far eschewed imposing stricter curbs to slow transmission of the variant, but says it will reconsider its position over the next week. It’s also criticized the travel restrictions, saying there is no scientific evidence to suggest they work. “We are engaging leaders of various countries, especially those who have instituted these travel bans to convince them that this is very unnecessary,” Health Minister Joe Phaala said. “We are happy that we are supported by the World Health Organization in saying this.” Nicholas Crisp, the acting director general of the health department, said laboratories notified the government about the new variant on November 24 and a public announcement was made the next day. It was highly speculative to try to pinpoint how and where the strain originated, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"are you having difficulty finding a place to rent","story":"Are you having difficulty finding a place to rent?

Flights from seven southern African countries to Europe have been suspended as a result of the Omicron variant. In a statement, the DFA urged Irish citizens in South Africa to book on commercial flights including on BA and Virgin Atlantic. It added: “We will continue to monitor the situation, in coordination with our EU and other partners – including the necessity for organisation of future repatriation flights should commercial options become unavailable. In the meantime, we encourage citizens to avail of commercial flight options.“ The Department and embassy will notify those seeking consular assistance in the region of further confirmed travel options as they become operational, and will provide regular updates through the DFA press office and its social media accounts.” Those who do make it back to Ireland will be required to have a negativenot detected PCR test result taken 72 hours prior to arrival to Ireland. This will be irrespective of their vaccination status. They will then have to quarantine at home for 14 days from date of arrival at addresses on the passenger locator form and take PCR tests on day two and day eight of quarantine. If both post arrival PCR tests are negative, home quarantine will be ended after 10 days.The countries affected by the travel ban are South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. On Sunday the Irish ambassador to South Africa Fionnuala Gilsenan confirmed: “Good news as @British_Airways plan to resume flights by mid-week with Irish nationals able to transit via London. @dfatravelwise.” They have returned to their hotel base in Cape Town last night to isolate.

He stated that it was “very difficult situation” for the squad, but all of those who have returned negative tests can return home to Ireland “as quickly as possible”. They will have to do mandatory home quarantine for a period of at least 10 days. “Work is ongoing to find a route home for them.” There was better news for Ireland’s women’s cricket team who were playing a tournament in Harare, Zimbabwe. They are flying from Harare to Windhoek in Namibia and from there to Oman in the Middle East where they hope to be able to catch a flight back to Ireland.Deirdre McDermott (64), who is in Cape Town, is on a five week holiday in South Africa.

Photograph: Franck RobichonEPAScottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon as six Omicron cases detected in Scotland. Photograph: Fraser Bremner-PoolGettySix cases of the Covid-19 Omicron variant have been identified in Scotland, the Scottish government has announced.The Scottish government said that four of the Covid-19 Omicron variant cases identified in Scotland are in the Lanarkshire area, with two in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area.Public Health Scotland and local health protection teams are working together and contact tracing is being undertaken to establish the origin of the virus and any iniduals they have come into contact with.Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf said: “This will be a worrying time for the six people now identified as having the new variant. All will receive expert help and support and Public Health Scotland will undertake enhanced contact tracing in all cases.“There is still much to learn about the Omicron variant. Questions remain about its severity, transmissibility and response to treatments or vaccines and scientists are working at pace to provide additional information.“Until more is known we must be cautious and do everything we can to minimise the risk of spreading infection.” It comes as cases were detected across the continent as 13 cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant have been identified among team members of a professional football club, Portuguese health authorities said.The Ricardo Jorge National Health Institute said that one of those who tested positive is a player from the Lisbon-based Belenenses club who had recently travelled to South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first identified.The others, however, had not travelled to South Africa, indicating that this may be one of the very first cases of local transmission of the virus outside of southern Africa.Those who have been in contact with the positive cases have been ordered to isolate, regardless of their vaccination status or their exposure to possible contagion, and will be regularly tested for Covid-19, the institute said.Portugal also found two positive coronavirus cases when it screened 218 passengers who arrived in a flight to Lisbon from the capital of Mozambique on Saturday.One of the cases was the Delta variant and the other one could not be established, authorities said. The first probable case of the Omicron variant was detected in Switzerland, the government said late on Sunday, as the country tightened its entry restrictions to check its spread.The case relates to a person who returned to Switzerland from South Africa around a week ago, the Federal Office for Public Health said on Twitter.Testing will clarify the situation in the coming days, it added.Switzerland has ordered that travellers from 19 countries must present a negative test when boarding a fight to the country, and must go into quarantine for 10 days on arrival.The list includes Australia, Denmark, Britain, Czech Republic, South Africa and Israel. JapanMeanwhile, Japan has announced it will suspend entry of all foreign visitors due to the spread of the new coronavirus variant Omicron.Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida said the measure will take effect on Tuesday.The decision means Japan will restore border controls that it eased earlier this month for short-term business visitors, foreign students and workers.Over the weekend, Japan tightened entry restrictions for people arriving from South Africa and eight other countries, requiring them to undergo a 10-day quarantine period at government-designated facilities.Many countries have moved to tighten their borders after the new variant was found in a number of nations.Omicron was identified days ago by researchers in South Africa and much is still not known about it, including whether it is more contagious, more likely to cause serious illness or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.But many countries rushed to act, reflecting anxiety about anything that could prolong the pandemic that has killed more than five million people.Japan has not detected any Omicron cases so far. One traveller from Namibia was found to be positive for the coronavirus, and further tests were being conducted to find out if it was from the new variant, Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto said in a separate press conference. Nations around the world have enacted various border curbs since the WHO dubbed Omicron a “variant of concern.” But until Mr Kishida’s announcement, Israel had been the only country to ban all foreigners. – APReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"wobbling tories should stick pms bold interventionist vision","story":"The Tories are in a funk. MPs mutter about the Prime Minister. Cabinet ministers jockey for position. Pundits question the purpose and identity of the Government.Some complain ministers are spending too much. Some worry that without tax cuts and deregulation we are getting “the wrong Brexit”. Some believe that the Tory electoral coalition – comprising the so-called Blue and Red Walls – is simply impossible to serve and doomed to rupture. But is it really so?It is true, of course, that public spending rocketed during the cycle of lockdowns. But the furlough scheme and the interventions to keep firms alive while the economy was shuttered were extraordinary measures during a severe crisis. They successfully reduced the economic scarring and social costs of unemployment. But they tell us little about policy beyond Covid.One reason for higher spending – oddly overlooked by many tax campaigners – is that we are a rapidly ageing country. At the turn of the century, one in six of us was older than 65. Today, it is one in five of us, and within 20 years it will be one in four. By then, less than 60 per cent of the population will be of working age. So unless ministers want to slash spending on pensions, health and social care, the amount we spend overall – and the taxes we pay – will unavoidably increase.But another reason for higher spending is a conscious choice. For many of the supply-side reforms the economy needs do not require tax cuts and deregulation, but investment: in infrastructure and in the education and skills our country needs. Yes, we need to reform the property market and get more houses built, and yes, after Brexit we can do more to promote innovation in high-growth sectors such as tech and life sciences. But ministers have judged – rightly – that economic reform requires up-front investment.Those who dislike this direction of travel rarely explain what they would do to meet the growing costs of our ageing society, or how they would train and retrain the country’s workforce. Instead, they are taking their frustrations out on the Government’s two big missions: Brexit, and the aim to “level-up” the country. In both respects they are mistaken.Brexit was never going to be a neo-Thatcherite mission to shrink the state and turn Britain into a European Singapore. Most voters who backed Leave wanted national sovereignty, democratic control and stronger solidarity between citizens. Brexit was popular in places where workers had been squeezed by the bifurcating labour market, caused in part by globalisation. It was followed by a pandemic that highlighted the dangers of stretched global supply chains, a lack of domestic manufacturing capacity and exposure to the Chinese state. These all make the dream of libertarian Leavers even more fanciful.Neither is levelling-up some kind of luxury policy the country can afford to live without. If we want Britain to be a safe and prosperous place to live, we will need to fulfil the economic potential of all its cities, towns and regions. It is a simple question of fairness that opportunity and a good standard of living exist across the country. As the PM argued in his party conference speech, improving the economic performance of under-performing regions helps to take the pressure off London and the South East, where the housing market and transport infrastructure are under huge strain thanks to overpopulation.It is true that there will sometimes be tensions between the interests of the old Blue Wall of more prosperous constituencies and the newly won Red Wall seats. The profile of public spending is changing, ending the old bias in favour of the South East and doing more to help the regions. On the other hand, the social-care policy adopted by the Government benefits wealthier homeowners at the expense of working-age taxpayers and those with more modestly valued assets.But electoral coalitions always require politicians to make calls on who should be the winners and losers of policy. And eventually the coalition of Tory support will collapse, for that is the nature of changing events and democratic politics. But little suggests such a collapse is imminent.Labour is struggling to form its own winning coalition, and we should recall the original definition of Red Wall seats: they were places where demographics suggested that people could have voted Conservative but did not, usually voting Labour instead, thanks to locally specific cultures and habits. Tory voters are, on average, more provincial and less prosperous than they once were, but there is plenty – on economic and cultural issues – that can keep the new and old supporters together.With defensive by-elections approaching (a no-win situation for the talented new party chairman, Oliver Dowden), a mini-slump in the polls, and worries about political space for a challenge opening up from the Right, the Tories are not yet panicking, although the worrying and grumbling is undoubtedly growing louder.The solution to the funk is not to fantasise about unrealistic fiscal policies, nor to flirt with Covid libertarianism. If political space does open on the Right, it will be caused not by economic policies but by a failure to control immigration, cut crime and stand up to Left-wing culture warriors in public institutions and direct-action protests.And at a time when the Government’s competence is under attack, its handling of Covid – the vaccine programme, the avoidance of the surge in cases we see in Europe, and now a sensible response to the omicron variant – should be defended with confidence by Conservative MPs.The Tories need to go the whole hog with their strategy to become more interventionist in the economy, and more robust on culture. They must be competent enough to deliver the things they promise to do, such as sorting out the Channel crossings. And they should tell their story in a way that makes better sense, which means stopping Cabinet ministers running their own discordant and insubordinate campaigns.This wobble need not be the end of the world for the Tories, but they need quickly to get a grip, not lose their nerve.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: British socialite in New York court facing sex-trafficking chargesMacron accused of overlooking women for top jobs as he unveils almost all-male re-election teamFace masks unlikely to halt omicron variant’s spread, warns scientistIran aimed to create nuclear bomb, admits former head of atomic programmeMonday evening UK news briefing: Booster vaccine programme for all adults to fight omicron variantItalian football fan faces three years in jail for slapping backside of TV hostMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"allies britain israel can trade tech superpowers","story":"Many fear the skies are darkening worldwide due to the pandemic, the threat of terrorism and hostile actors seeking the upper hand. But we believe that, with the right approach, freedom and democracy will prevail.That is why Israel and the United Kingdom are today coming together in London to take a major step forward: transforming our close friendship into an even closer partnership by formally agreeing a new strategic plan for the next decade, ning cyber, tech, trade and defence.This pact will spur technological breakthroughs, which have the potential to change the world, create high-quality jobs in both our countries and provide tools to our security forces. But more than that, it is a victory for optimism.We believe that a democracy rooted in freedom – which empowers citizens with the opportunity to innovate, create, and fulfill their dreams – is the finest form of government. As outward-looking, patriotic nations, we know that the best way forward lies in building stronger economic, technological and security ties with like-minded partners.Our recovery from the pandemic will be fuelled by free enterprise, free trade and investment. We have built a trading relationship worth £5  billion, led by companies like Rolls-Royce supplying jet engines to Israel’s national airline and the Israeli pharmaceutical giant Teva now providing one in six of the NHS’s prescription medicines.But our great nations can do so much more to create jobs and fuel economic growth. That is why we will pave the way to negotiating a bespoke UK-Israel free trade agreement. We know the opportunities of the future will come from technology, which is why Israel and the UK are going further and faster to innovate. Our partnership will keep us at the forefront of the technological revolution and maximise our competitive advantage. The UK will also open its doors to high-growth Israeli tech firms.With the world increasingly threatened in cyberspace, we will work together to defend ourselves. Israel will officially become a tier-one cyber partner for the UK, recognising how much more we can achieve together as tech leaders with world-class cybersecurity expertise.As science and tech superpowers, Israel and the UK are putting our prowess into action, leading the world in our vaccine rollouts and in developing billion-dollar tech unicorns. It is no surprise that the UK was the first country to establish a special mission to Israel to boost tech cooperation, helping us set the standard for modern business.We know the world has to be safe for freedom-loving democracies. That is why we are working robustly as security partners. Our air forces now conduct regular exercises, and HMS Richmond showed the strength of our ties when docking in Haifa’s port, as part of the Carrier Strike Group’s global deployment.We stand united in condemning the appalling attacks on Israel and its representatives, from the shooting in Jerusalem last week by a Hamas militant to the unacceptable hounding of Israel’s ambassador, Tzipi Hotovely, outside the London School of Economics.There is no place for anti-Semitism anywhere in the world. That is why the UK has moved decisively to support Israel in this fight by proscribing Hamas in its entirety. The Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre, planned for near Parliament, will stand as a constant reminder, and demonstrate why we must stamp out anti-Semitism and hate.We will work night and day to prevent the Iranian regime from ever becoming a nuclear power.There is no greater sign of what can be achieved through open dialogue than the Abraham Accords. The UK was one of the first countries to celebrate publicly this historic step towards normalisation in the Middle East led by Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, and mediated by the United States.One year on, the UK is continuing to play its part in supporting Israel as it works more closely with partners in the region.Israel and the UK are the closest of friends, and today we become even closer. Together we ensure the future is defined by liberal democracies who believe in freedom and fairness.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: British socialite in New York court facing sex-trafficking chargesMacron accused of overlooking women for top jobs as he unveils almost all-male re-election teamFace masks unlikely to halt omicron variant’s spread, warns scientistIran aimed to create nuclear bomb, admits former head of atomic programmeMonday evening UK news briefing: Booster vaccine programme for all adults to fight omicron variantItalian football fan faces three years in jail for slapping backside of TV hostMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc radio 4s today programme drops air","story":"The BBC\u0027s flagship news programme temporarily dropped off air on Monday morning after a fire alarm instructed staff to leave the building.Radio 4\u0027s Today programme stopped broadcasting around 7.30am when staff were instructed to leave the premises, at BBC\u0027s Broadcasting House headquarters in London. Before the broadcast stopped, a voice could be heard saying Please leave the building immediately by the nearest exit.Journalist Nick Robinson, a presenter on Today, tweeted that staff had returned to the news studio shortly before 8am and confirmed everyone was safe.He said: Well that was interesting.

So far, just 17.5 million people have had them.However, health officials said that people would be prioritised in age order, with invitations continuing to be issued by age, as they ramp up capacity.  Vaccines were rolled out to those aged 18 and over in mid June, and 43 million people had their second jab at least three months ago. Last week, nearly 2.5 million third jabs were administered. If the rollout continued at that pace, it would take until March to give booster injections to all over-18s who come forward. At the same rate, if would take 10 weeks to administer boosters to all those who are now three months since their second jab. However, ministers have said they have asked the NHS “to prepare for much greater capacity in our vaccination programme.The committee also gave the green light to second jabs for children aged 12 to 15.Children aged between 12 to 15 are currently only offered one dose of the Covid vaccine.The precaution was taken because of evidence from other countries linking most cases of myocarditis to second jabs. However, most countries have shorter intervals between doses.Earlier this month Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said the rollout of jabs to adults in Britain - with a gap of between eight and 12 weeks - means there is almost no risk of myocarditis.The rollout of vaccines to secondary school pupils has been slowed by a change in the guidance, with children who have been infected with Covid told to wait three months before receiving their first jab.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, said there was currently a high degree of current uncertainty about the omicron variant.He told a Downing Street press conference: I do not want people to panic at this stage,” saying the current picture was not all doom and gloom.If vaccine effectiveness is reduced - as seems pretty likely, to some extent - the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects in preventing severe disease.There are far more things we don\u0027t know yet than things we do know.He said those gaps in scientific knowledge would be filled very rapidly, as experts around the world work on the problems over the next three weeks.In South Africa there was also an elevated growth rate associated with omicron, although that is not the same as saying there is definitely an increase in transmissibility compared with the delta strain.Professor Wei Shen Lim, chairman of the JCVI, said: “Having a booster dose of the vaccine will help to increase our level of protection against the omicron variant. This is an important way for us to reduce the impact of this variant on our lives, especially in the coming months.“If you are eligible for a booster, please take up the offer and keep yourself protected as we head into winter.”Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency, said: “The public can be confident that our robust regulatory assessment supports the JCVI’s recommended extension to the vaccination campaign. This further strengthens our ability to ensure people are protected against Covid-19 and saves lives.“Our safety monitoring to date shows that Covid-19 vaccines continue to have a positive safety profile for the majority of people. The vast majority of reactions which are reported relate to expected side effects such as injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms, as was seen in our initial assessment. Our proactive monitoring of the safety of booster doses does not raise any new concerns.”More from NewsMacron accused of overlooking women for top jobs as he unveils almost all-male re-election teamGhislaine Maxwell trial: British socialite in New York court facing sex-trafficking chargesFace masks unlikely to halt omicron variant’s spread, warns scientistIran aimed to create nuclear bomb, admits former head of atomic programmeMonday evening UK news briefing: Booster vaccine programme for all adults to fight omicron variantItalian football fan faces three years in jail for slapping backside of TV hostMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"funny always children lose covid restrictions","story":"Here we go again. Four months after that bold (correct) decision to go ahead with Freedom Day, we’re scuttling for cover. We face our first test and we’ve flunked it. The irreversible path to normality is not so irreversible after all.And, again, it’s our children who will suffer. No, not because of Covid, which is arguably less dangerous to them than cycling to school. But because of our terrified response to a variant whose symptoms the doctor who discovered it describes as - wait for it - “mild”.Yet that doesn’t stop the Government reintroducing isolation rules that will inevitably have a hugely damaging impact on our children’s education. Once again, perfectly healthy kids who happen to have been in contact with someone with this omicron variant will be forced to stay away from school and isolate for days on end – regardless of whether they test positive. They might not even have a sniffle, but they’ll be stuck at home playing video games, watching TV or just staring into space. Isn’t that wonderful.Who benefits? Do we really need to state the facts yet again? In the first year of the pandemic, around 100,000 people in the UK died after testing positive for Covid. Of these, just 0.025 per cent were children. That’s tragic for the families of those 25, of whom six were otherwise healthy. Awful and unthinkable. But during that same period, around 50 children were killed on Britain’s roads, and around 16,000 injured. Every year, hundreds of teenagers commit suicide. Where are the panicky measures for them?So, let’s not pretend that Covid restrictions – whether testing, bubbles, one-way systems, masks or stay-off-school orders – are for the benefit of children. The reverse is true. Disruption to education has been so bad that it would cost £15 billion to provide a catch-up service. Pupils lost half a year of progress. Many suffered mental health issues and domestic abuse. Skills relating to communication, fine motor and problem-solving are lower than they’ve been for many years. An Ofsted report bluntly states “Repeated isolation has chipped away at the progress pupils have made”.We know all of this, and more. Yet we are willingly, wilfully, about to put children through it all over again.If any other sector of society were discriminated against in such a brutal manner, we’d be up in arms. But not for children. Is that because they have no clear voice themselves? Or is it because many of the terrible effects of these restrictions, including long-term wage loss and even lower life expectancy, won’t become truly evident for years to come, long after the present crop of ministers and scientists have moved on? Or perhaps it’s because the Government is terrified of the teaching unions, who are gleefully flexing their muscles, demanding a return to those soul-destroying “bubbles” and insisting that Christmas activities be cancelled. That’s the festive spirit.It could be any of these things. But one thing we do know is that children’s education is way too important to be left to ministerial whim and hasty, panicky measures announced by an exhausted prime minister and a strangely nervous-looking Chris Whitty late on a Saturday afternoon.This Government is fond of U-turns. Maybe that’s a strength. More likely it’s a weakness. Either way, we need another one pronto. We need Boris or Sajid to get in front of the cameras and announce that school children will be exempt from these new isolation restrictions.Nobody knows what sort of a threat the omicron variant poses. It could well be a false alarm, albeit with a sinister-sounding name. But while we wait to find out, let’s not sacrifice our children, yet again. More from NewsJames Comey\u0026#39s daughter vs Bin Laden aide\u0026#39s lawyer as legal teams line up in Maxwell trialGhislaine Maxwell trial: British socialite in New York court facing sex-trafficking chargesMacron accused of overlooking women for top jobs as he unveils almost all-male re-election teamFace masks unlikely to halt omicron variant’s spread, warns scientistIran aimed to create nuclear bomb, admits former head of atomic programmeMonday evening UK news briefing: Booster vaccine programme for all adults to fight omicron variantMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown looms liberties tatters","story":"I uttered a howl of pain when the new anti-Covid restrictions were announced on Saturday. I turn 40 next year. My late 30s were stuck indoors I’m obviously going to spend the last flush of my youth behind a mask. I was planning to have a midlife crisis, but what’s the point in acquiring a ponytail and a Ferrari if there’s nowhere to go?The PM says these measures are designed to prevent a lockdown, but I am utterly convinced they’re the beginnings of one. If they are necessary because the omicron variant’s mutations mean it travels fast, and it has already been spotted nesting in the UK, logic suggests that cases will jump – which means more pressure on the NHS and on ministers to act. How many times have we been told “thus far and hopefully no further”, only for the PM to appear on television days later and admit, with regret, that we have to shut up shop?The Government says we should plan for Christmas as normal, but these are the same people who said we could travel to France or Spain earlier in the crisis only to reverse-ferret and give us a few days to get home.They don’t know what they’re doing because they don’t know what’s going to happen (we don’t have the data on how bad omicron is) and because there is no silver bullet for a pandemic. We are double-vaccinated. We have been offered a booster. We were encouraged to think that science would lick this thing, yet at the first sign of trouble, we return to the same blunt methods of disease control we introduced last summer.It’s true that we’re not fully locked down, and our rules aren’t as draconian as in parts of Europe, but don’t swallow the propaganda that these measures, however proportionate, are “light”. Cancelled travel means ided families. PCR testing and isolation on return from abroad will hit the travel industry hard. Isolation if you come into contact with a carrier is a recipe for another pingdemic. Then there are the masks, compulsory on transport and in shops, which might do some good and bring a little comfort, but are also irritating, uncomfortable and an invasion of our civil liberties. This matters, or should.A keen interest in human rights should extend from the prisoner in their cell to the migrant at sea, and yet the general population has been desensitised as to how unusual and unhealthy it is for a government to be able to order us to cover our faces without an immediate parliamentary vote – and with only a smattering of MPs predicted to oppose.Labour and the broadcast media will nudge ministers to go further the vast majority of voters will comply. We have normalised the extraordinary, accepting as inevitable phenomena that contradict the fundamentals of what I was taught was the British way of life, such as snooping, emotionalism and invasive policing. Someday, we’ll have to sit down with a pencil and paper and rewrite our national myth.I also suspect that these rules are not just for Christmas but the rest of my life, for there will long be variants – and always a crisis, be it another disease or a flood, to justify the reactivation of controls that this pandemic has invited. A precedent is set. The interesting question is when, or if, it can finally be broken.Last week, I was invited to give an after-dinner speech at the University of Oxford to flog my book – a black-tie affair that took a turn for the surreal. I enjoyed the soup, made by the students, and complimented them on their starter. Then came a salad. Next, a vegetable crumble. I glanced at the menu and discovered this was a seven-course meal.I’m normally in bed by 10pm. This descent into madness started at 7.30 and was still going strong at midnight – I hazily recall a salmon being placed in front of me – when I informed the president of the society that if he didn’t let me speak, I might fall asleep.Of course, the main reason why it was such a slog is that I’m 39 (I might’ve mentioned this before, but it’s weighing on my mind) and don’t drink alcohol, whereas the kids around me, all in their early 20s, regarded each course as a breather between bottles. I’d invited a friend along – a professor, also sober – who told me a boy seated opposite, very drunk, periodically leant across the table and said: “I ruv rine.”“I RUV RINE!” My friend was concerned that he might be asking for medical assistance, until he realised that he was in fact passionately declaring: “I love wine.”(The next day, the boy texted the professor: “I wish to apologise for anything I might have said or done last night.” The pro forma tone suggests it was sent to many people, and many times before.)I spoke. I got a standing ovation. To be honest, with a crowd like that, I could’ve led them in a chorus of Camptown Races and they’d have thought it was the Gettysburg Address, but it was gratifying. On a serious note, I found those that could still stand to be charming, well-informed and, on several levels, far cleverer than me – giving me faith that old England is not yet lost.Do not assume that the young are all woke bores.

You might have imagined that this new development is a matter for policy-makers who seek to steer us through an economic recovery while putting in place the necessary practical safeguards to prevent a spike in hospitalisations. But you would be wrong.To many, the Omicron variant is a welcome opportunity to impose, or reimpose, government restrictions on the way we conduct our lives. And those who resent or resist such impositions will find themselves neatly categorised under the same heading as Brexiteers, Trump supporters and opponents of trans self-identification.It\u0027s a wholly disingenuous process that makes false assumptions about our fellow citizens based on our own prejudices. The new ide in our society, it seems, is between those who relish the prospect of tougher mask-wearing and social distancing rules and those of us who can’t wait for all this to be over with.The journalist Dominic Lawson has written about the Left’s love of lockdowns — a scurrilous notion, until you actually start looking at the evidence. Lawson cites good examples, such as Professor Susan Michie, a member of the SAGE committee and a lifelong communist who seems to believe China’s strongarm anti-Covid tactics should be emulated here. Indeed I have noticed this yearning for restrictions, this disconcerting enthusiasm for anything that smacks of government diktat, during personal interactions with friends who are Labour Party supporters.One of my Facebook friends wrote indignantly about what seemed to him to be a life-threatening experience in a coffee shop. A stranger had sat in a seat opposite him to drink coffee. That’s it. The jeopardy started and ended with someone sitting near him. Given that my friend and his nemesis were in the coffee shop for the same reason — to drink coffee — masks were not worn. But my friend nevertheless took to Facebook to bewail the insensitive disregard that was apparently on show.Until this week, when the rules in England will change, I had relished the opportunity, when travelling by train from Glasgow to London, to remove my mask as soon as I arrived at Carlisle. This was not because I sought to flout the rules, but because we ought to be free to do as we like where the Government has chosen not to impose any rule.This approach seems to be anathema to many of my Labour friends, who appear to prefer it when Whitehall (or Edinburgh) lays down the law about when you can show your face in public and what shops and theatres you are allowed to frequent. Why do so many of my acquaintances seem to regard the prospect of another lockdown with such equanimity? It may well be because, unless you happen to be employed by the NHS, public sector workers (as so many Labour Party members and activists are) were paid to remain at home for long periods of time while being entirely confident that their jobs remained safe and sound.My perception is that there is a lack of empathy among many on the Left for people who work in the private sector, or indeed own a business, to whom the re-imposition of restrictions can cause great financial harm. Both the restaurant owner and the café barrister are expected to embrace financial uncertainty for the supposed greater good. I fear that even when, one day, we can at last leave all this behind us and return to normal, some of us will walk that path only reluctantly, for there will be many who insist on the voluntary wearing of masks indoors (and even outdoors). If not to prevent the spread of illness, then to remind everyone else who is a better person.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: British socialite in New York court facing sex-trafficking chargesMacron accused of overlooking women for top jobs as he unveils almost all-male re-election teamFace masks unlikely to halt omicron variant’s spread, warns scientistIran aimed to create nuclear bomb, admits former head of atomic programmeMonday evening UK news briefing: Booster vaccine programme for all adults to fight omicron variantItalian football fan faces three years in jail for slapping backside of TV hostMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"snp distract dismal record trying censure boris","story":"Tuesday Nov 30 is the feast of St Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland (and Russia, Greece, Ukraine and a host of other countries). In recognition of the date, the main business in the House of Commons has been given over to an Opposition Day for the Scottish National Party.Opposition Days are an opportunity for Labour and the other minority parties to highlight issues high up their agenda. We learned at the weekend that the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, intends to table a motion of censure against the Prime Minister, to concentrate the focus of the House on his personal failings as leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Government. A cynic might note that the party has chosen not to debate a policy area such as education, health or welfare certainly nothing that in Scotland is a devolved matter.Blackford is not a man short of bluster. When he rises to speak at Prime Minister’s Questions on a Wednesday, there is an audible groan from all sides of the House. Addressing his party’s conference on Sunday, he spoke of the SNP providing the “real opposition” – quite a boast for a party with 45 MPs in a House of 650, clearly intended as a slight at Labour’s lacklustre performance.“Unless he faces consequences for his disastrous actions, he won\u0027t just think he\u0027s gotten away with the mess he has made of the last few months – he will think he can do it all over again,” Blackford went on.The SNP then tweeted that the motion to be debated on Tuesday would underline the fact that Scots had “no confidence” in Boris Johnson’s leadership.There was a swift ‘clarification’. While the SNP seeks to demonstrate “no confidence” in the Government, it is not – as some incautious souls may have incorrectly assumed – tabling a motion of no confidence. Instead, Blackford will table a ‘motion of censure’, a broader and less formal instrument which usually comes in the form of an Early Day Motion. Motions of no confidence have specific consequences, and that is emphatically not the SNP’s style.Why does this matter? Because it is all related to Blackford’s mention of “consequences”. Quite apart from the Prime Minister facing them, it is the SNP leader who is afraid of them. He knows that a motion of censure will be defeated, and defeated heavily. Previous such motions, against Chris Grayling and Esther McVey during their time in cabinet, were soundly rejected. Confidence motions are serious constitutional business, and can lead to the collapse of governments. This ‘censure’ motion is just parliamentary chaff.Fair-minded readers might then wonder why Blackford would wish to pursue such an obviously doomed strategy. Is he some kind of latter-day Lord Raglan, ordering his troops into a disastrous action which can only end in defeat? Yes and no. Blackford knows that he does not have the numbers even to alarm the government. Johnson’s working majority is 77, so even the official opposition is powerless under normal circumstances.In the tartan-blinded world of the SNP, however, Blackford does not need to win. By choosing a motion of censure, he avoids taking on the government on central policy areas like education or health: areas in which the SNP administration in Edinburgh is failing badly. Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, twists and turns to avoid defending her record in office, preferring to concentrate on independence, the great panacea, and the supposed evils of the government in Westminster. So Blackford will try not to open his substantial flank to that kind of criticism.The focus will be Boris, Boris, Boris, because the Prime Minister’s personality and style are held to play less well in Scotland than they do south of the border. A recent poll found his approval rating to be -62, even worse that Sir Keir Starmer (-35). So, the SNP’s logic goes, play the man, not the ball.And heavy defeat in parliamentary terms suits Blackford too. It reinforces the idea of “them and us”, of Westminster against Scotland, of the SNP as a brave band of freedom fighters against the political establishment. Never mind that they have occupied Bute House, the official residence of the first minister, for 15 years. Scottish history is, in any event, littered with ‘noble’ defeats: Halidon Hill, Flodden, Solway Moss, Culloden.Ian Blackford knows what he is doing. Tomorrow he will line up his small band against the government’s big battalions, and, in parliamentary terms, it will be a massacre. But that suits him.

A decision from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationon expanding the programme and cutting the gap before a third dose could come as early as Monday. Health Minister Edward Argar said he had not yet seen formal advice from the JCVI, but “I hope it will come hopefully later today.” He added: “We’d expect that within the coming hours.” Teachers and pupils in Year  and above are now being strongly advised to wear masks in communal areas outside classrooms in England. They will become compulsory again on public transport and in shops from Tuesday, when isolation rules willfor international arrivals until they receive a negative PCR test. Close contacts of positive Omicron cases were being ordered to isolate for  days eventhey have been vaccinated under emergency measures announced over the weekend.  Britain will convene an urgent meeting of G health ministers on Monday to discuss the iant first detected in South Africa amid concerns it could spread rapidly and partially evade existing jabs. A third Omicron case was detected in the UK on Sunday, in a person with travel links to southern Africa who visited Westminster before leaving the country. It was thought the inidual visited the wider borough and not Parliament. The first two infections were identied in Nottingham and Essex, where officials were ordering PCR tests for customers of a KFC in Brentwood as far back as November . Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, acknowledged it was very likely that further cases of Omicron would be discovered in the coming days. Mr Argar told Sky News: Iaposll be honest with you and your viewers, I would expect that to rise. We don’t know by what speed or what numbers so therefore what we’re doing is trying to slow it down, but we’re clear we can’t stop it.But Health Secretary Sajid Javid told families they should plan for a great Christmas as normal and insisted it was nowhere near time to reintroduce social distancing rules and work-from-home guidance. It was hoped the new measures would buy time for scientists to gain greater understanding of Omicron as ministers put the NHS on notice to deliver many more vaccines every day. JCVI deputy chairman Professor Anthony Harnden said extending the age range for boosters and reducing the gap between second and third doses was a sensible strategy.He told BBC Radio aposs Broadcasting House that adults aged  to  should expect third jabs to be offered to them earlier than we had previously envisaged.The group was also considering whether second doses should be offered to - to -year-olds. Whitehall sources were hopeful the decision may come on Monday, but could not rule out Tuesday for the JCVIaposs announcement. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi recommended that staff, visitors and pupils in Year  and above should wear masks in communal areas in schools, colleges and universities such as corridors, canteens and halls in England from Monday. Though the reintroduction of masks in England in shops and public transport will bring the nation back closer into line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the face coverings are not being required in pubs and restaurants. Mr Javid said it would be irresponsible to make guarantees during the ever-changing pandemic, but he told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips on Sunday: I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think itaposs going to be a great Christmas. With the Government stopping short of introducing its plan B to tackle Covid- this winter, Mr Javid played down any need to reintroduce social distancing rules or work-from-home guidance. He warned of the very heavy price of additional restrictions, adding: So,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and weaposre not there yet, weaposre nowhere near that. Passengers arriving in the UK from am on Tuesday will be required to take a PCR test by the end of their second day from entry and isolate until they receive a negative test, while  southern African nations have been added to the red list. Mr Javid admitted that passengers flying in from southern Africa before  nations were added to the red list were not tested on landing and they could have taken public transport to get home. I think the speed at which we acted could not have been any faster, he told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC, adding that those arrivals had been contacted and told to take tests.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the bulk of the temporary and precautionary measures on Saturday, pledging that they would be reviewed in three weeks.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Coronavirus vaccineBoris JohnsonPoliticsMutant Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Omicron iant appears to have originated in South Africa and caused Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce the reintroduction of some restrictions in public, like mask-wearing.Refusing to wear a face mask in areas where they have been outlined as mandatory could land people with a £ fine. It is not yet knownthe new iant is more harmful and some doctors believe the symptoms to be milder to the ones caused by the Delta iant, but it is possible that it is more transmissible and more resistant to vaccines and nothing has been confirmed yet.Whether further restrictions will be put in place remains to be seen, but there seem to be no plans for a lockdown currently. The current restrictions are only minor, but what are they  Where do I have to wear a mask   People must wear shops on public transport or in shops unless they are medically exempt from doing so, but more places have also been announced by Health Secretary Sajid Javid.

This is doubled for each offence and could land people with an eventual fine of £,, which is the maximum.  The hospitality sector is exempt from the changes, so these rules wonapost apply in restaurants, cafes, bars or pubs. The UK, Italy and Germany have all now confirmed the presence of Omicron in their respective countries. The World Health Organisationcannot yet confirmthe virus is more easily transmitted orit is more resistant to vaccines. Currently, this is only suspected but is likely the reason behind the restrictions being reintroduced. In response, the government is also expected to announce the expansion of the booster jab scheme to make all adults eligible for it.

More details have been emerging overnight about the mask mandate to fight the Omicron Covid iant - with offenders expected to face £ fines. Under the previous fine rules, repeat offenders saw their fines double each time - up to a maximum of £,. Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that face coverings would once again be mandatory in shops and on public transport.Last night Downing Street confirmed the list of venues - to be published in full later today - would also include hairdressers, banks and post offices. Exemptions will include medical reasons and kids. But with Health Secretary Sajid Javid giving a .pm statement to Parliament today, ministers have had to defend the decision not to enforce face coverings in pubs or restaurants, even crowded ones.  Health Minister Edward Argar said people standing at the bar are often only there for a short time, and will then “sip a drink on the way back to their table, where they’ll be seated”. Mr Argar insisted “It’s about striking a proportionate balance,” adding: “It’s in the nature of the venue. In a pub you’re drinking. You can’t do thatyou’re wearing a mask.” However, government guidance does advise people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, and take a lateral flow test before socialising with other people. Mr Argar said: “We’re not making it a legal requirement but people will make their own judgements.” Restrictions are being tightened up this week after three cases of the Omicron iant were found in England and six in Scotland. Mr Argar told Sky News: Iaposll be honest with you and your viewers, I would expect that to rise.  “We don’t know by what speed or what numbers so therefore what we’re doing is trying to slow it down, but we’re clear we can’t stop it. Yet Mr Argar also claimed he was “looking forward to a Christmas spent with family and friends. Askedthe Government might tighten up the rules even further in the next three weeks, Mr Argar said: Itaposs not something Iaposm anticipating. Teachers and pupils in Year  and above are now being strongly advised to wear masks in communal areas outside classrooms in England. Ten countries have been added to England’s red list, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine. They are Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. From am tomorrow, all travellers to the UK will have to take a paid-for PCR test on or before day two after their arrival, and isolate until the result comes back negative. Meanwhile Covid booster jabs look set to be expanded to all over-s in the UK, down from over-s now. And the six-month minimum gap between second and third dose could be reduced. Health Minister Edward Argar said he had not yet seen formal advice from the JCVI, but “I hope it will come hopefully later today.” He added: “We’d expect that within the coming hours.” All contacts of suspected Omicron cases will also have to self-isolate for  days, regardless of whether they’re fully-vaccinated.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner urged action on £.-a-week Statutory Sick Pay, which still hasn’t been given a boost despite the furlough scheme ending. She told BBC Breakfast: If people have to self-isolate or go off sick they have to be given sick pay, itaposs one of the most crucial things we can do to ensure that everybody can do the right thing and protect people from this new iant.The booster jab should be given as quickly as possible, we said five months, hopefully that will happen now, and there should be ventilation in schools. People should be wearing masks, including the Prime Minister when heaposs visiting public spaces indoors.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON BBCBoris JohnsonPublic transportPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the wake of the latest Tory sleaze allegations, Deputy Leader Angela Rayner will tell a Whitehall think tank that an independent Integrity and Ethics Commission is needed to replace the current “alphabet soup of dferent committees and advisers”. It would have powers to probe ministers, make decisions on sanctions for misconduct and ban former ministers from any job linked to their former role for at least five years after they leave office.The plans come after recent lobbying scandals involving former Prime Minister David Cameron and ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond. Calls for an overhaul of the system for investigating current ministers has grown after Boris Johnson opted not to sack Home Secretary Priti Patel when she was found to have bullied staff, and over the financing of the redecoration of the Prime Minister’s Downing Street flat. Ms Rayner will tell the Institute for Government: “The current system does not work and it has failed. “It only works where there is respect for the rules and there are consequences for breaking them. “Because of Boris Johnson there is no respect for the results and no consequences for breaking them. “The current regime is no longer working precisely because we have a Prime Minister who is shameless in breaking the rules, and won’t enforce consequences on others who break them. “Corruption – that is the word – is happening in plain sight and it is re right through this Conservative Government.”The Commission would “integrate and strengthen the fragmented system responsible for investigating and upholding standards across government”, said Labour.It would be able to open investigations into misconduct and breaches of the Ministerial Code - replacing the role of the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests. The watchdog would also “set binding sanctions for breaches of the Ministerial Code”, recommend updates, and “ban former ministers from lobbying, consultancy or any paid work related to their former job for at least five years, closing the revolving door between ministerial office and lobbying for companies they used to regulate, and have the power to impose sanctions on former ministers who break the rules”. It comes after a torrid few weeks for Mr Johnson, with a new Opinium poll showing Labour maintaining its narrow lead over the Tories.  Keir Starmeraposs party had % of the vote share , with the Conservatives on %, according to the survey conducted between November -. Mr Starmeraposs approval rating is now at+% , well ahead of Boris Johnson who is on -% . Health Secretary Sajid Javid was grilled on whether Mr Johnson would lead the Conservatives into the next election amid unrest among Tory backbenchers over his handling of issues like sleaze.

Boris Johnson reintroduced mask-wearing rules to fight the spread of the “worst ever” Covid iant, Omicron, this week.The new rules are set to become enforceable by penalty when a regulation change is tabled in Parliament on Monday, giving new powers which will begin on Tuesday at am. Anyone who forgets and refuses to wear a mask will face a £ fine the first time, but the charge will double for each offence. This will make it £ the second time, £ the third - up to £,. But the rules will not apply to the hospitality sector in restaurants and pubs, at concerts or events - nor can Parliament force MPs to wear them in the House of Commons.Health secretary Sajid Javid defended the system which, as last year, will allow people to half their fine by paying within the first two weeks. Speaking to Sky News he said: “Doing it in this proportionate way where itaposs for public transport, itaposs for retail outlets, I think is the right level of response on masks. “It will be via government regulation and that means, I think, that people will take it seriously. Critics have asked why the scheme only applies to shops and transport, while others warned it would be incredibly dficult to enforce. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, told Theit would be train workers who would be left to deal with angry passengers who did not want to wear masks. He said: We support the wearing of masks but there are major issues about enforcement and it is our members left in the front line with angry passengers who refuse to comply.  He added that the Government should make “resources available to police this reintroduction of masks”, and to end its “disjointed approach and get some consistency that avoids the chaos and confusion that is a hallmark of this administration”. Shop workers and retail staff have also expressed concerns with theof the rules. James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said: We are helping retailers to prepare for the change in face-covering rules, but they are extremely concerned about abuse against their staff from customers who donapost want to wear a face covering in a shop.  We will continue to urge stores to communicate the rules, but not to challenge those who refuse to abide by the rules. Supermarkets across the UK are now waiting on Government advice before they release further information to customers over what the rules will mean in store.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON House of CommonsBoris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsFace Masks\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Javid said masks would become mandatory in shops and on public transport from Tuesday in England, with all international arrivals told to take PCR tests and isolate until they receive the result. All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days - eventhey are double jabbed - as there are fears the new strain may be able to evade existing vaccines. Mr Javid said the Government hoped these changes would be temporary and said people should plan for Christmas as normal.  He told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips on Sunday: I think itaposs fair to say that the nature of this pandemic is it would be irresponsible to make guarantees. As for Christmas, I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas. I think itaposs going to be a great Christmas. Askedthe Government would introduce working from home or social distancing measures, he said: We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health. So,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and weaposre not there yet, weaposre nowhere near that. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas been asked to look at extending the booster programme to under-s, with advice expected within the next few days. Boris Johnson set out the changes at a hastily-arranged Downing Street press conference on Saturday but he was criticised for being too vague on the details.The PM has resisted imposing plan B of the Governmentaposs Covid winter plan, which also includes ordering people to work from homepossible and vaccine passports.  The new restrictions are due to be laid before Parliament on Monday, with a vote for MPs within  days.Lockdown-sceptic Tories may stage a rebellion but it is unlikely to success as Labour usually supports the Government on Covid restrictions. However Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the party wants the Government to tighten up travel restrictions. She said questions remain around the scientic advice provided on mask wearing, the very little action on ventilation in public buildings and questions on travel restrictions. Ms Nandy said: The Government is saying everyone has to have a PCR test on day two when they arrive back in the UK, but theyaposre not suggesting pre-departure tests for people before they board flights. Thereaposs no advice for people about travelling back from the airport on public transport and there are very few checks on the PCR tests that are done. So, these are all things that for months the Government has been warned about. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache but none of the usual Covid symptoms. She told the BBC: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent.

Heads were told to make sure they have enough supplies so all pupils can be given a lateral flow test when theyto the classroom in January. In an email to schools on Friday, the Department for Educationsaid it would help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the festive period.But union leaders accused the Government of treating heads like an ad hoc branch of the NHS .It comes as Britain braces to see the impact of a worrying new Covid iant first detected in South Africa, which has now been found in the UK. Two cases of the Omicron iant have been identied in Essex and Nottingham, prompting Boris Johnson to front a hastily-arranged press conference on Saturday announce new measures to halt its spread.Face coverings will be mandatory in shops and on public transport again from Tuesday, while all international arrivals will soon be required to take a more costly PCR test and isolate at home until they get their result. All contacts of an Omicron case will have to isolate at home for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. Around , pupilsin state schools were out of class due to Covid on November , down from ,on October , according to the DfE. But some schools have been forced to shut temporarily or send children home due to absence rates among staff and pupils. The Government guidance says schools should only send large numbers of children home in extreme cases and only as a last resort. On Friday, the DfE emailed school leaders to advise them to prepare for mass testing after Christmas. The email said: We would like all secondary schools to prepare to test their pupils once on-site onin January. We understand that this is a signicant additional ask but testing continues to play a vital role in keeping Covid- out of schools. Secondary schools have also been asked to order home testing kits so pupils can continue to test.  The email said: Testing all pupils in school boosts testing participation and will help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the school holidays. Tests, PPE and funding to support your workforce will be provided as before. After this test on , pupils should continue to test in line with Government guidelines. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders , said: We recognise the importance of Covid testing to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, but it is not reasonable for the Government to once again impose this considerable public health task on schools with minimal support. The role of schools should be limited to providing a space for test centres and communicating with students. But the Government expects them also to handle the logistics of staffing and setting up testing stations. It seems to have forgotten that school leaders are educators rather than an ad hoc branch of the NHS. Their focus is on providing the teaching and learning required by their students, which is particularly important in the context of the disruption caused by the pandemic. The last thing they need is another huge responsibility which does not even fall within the remit of education. At the start of the autumn term, all secondary school and college pupils in England were invited to take two lateral flow tests at school on their . Pupils were then asked to continue to test twice weekly at home. A DfE spokesperson said: As part of our commitment to protecting face-to-face education, we are asking all secondary school pupils to complete one on-site test as theyto school after the Christmas break, reflecting that mixing between households is likely to increase over Christmas. Protective measures in place continue to strike a balance between managing transmission risk with testing, hygiene, ventilation and vaccines, and we encourage any eligible young people who havenapost yet had the vaccine to consider using the Christmas break to do so.

While Iaposm doing all that, the vast majority of the worldaposs scientic and medical community work hard at a thing that doesnapost exist.They map the genome of something created by man, they design, deliver, then update vaccines we donapost need, and they cover themselves in PPE for  hour-shts to tend people at risk of dying from a disease they have no risk that kills hardly anyone. They expend huge amounts of time, sweat and effort doing all that, and then invent the information to share with the rest of the world, because every epidemiologist on the planet wants YOU, yes YOU, to have your freedom curtailed by the wearing of a mask when you spend  minutes in the chippie. Why wouldnapost Chris Whitty happily get assaulted in the street for that When Skyaposs political editor-at-large Adam Boulton gets together for a beer with Kaye Adams off Loose Women, they have a right old laugh about how well the conspiracy is going.

And the only people to tell you about this are renowned vaccinologist Carol McGfin, a nurse whoaposs not allowed to nurse anymore, failed weatherman Piers Corbyn, and a handful of priests whose imaginary friend is a bit suspect. We still await the answer on what, exactly, thousands of journalists, millions of medics, and the entire scientic community stand to gain from doing Mr Gatesapos bidding, but presumably we can at least expect a free copy of Office .

Much of science and medicine, by comparison, is helping with this pandemic for free.

Jan and Mick Sturla, , from Kent, treated themselves to a  day safari vacation to Elephant Plains, South Africa - flying out on Sunday November , before the new strain was even detected. But following the announcement of the first case by the World Health Organisation on Wednesday , the retired couple saw all flights out of the country cancelled and began fighting to get home as soon as possible. The grandparents of four have endeavoured to contact airline British Airways and the British Embassy, but have been given no concrete answers about when the Government will collect its citizens. Speaking through tears, their only daughter, Louise Peters,  said: “I’m scared for their safety they are  and vulnerable I’m worried people will look at them and see them as targets.  “The chances of getting them home for Christmas are looking increasingly slim. My mum couldn’t even talk this morning, she was so upset. “The Government know there are going to be cancelled flights, they need some sort of backup option. “As for British Airways there is a message on their website about customer care being their utmost priority but all my parents have had is a text message telling them that flight is cancelled. It’s obvious they just don’t really care.” After the WHO confirmed the first case of Omicron on Wednesday, the couple received a text message from British Airways cancelling their flight home which was booked for Tuesday,  November.  Mr and Mrs Sturla say they were told they would have to pay £, to self isolate in a Government approved hotel for  days as they would be ing from a red list country. The couple drove eight hours from Elephant Plains to OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg in a desperate attempt to get home in time to be out of isolation for Christmas, but claim all flights to the UK were cancelled. Following several back and forth calls with their travel agent, the grandparents decided to try instead flying to another country, booking flights first to Dubai and then Mauritius - but both times were turned away at the last minute. Louise estimates they have spent between £, and £, in flights, accommodation, tests and travel as they continue to try and get home.  Louise said: “They drove eight hours through the night to get to the airport and do the PCR test only to be told at the desk that they wouldn’t be allowed on the flight because these countries are only accepting their citizens as arrivals from South Africa. The cost of trying to come home is running into the thousands, they say that they are spending money like water. “People that live in Britain need to be able to come back to this country. “No one has given them any information, they’re just getting hearsay on the rumour mill that there might be a British flight home in two weeks.  “All the Australians, people from the US or Mauritians have been given a flight time to come home while all of the Brits are just wondering around the airport aimlessly. “It’s not good enough. “They have known about this new strain of the virus for nearly a week so why haven’t they made a plan about how they are going to get people back to the UK.  “Have they learnt nothing from the first months of the pandemic when people were stranded all over the world for weeks  “It feels like the same thing is happening again, history is just repeating itself.” The Foreign Office did not provide a statement but claimed that British nationals currently in South Africa and affected countries should make use of the commercial options availablethey wish toto the UK. It added that no travel is without risks but that the FDCO would respond rapidlyrisks from any country increase. A spokesperson for British Airways said: “We continue to do everything we can to support all customers whose travel plans have been affected as a result of the UK Governmentaposs temporary ban on flights from South Africa. We’re looking into this specic case and will ensure the customers are contacted to discuss their options.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World Health OrganisationBritish AirwaysForeign Office\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ian Brown, , was left scratching his head when he was delivered a damaged box with no product inside. The package was supposed to hold £ worth of skincare products and bin bags, which were ordered by his girlfriend on the Amazon website. He claims as he watched over his footage again, he observed the driver photographing the item asto show it had been successfully delivered. Mr Brown stated that usually for his deliveries, the driver knocks on his front door. He claimed he saw the driver at the side of his house and heard him aposgigglingapos.  He said: “It was sort of mischievous laughter. I could see the parcel and it was completely flat. I thought ‘he cannot have delivered that. “But when I went back to the CCTV I found it had been put behind some flower pots and photographed it. Ian maintained he was not awareit had been deliberately taken out or had fallen out but nonetheless called the service aposunprofessionalapos. Amazon has now refunded the couple for the skincare products and replaced the bags. Despite the reimbursement, Mr Brown is concerned about the goodwill gesture affecting any possible future circumstances when he will need a refund. He argued thatsomething higher value went missing from his package, it would be his word against the driver. He added: “If the driver spots the parcel is damaged they are supposed to knock and wait for you to open the door and reject it. Now Mr Brown has been left scarred from the ordeal, stating he is afraid to purchase any more items from Amazon. He said: “None of the process for a genuinely damaged parcel has been followed. I wanted to buy an Xbox off Amazon but there is no chance in hell of that now, or of buying anything of value. “Although this parcel was heavy it contained nothing of value. But you would not know from outside. “Something has gone wrong here and it needs investigating.” However Amazon has responded, stating they have worked with the customer to ensure things are solved. A spokesperson from Amazon told : We’ve worked directly with the customer to make things right.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON AmazonCCTVCCTV footage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: PAByAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov A stepmum accused of murdering a boy has pleaded guilty part-way through her trial to cruelly beating the six-year-old. Emma Tustin, who is also accused of killing stepson Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, changed her plea to the count of child cruelty today. The boyaposs father Thomas Hughes, , and Tustin, are both on trial accused of murder after Arthur suffered an unsurvivable brain injury in June . Tustin, , is alleged to have carried out the fatal assault while Arthur was in her care. She took a photo on her mobile phone of the little lad as he lay dying in the hallway of her home in Solihull, West Midlands, jurors at Coventry Crown Court have been told. Tustin previously pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial to another count of child cruelty - ill-treating Arthur on multiple occasions by forcing him to stand, isolating him within the family home, and physically or verbally intimidating him.  Hughes is accused of aiding and abetting in the murder, including by sending a text message to Tustin before Arthuraposs fatal collapse telling her kidaposs getting ended when I get back. Prosecutors have alleged the pair carried out a campaign of cruelty, amounting to torture, against Arthur, in which he was force-fed salt-laced meals, kept isolated in the home, starved, dehydrated and routinely beaten. Mary Prior QC, Tustinaposs barrister, told jurors her client had admitted in her own evidence to three assaults... all captured on CCTV, occurring between June  and  , leading to her change of plea.  Tustin claimed Arthuraposs fatal head injury was self-inflicted, possibly by throwing himself down the staircase in her hallway, where he was forced to spend  to  hours a day, the court heard. During his evidence, Hughes claimed Tustin mentally abused and gaslighted him into complying with the punishing disciplinary regime, but also admitted lying to school staff who were checking on Arthuraposs progress during the first Covid- lockdown. Today, the jury heard the last of the evidence in Hughesapos defence, including from a woman who shared a cell with Tustin while she was awaiting trial for Arthuraposs murder.  Elaine Pritchard was Tustinaposs padmate at HMP Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire in November . She said she trashed the cell and ordered Tustin out after reading that Arthur had suffered about  separate injuries. Ms Pritchard, , told jurors she has an extensive record of offending linked to drug and alcohol abuse, including assaults and drink-driving. Ms Pritchard was asked about an argument she had while sharing a cell with Tustin, which ended with her calling the prisonaposs guards to have her cellmate removed. In evidence, she said she had spotted Tustinaposs case paperwork lying on a side table.  She said: I saw a comment from the paramedics, and  bruises. On his body. And that she showed no emotion. Bernard Richmond QC, representing Hughes, asked: How did she know that you had seen that  Ms Pritchard replied: Because I ended up throwing her out of the cell. She added: I asked her, why wouldnapost she know that a boy had all those injuries  I asked her about when she had bathed him or showered him. She said aposOh, I didnapost do that, I just used to give him a towelapos. I was quite angry at the fact someone had  bruises on their body.  Asked what Tustin did when Ms Pritchard got angry, she claimed: She was sat on her bed or on the chair, with her knees up, and I just started throwing her stuff into the corner of the room, saying aposYouaposre getting out, youaposre goingapos. I pressed the alarm bell for the staff, I feared I would end up staying in the prison. Ms Pritchard then alleged in court: She said to me aposYou had your kids taken off youapos and I said aposYeah, I did, but youaposre not going to get your kids back, youaposve murdered a little boy, youaposve killed a boyapos. She wasnapost interested the only thing she spoke about was her own children, she never spoke about Arthur. Hughes denies a charge of child cruelty through ill treatment, as well as a further child cruelty allegation of wilfully assaulting Arthur on multiple occasions. The pair also both deny allegations of child cruelty by administering salt to Arthur between June  and  last year, and by withholding food and drink. Hughes and Tustin also both deny murder and the trial continues with the judge now giving the jury legal directions.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Thomas HughesCCTVMurderPrisonsCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtMurder trialCrimeDrink-driving\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She was too weak to drink so was given a piece of wet kitchen roll to suckJoan Massey waited on the floor for  hours for ambulance to arrive after she fell down Image: SWNSByAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Nov | commentsA blind woman who was left lying on the floor waiting for an ambulance for nearly  hours was forced to suck a tissue for moisture. Joan Massey, , fell inside her Birmingham home on November , where a family member found her and called an ambulance at about am. She was unable to drink while on the floor and was given a wet kitchen roll to suck on by her family. The family said they eventually managed to spoon water into her mouth as they waited  hours for help to arrive. West Midlands Ambulance Service has since apologised and said it is dealing with high levels of demand. Wendy Massey, , who is Joanaposs daughter-in-law, said: She was on the ground for more than  hours.  Though we have no idea actually how long she was down before that. She does wear a helpline around her neck, but being in the situation she had clearly forgotten she had it. She added: Helen Brooks [my sister-in-law] rang  at about quarter past ten, and was with her the whole time. Obviously Joan was uncomfortable for a lot of that time and wanted to move and needed the loo, which is dficult because in that situation you canapost be moved. Sheaposs a blind lady. So she was in a dark world all that time and not knowing what was happening to her. Her hearing is extremely poor as well. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Wendy said her husband went up around pm - seven hours later - and rang the ambulance again. She added: He had to feed her some water with a wet bit of kitchen roll because she was in such an awkward position and so uncomfortable. Eventually he used a teaspoon to feed her some sparkling water after she became very thirsty. Each time we phoned the ambulance they said they were very sorry and that they were busy. We know that and donapost expect special treatment - I understand fully that other emergencies take priority. But  hours! Weaposre actually only about  minutes away from the main Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. She really looked like a frail old lady at that point. My husband called the paramedics again. She continued: It was about quarter past eleven at night when the paramedics knocked on the door. They dealt with her very quickly. They checked her over and didnapost think anything was obviously broken. Then they popped out this lilo thing and transferred her - with her screaming in pain sadly, and she isnapost a lady to complain. Wendy alleges that since being admitted to the hospital there had been continual failures in communication between the hospital and the family, leading to confusion over where and how she is. She said: She has since had an X-ray to seeanything is broken, which happened on Thursday, and apparently the doctor was supposed to call on Saturday, but nobody has yet. When Joan arrived at the hospital, doctors apparently discovered she was suffering from a urinary infection, which is a common cause of falls among elderly people. Joan has since gone through treatment and her daughter Helen is in contact with the hospital on her condition.A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: “We would like to apologise to Mrs Massey and her family for the delay in responding. “Unfortunately, the whole of the NHS remains under severe pressure which is being felt intensely in our service in the West Midlands hospital handover delays, unfortunately, mean patients are waiting longer for an ambulance response. Unfortunately, we were also dealing with high levels of demand from people with le-threatening conditions. We are working with all local partners across the health and care system to reduce delays so crews can respond to the next incident as quickly as possible and staff and volunteers continue to work tirelessly to respond as soon as we can.“We are continuing to bolster frontline and control room staffing and have introduced a number of measures to help manage pressures in the service.

The nine-year-old dog loves walks, cuddles and attention, and nearly hit the jackpot when a potential owner showed interest in the lurcher last weekend. But the adoption fell through after years of failed rehoming attempts. The poor pooch hasn’t got it statistically easy, with black dogs typically being more dficult to rehome, and lurchers often end up in shelters.  Dillon has never lived with or walked with another dog before his owner’s death, and during his time at the Cornish rescue, has seen countless other dogs come and go while he patiently waits his turn. The Lurcher, who is a young dog at heart, was taken into a shelter at the National Animal Welfare Trust when he was found protecting and watching over his elderly owner after they passed away. After a trial living with another dog, it was clear this wasnapost going to be an option as Dillon is too used to being an only child to share. Following the trial he was back at the centre again, and it was time to try and find him a new owner based in Cornwall and more have fallen through in that time.

In an update posted this weekend, National Animal Welfare Trust said the team was absolutely devastated to share the news that Dillon would be staying with them a little longer. Through no fault of his own the customer decided they would wait for a Labrador as they don’t usually own lurchers and one that could play with family dogs that visit, they wrote, saying that most people who had enquired already had other pets, which would not be suitable.Amy Hall, Fundraising and Supporter Relations Officer for NAWT, says he is a deeply loving and affectionate pet. She said: Heaposs a really great dog, but he just needs the right person. Weaposve had a few people interested but for one reason or another theyaposve not quite worked out. The thing with his age is he attracts people looking for more of a dog that sits with you, whereas Dillon in his heart is still a bit of a puppy. He will settle down with you and relax too, but he likes to go out in the fields and have a nice walk - after which he likes to just chill.

Covid Passes allow you to share the details of your vaccination or tests results securely and can provide information about your vaccination when travelling abroad. It is recommended that all people who are eligible for a Covid Pass familiarise themselves with how to get one. Do I need a Covid Passport   All four members of the UK have the power to make their own decisions about how to proceed, meaning that no one rule applies across the entire country. Will I need a vaccine passport in Northern Ireland  People in Northern Ireland will need to use the new Covid Passport to enter a range of events and venues. Nightclubs, food and drink selling hospitality venues, cinemas, concert halls and larger spaces will all require the pass to be shown in order to gain entry. Larger venues include unseated indoor live events of more than  people, unseated outdoor live events of more than , people or any event of more than , people. Vaccine passports in Scotland  The locations needing a pass in Scotland are similar to Northern Ireland: Nightclubs, food and drink selling hospitality venues, cinemas, concert halls, indoor live events of more than  people, unseated outdoor live events of more than , people or any event of more than , people. From the th December people will be able to show proof of a negative test rather than just of a vaccination for their passport to be valid. The Scottish scheme will not be expanded under the current plans, despite the the Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon having weighed up whether to add cinemas and other hospitality venues to the places requiring the passes. Will I need a vaccine passport in Wales   Wales again has the same requirements as Scotland and Northern Ireland: Nightclubs, food and drink selling hospitality venues, cinemas, concert halls, indoor live events of more than  people, unseated outdoor live events of more than , people or any event of more than , people.Wales is dferent to the other parts of the UK as you cannot get your NHS Covid Pass on the NHS appyou live there, and instead need to get a printed or downloaded copy.Vaccine passport rules in England Plans for a Covid Passport have been dropped for England, however people from England can use the NHS app in other parts of the UK that require them. It is available to people that have been fully vaccinated for two weeks, had a negative lateral flow in the last  hours, or have had a positive PCR but have now finished self isolating.Will I need a Covid Passport to travel abroad   The requirements of travelling abroad are ultimately down to the destination country, with one likely to be needed to prove your vaccination status before leaving the UK. Many countries will require that visitors are fully vaccinated, or will waive the need to quarantineso. Before departure you will need to make sure you have fulfilled the requirements of both the UK and your destination country.For the most up to date information about travel, seek out UK government advice.How to apply for a Covid Passport  You can get the Covid Passport on the NHS app or through the NHS website using your NHS login. It can also be sent as an email or downloaded as a PDF.

The next day, Essex County Council announced that contact tracers were focusing on iniduals who had attended the branch KFC, as well as those who had visited a local church. Visitors to the KFC between pm and pm on November  are being urged to take a PCR test immediately. Members of the congregation who visited Trinity Church, two days later, were asked to do the same. They are being urged to attend mobile testing units, for drive-through appointments only. It has been reported that the Brentwood case is linked to the other infection in Nottingham, with the latter inidual understood to have arrived from southern Africa before coming into contact with the person in Essex. Essex county council’s director for public health, Dr Mike Gogarty, said: “Thanks to the excellent work of our contact tracers, we have been able to identy settings which are the focus of our attention for testing. “The aim is to understand what,any, spread of the new iant within the local community may have occurred and limit the opportunity for any further spread. Robust contact tracing has taken place following identication of the single case.”  On Sunday, the UK Health Security Agency announced a third case of the Omicron iant in the UK. The inidual concerned, who is also believed to have travelled from southern Africa, visited Westminster in London before leaving the country. They are understood to have visited the wider borough rather than parliament or Whitehall. A spokesperson for the council yesterday confirmed the Essex inidual had previously traveled to South Africa. The spokesperson said: We are working with regional and local public health officers who are assessing the situation. All close contacts of these iniduals will be followed up and requested to isolate and get tested.

But in nations such as Nigeria and Ethiopia little over % are fully inoculatedA child receives a Covid jab in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsAs wealthy countries pray jabs will protect them from the new Covid iant, many struggling nations cannot fall back on that hope. We can boast of upping our booster rollout while only .% of the world’s population has a dose of a vaccine at all. There are glaring gaps in coverage with numerous countries, many developing nations in Africa where new iant Omicron was first detected, seeing vaccination rates in single percentage figures only. More than % of us are double jabbed, and in countries including China and Spain the percentage is higher still. But in nations such as Nigeria and Ethiopia little over % are fully inoculated.  South Africa has only .% of its population fully vaccinated. These low rates can allow new iants to mutate, and are why critics argue richer nations should act quickly to donate doses to those in need.Yesterday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown criticised Boris Johnson for claiming the issue in these countries has “not been supply, but hesitancy and lack of take-up”.Mr Brown, World Health Organisation ambassador for global health financing, said: “The biggest problem is not the reluctance of people in Africa to be vaccinated but the failure of the West to honour our promise to supply the doses.” He explained the UK has only pledged  million doses to poorer countries, behind the EU’s  million and the US’s one billion, and in five months released just % of those. He argued hoarding is “leaving all of us at risk when – through no fault of their own – countries have become spaces for outbreaks of new iants of the virus”.Mr Brown said leaders should lt intellectual property restrictions on coronavirus vaccines, so countries in need can produce their own jabs. World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also criticised countries for stockpilingvital vaccines.He said: “Every day, there are six times more boosters administered globally than primary doses in low-income countries. “This is a scandal that must stop now.”  Here, a map of the world illustrates the stark gaps between nations’ vaccine rates using figures from Our World in Data.

Recognisable worldwide and an emblem of British society, we are used to seeing Her Majesty in brightly coloured outfits carrying out official engagements. And in her time on the throne, the world has drastically changed - including the powers she actually has. We might think the Queen doesnapost have any real clout, as this goes to the government and Prime Minister instead. But she has several surprising abilities from the randomto the paramount , though she rarely exercises this.As the Queen has been forced to scale back her duties as she recovers from a sprained back, itaposs often wonderedshe will pass the baton onto her son, Prince Charles.This is unlikely, but it has left many people thinking about the powers the Queen actually has. Owning the swans, whales and dolphins Get the news you want straight to yourinbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. As the song goes, Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves. Well, the Queen does actually technically rule whataposs underneath them. In a centuries-old tradition, she owns all of the unclaimed mute swans in open water in England and Wales, but only actually exercises ownership on certain stretches and tributaries of the River Thames around Windsor. This bizarre legislation was created back in the s, when swans were coveted as fancy food in banquets and feats, and rights of ownership were granted by the Queen to a select and lucky few. Hundreds of years ago, swans were carefully guarded and counted, and there were severe penalties for killing or injuring one - and you could even face prison for stealing an egg. Swans are no longer eaten today and are in fact a protected species - it was legally treasonous to eat them right up until .  Itaposs not treason any moreyou injure a swan, but you could be fined up to £, - andyou kill one you could even be imprisoned for up to six months. Aside from the Queen, there are only three organisations also allowed to own swans - Abbotsbury Swannery since the th Century, and the Vintners and the Dyer since the th Century. Itaposs not just the swans that Her Majesty owns - since , she also technically claims all the sturgeons, whales, and dolphins in the waters around England and Wales, andyou catch one and want to sell it, as a gesture of loyalty you must make a request to the Queen. And the rule has been put into practice recently, too. In , a Welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a -foot sturgeon - but the Palace decreed he could keep it. Driving without a license, and travelling without a passport  Our driveraposs licenses are issued in the Queenaposs name - so doesnapost actually need one in order to drive. The Queen also doesnapost technically need a number plate on her car, either. However, she does carry a license anyway, having learnt to drive back in World War II, when she operated a first-aid truck for the Womenaposs Auxillary Territorial Service aged . She also loves surprising people with her driving abilities - taking King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, then a prince, for a spin around Balmoral in . As instructed, the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front Land Rover, with his interpreter in the seat behind. To his surprise, the Queen climbed into the driving seat, turned the ignition and drove off, wrote Former British Ambassador Sherard Cowper-Coles in the Sunday Times. Women are not - yet - allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, and Abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman, let alone a queen. Cowper-Coles added: His nervousness only increased as the Queen, an army driver in wartime, accelerated the Land Rover along the narrow Scottish estate roads, talking all the time. Through his interpreter, the crown prince implored the Queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead. And the jet-setting Queen doesnapost need to remember to pack a passport when she flies, as they are issued in her own name so she does not require one. Choosing the Poet Laureate  The Poet Laureate is an honorary position appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom, currently on the advice of the prime minister. There is an expectation that the holder will write for signicant national occasions. Currently, the role is held by Simon Armitage, who the Queen chose to succeed Carol Ann Duffy in May . The poets tend to serve for ten years before they are replaced. Signing and vetoing laws Before any bill becomes law, it must be approved by the Queen. Once a proposed law has passed both houses of Parliament, it comes to the Palace for approval - something called Royal Assent. Royal Assent is dferent to Queenaposs consent, which means the Queen must consent to any law being debated in Parliament that affects her own interests.According toin , Royal Assent has been exercised more than , times as the Queen or Prince Charles vetted laws before they were approved by parliament.They included matters ranging from justice, social security, pensions, race relations and food policy through to obscure rules on car parking charges and hovercraft. There was even one instance [in which] the Queen completely vetoed the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in , a private memberaposs bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to parliament, the publication wrote. Representatives refused to comment on how many times she had requested alterations to legislation during her reign. Creating Lords, knights, and forming the government  The Queen personally presents citizens who have made a special contribution to society with honorary titles, including damehoods and knighthoods. On the advice of elected government ministers, she can also appoint Lords who sit in parliament.Until , the Queen could also dissolve Parliament and call a general election, but now a two-thirds vote in the commons is required to do this before a five-year fixed-term is up.In a general election, she will usually appoint the MP with the majority support of voters and the House of Commons. Andthe PM resigns, the Queen will consult her advisors on who should succeed them. The Queen is also the Colonel-in-chief of the armed forces, presiding over military ceremonies and appointing new archbishops, bishops, and deans as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. She can also declare war, grant royal pardons, and requisition civilian ships for military usethe need ever arises - though this decision would be made by the PM.Not paying taxThe Queen is not legally required to pay tax, but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since . And in the unlikely event sheaposs short of cash, the Queen can pop down to the private ATM in the basement of Buckingham Palace, provided by prestigious bank Coutts. Exemption from Freedom of Information requests and prosecution  After a legal battle withover letters Prince Charles sent to Whitehall ministers, the Royal Family won the right to become exempt from Freedom of Information requests.These black spider memo documents were eventually released in  after a ten-year legal fight - but this kind of thing wonapost happen again now there is the current ruling.Not only that, the Queen is immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court. Her website explains: Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, the Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law. If the Queen did break the law, she would likely be forced to abdicate. Firing the Australian government  The Queen is the head of state in Australia, meaning she has powers over the government. Back in , her representative Government General Sir John Kerr fired Prime Minister Gough Whitlam after a government shutdown due to lack of funding in a row over the budget. It has since been described as the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australian history. Kerr appointed a replacement, Malcolm Fraser, who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government. Three hours later, Kerr dismissed the rest of Parliament and Australian citizens voted for their representatives from scratch. The Queen is also the head of state in several Commonwealth Realms or former British colonies, though itaposs mostly a ceremonial role. This includes Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu.

Face masks will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport from Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this morning.He added that he hopes the tougher rules on face coverings in England would be temporary as ministers reimpose some measures amid fears the new strain could evade existing vaccines. Boosters will be extended to younger age groups and the time between second and third jabs cut under recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation due later this week. But what is the Omicron iant  Why is it worse and how worried should we be  For answers to all those questions and more, read on...What is Omicron Omicron is the name given to the Covid iant B.... It was named by the World Health Organisation, which assigns iants of concern a Greek letter.Where did it come from It was first identied in Botswana on November  and linked to a surge in case numbers in the Gauteng province of South Africa.Why is it potentially more dangerous Omicron has  mutations on its spike protein – which allows the virus to unlock our body’s cells. It is more than double the number carried by the dominant Delta iant.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterHow worried should we be Scientists believe the iant is highly likely to be more transmissible and has features capable of evading the vaccine antibodies. But whether catching it would lead to more severe illness will not be known for weeks. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent.What is the Government doing to stop the spread Ato mask-wearing in shops and on public transport. Airport arrivals must have a PCR test and self-isolate until they are confirmed to be virus-free. Close contacts of Omicron patients must also self-isolate, and there are plans to expand the booster jab programme. When can I get my booster Over-s, health and social workers, and those with underlying health conditions are already entitled to a third jab. Rolling out the programme to under-s requires the sign-off from the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations.Can the existing vaccines be tweaked Moderna and Novavax were already beginning work to tweak their vaccines, while Pfizer and BioNTech said that – in the event of a iant arriving which evades existing jabs – they expect to be able to “develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval”.Which countries are now on the red list Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola join South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia.

Ian McPherson planned a weekend trip to Crimdon Dene Holiday Park near Hartlepool with his family for his th birthday. He travelled to the park on Friday with his we Kerry, , children Robbie, , Daniel, , Ella, seven, and their French bulldog Bella. Ian said that after they went to bed the wind was so strong that they feared for their lives and tried to go home. However they were advised not to drive during the storm and instead spent the night on the floor of the site office. The self-employed builder said: When I looked out the window I saw a caravan and it was floating down the hill on its gas bottle. It was almost like the gas bottle was its wheels. I walked towards it and looked around. At that point I decided to get in my car.  It was like something out of Mad Max. I thought it was the end of the world, thataposs what it felt like. I thought our time was up. Ian said that the strong winds started when they went to bed during their first night at the park. He said: It felt like really bad turbulence. We were all scared to go into the front part of the caravan. The fire was physically moving in the wall backwards and forwards and the caravan started bouncing. We were lying in bed thinking itaposs going to blow over. My daughter was lying in bed cuddling in to me. She was so frightened. I was saying itaposs OK but I was petried.  Ian said they attempted to leave the site after noticing the damage which was being caused to caravans around them. A number of holiday homes were ripped apart during the night and a member of the security team was taken to hospital. Ian said he went to the site office with his family during the early hours of the morning. He said a member of staff advised against him driving back to their home in Chester-le-Street, County Durham. The dad-of-three said: We went to the site office and we sat on one of the office floors. We went up to the site office at about half past four in the morning and stopped there until eight oaposclock.  Ian said that he was then told to collect his belongings from his caravan on Saturday morning and evacuate the site. The trip, which was supposed to last until Monday, had been his first visit to Crimdon Dene. Ian said they planned to watch the Newcastle United match and go into Hartlepool for an Indian meal. We were all there as a family. We never do anything as a family, even the dog was there! Ian said it was simply pot luck that the caravan they were staying is did not suffer serious damage like others on the site and added: It was horrendous.  It was a shock to see caravans overturned. I just feel so lucky that wasnapost us. A spokesperson for Crimdon Dene Holiday Park said yesterday: A number of caravans have been damaged as a result of Storm Arwen, and we are in touch with any owners affected. One member of our security team on park has been taken to hospital as a precaution after injuring his knee, and we are making sure he has whatever support he needs.The park is currently closed, and due to the dangerous weather causing a threat to le, everybody should adhere to Met Office guidance and stay away from the park for the time being.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Met OfficeStorms\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple stepped down as senior royals at the beginning of  and have since carved out a le for themselves and their children Archie and Lilibet in Calornia, after leaving the UK.And now royal biographer Andrew Morton, who has penned the unauthorised book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, says that the couple felt they didnapost get the support they wanted from the Firm.Speaking to the Express, Mr Morton, who famously wrote Diana: In Her Own Words, said: They are popular and what they found dficult to accept was that inside the Royal Family itaposs not about popularity, itaposs about the position. Harry was lower down the totem pole, and so too was Meghan. They didnapost get the funding they wanted, they felt they didnapost get the support they wanted.Mr Morton likened their situation to the Queenaposs late sister Princess Margaret and her husband Lord Snowdon, who he says were incredibly popular in the Swinging Sixties but lower down the totem pole.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Paul Cowie, , had previously battled an -hour operation to remove tumours from his brain, and after an IVF battle with we Carla the pair were expecting their first child - son Carter. But just a month before their miracle baby was born, Paul was told that his cancer was ed and was terminal. While battling the cancer, Paul and Carla welcomed their little boy, but just eight months later on November , , Paul died. Carter is now two, and Carla has been doing her best to raise the little boy knowing who is dad is and what an incredible man he was.  Although he doesnapost have any memories of the dad who loved him so much, Carter calls out for him in his sleepShe told the Liverpool Echo : Itaposs absolutely heartbreaking. Some days, I feel like I donapost have time to breath, because my little boy, heaposs two. Heaposs a toddler now.Itaposs just horrendous. He was my soulmate. He was my everything. And the struggle of living without him, itaposs just heartwrenching to think that cancer could take a young le that quick. The couple got to do what theyaposd been waiting for all their lives when they married on August  at the Village Hotel in Whiston. Theyaposd booked the wedding the day they registered Carteraposs birth, to make sure it happened in time. Speaking of their special day she said: It was a lovely day. Itaposd been raining all that week, and that particular day, the sun was shining. We had a very lovely reception. They went to Turkey after the wedding, but three days later, he couldnapost walk. She added There was a tumour on his spine. He had spinal cord compressions off a tumour on his spine. So he was bed bound from there on. Carla said: I was absolutely destroyed. Absolutely destroyed.  Because he was a keen football player, and to see him like that - he didnapost really want to be like that. He just wanted to walk. He just wanted to get better, for his son. But unfortunately, the cancer took over him. But Carla wants Paul to be remembered for more than the cancer. She said: I donapost want him to be remembered as the lad who died of cancer. I want him to be remembered as Paul and the lad who would do anything for anyone. He was a remarkable dad. He leaves behind his mum, his little brother, his dad, his nan. We all loved him. Itaposs not really the best time of year as well. Itaposs coming up towards Christmas, and heaposs going to miss Carteraposs milestones. All he wanted to do was see his son grow. Carla struggles to get out of bed some mornings, but she keeps going, driven by a desire to be there for Carter and keep Paulaposs memory alive. In a way, Paulaposs memory lives in Carter. His mum: have a picture of Carter at Paulaposs age. He looks exactly the same as him. Heaposs got Paulaposs witty and funny ways. He laughs at anything. Heaposs just Paul in every way. I feel like Iaposve got a piece of Paul growing up with me. Carter knows his dad isnapost around anymore, but at two years old, heaposs still too young to fully understand why. Weaposve got pictures all around the house and he says, aposThereaposs my daddy!apos, and he shouts out aposdaddyapos in his sleep, she said. I think, as he gets older, Iaposll explain to Carter that that is his daddy and he didnapost really want to leave him. She also hopes sheaposll take Carter to see the world like his father Paul did in his  years on this earth, travelling with his mum and nan, and visiting Canada and the US across the Atlantic. Carla wants Carter to see places that Paulaposs seen. She hopes other families wonapost have to suffer this tragedy like they have, and she encourages people to push for tests and scansthey feel something is wrong. Paulaposs symptoms were originally dismissed as a normal headache before scans revealed a cancerous growth. Carla said : I just want to raise awareness of people whoaposve got tumour symptoms and what to look out for, and to really know their own body, becausesomething doesnapost feel right, it usually isnapost right.

I just think they should have organised some sort of accommodation.” Alissia said her power supply went off shortly before midnight on Friday night and claims she was told by SP Energy Networks that power would be back by Saturday. However, as of Sunday night, Alissia and her family are still stuck without electricity or gas. “All I want is for the kids to be warm, she said. “I’m not happy because he [seven-week-old son Kaleb] is basically a newborn baby and obviously there are other families with young babies, and it’s not fair on them. She added: “I’ve had to put him in his coat and things like that, and we haven’t been able to sterilise his bottles properly.”  Another problem is the fact that the family’s fridge is currently without power, meaning that their food has spoiled. Alissia said: “All of our stuff in our freezer has defrosted. I havenapost long done a big shop for the run up to Christmas, all my frozen food has defrosted and is now unsafe to eat, some things in my fridge have also gone off.Alissia said she was told by SP Energy Networks that they were prioritising other groups.“Obviously I understand the situation and it can’t be helped because it is weather related, but I do think they [SP Energy Networks] should help to do more for families, especially ones with young children,” she said.On their Twitter account on Sunday, SP Energy Networks said: “Against these conditions, we’re committed to getting customers without power back on as quickly and safely as we can.“Since the beginning of the storm weaposve reconnected over , customers. In Scotland , customers are currently affected and in England and Wales , customers are currently affected. “Over the last few days, we’ve received an unprecedented volume of contacts from customers by both phone and social media, so we’d encourage you to check our website for updates where you can in the first instance. “Importantly,you or someone in your home is vulnerable, or in need of extra support, please make sure you call us on  to discuss support we can give you. It might take longer to answer your call, but our teams are here   to speak to as many customers as possible.” Punters, staff and members of a tribute act have been left trapped inside a pub in the Yorkshire Dales after several feet of snowfall caused by Storm Arwen. has left them unable to escape. Customers had driven to the remote Tan Hill Inn to enjoy a performance from Oasis tribute aposNoasisapos, but were left with no choice but to stay when the storm engulfed their cars in snow. They have now spent a third night in Britainaposs highest boozer.

We all have our methods -with some chefs swearing by goose fat, while others simply use olive oil.Now Nigella has shared her view, Leicestershire Live reports.The national treasure says people can transform their potatoes into golden delicious nuggets with just a few ingredients - salt and pepper, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here And she steams them for about  minutes before they get put in the oven to ensure they have an earth-shattering crunch.“While steaming then roasting potatoes may seem rather a fandango, one bite of these will convince you that itaposs utterly worth it besides, itaposs not asyou have to do anything while they either steam or roast,” she wrote on Instagram.“Go slowly when adding the salt and vinegar, tasting as you go, as I like these to have the wincing hit of salt and vinegar crisps, and you may prefer a lighter hand with the sprinkling.” They were met with a note of approval on social media, as one fan raved: This is the KEY to ensuring your spuds are perfectly fluffy.

Linda Elsworth, , is one of several tenants on Wordsworth Drive in Oulton, near Leeds, who have been issued eviction notices that require them to be out of their homes by December . But the deadline is now imminent, and Linda says she has nowhere to gosheaposs evicted next week - and evenshe did aposit wouldnapost be the sameapos.Linda, originally from Hornsea, told LeedsLive : I paid for this out of my own pocket and made the place my home and my community. I was comfortable in thinking this would be my forever home, and now the rugaposs been pulled from under us and itaposs not.Itaposs a little bit disheartening because I spent most of my savings to make this my home and now itaposs all going to be taken away from me.  Itaposs devastating. Itaposs like losing your family. The thought of being homeless is scary - especially at this time of year. The eviction notice comes from landlord Pemberstone - who have been planning to redevelop the estate since , and have now got the ball rolling with eviction notices to the eight most aposstructurally unsoundapos houses on the estate. Linda, a retired administrator, moved to the Sugar Hill estate comprising Wordsworth Drive and Sugar Hill Close, six and a half years ago after her marriage broke down. Her house is decked out in her two favourite things, which she calls aposobsessionsapos, owls and the colour purple - collections sheaposs built up to make the place her own. Linda said: Iaposm having to pack up all my boxes, with all my memories. Iaposve got to decide which bits to get rid of - because there wonapost be room for them wherever I go.  After several years of the estate fighting Pemberstoneaposs application to bulldoze the old mining estate - Linda and some of her neighbours received notice in August they would need to be out by December . I only have about four or five days - but thereaposs no way thataposs going to happen because Iaposve got nowhere to go, she said. Iaposm physically looking for places but there just isnapost anywhere - at least not anywhere that I could afford. The reason we all live here is because theyaposre affordable properties for people such as myself on a state pension and housing benefits and people on lower income.Iaposm extremely worried. My hairaposs started to fall out and my blood pressure is up and down all over the place. Iaposm not the healthiest person at the moment anyway. Itaposs not helping - the fact that Iaposve got to try and pack and move stuff around.I donapost know what to do. When Wednesday comes around and Iaposm going to have to say aposaposIaposm sorry Iaposm not moving because Iaposve got nowhere to goapos. When I moved here I was a lot healthier and able to do it, but now my health has deteriorated and my mobilityaposs gone and I need walking aids. I can manage keeping the house neat and tidy but having to pull it apart and move furniture and pack is just hard work. Lindaaposs next door neighbour has already moved out ahead of the eviction notice, and she says sheaposs felt aposa bit lostapos since they went. Leeds City Council originally denied Pemberstone planning permission to bulldoze the estate in  - but the decision was overturned the next year by the government.  The estate, campaigning as group Save Our Homes LS, urged the council to buy the estate and refurbish the houses, but they concluded it would be too expensive. A spokesperson from Leeds City Council said: The notices being served to residents of Sugar Hill Close and Wordsworth Drive in Oulton are from landlord Pemberstone, in accordance with national law. In terms of council support for the residents, Leeds Housing Options has contacted them with advice and assistance, and a surgery also took place in the community last week, both during the day and in the evening. A spokesman for Pemberstone added: An extensive survey of all  houses in  found that there was signicant structural damage and deterioration to  properties which threatens their overall structural stability. A follow-up survey in March this year found that they have continued to deteriorate. We, therefore, had to take the dficult decision to give notice to eight tenants who are on standard tenancy agreements. Of these, five are currently still in occupation. For the tenants who have to move, we have provided a four months’ notice period and have offered an ex-gratia payment equivalent to up to six months’ rent to help with relocation costs.

The video has emerged today and shows the group repeating the same line over and over again. Piers seems to be so enthusiastic about the embarrassing chant that he waves his arms at one point as though conducting. He is then seen ripping a sticker from the window which encourages passengers to wear masks.  After a while, the group begin chanting resist, defy, do not comply. Many have tweeted ridiculing the chat, which comes as the PM tightens rules on mask wearing on public transport. Jeremy Vine tweeted: This apossongapos only has one line, but Piers Corbyn keeps forgetting it.  Another commented: Grown adults. Well done really responsible. I know letaposs sing a little ditty in protest. Jesus wept no wonder we are where we are. Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that face coverings would once again be mandatory in shops and on public transport after the emergence of the new Omicron Covid iant.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said the Governmentaposs decision to impose tighter restrictions on face masks is welcome.He tweeted: Todayaposs announcement that face coverings will be compulsory on public transport nationwide, as they already are across TfL, is welcome. Evidence shows they help stop the virus spreading, and this is a measure Iaposve repeatedly urged the Government to take.

The couple made headlines across the world in March when they suggested a senior member of the royal family asked what colour Archieaposs skin would be. Brothers And Wives: Inside The Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan, a book by author Christopher Andersen, has now claimed Charles, , was the royal. A spokesperson for the Prince of Wales has strongly denied the claims, stating: “This is fiction and not worth further comment.” The book claims Charles questioned what his grandchildaposs complexion might look like during a conversation with we Camilla over breakfast. The alleged discussion supposedly took place on the morning Harry and Meghanaposs engagement was officially announced, November , , the book states.  A source told the royal author that Charles allegedly said to Camilla: I wonder what the children will look like. The book claims she was somewhat taken aback by the comment, and responded: Well, absolutely gorgeous, Iaposm certain. The insider also claimed Charles then lowered his voice and asked: I mean, what do you think their childrenaposs complexion might be  Andersen wrote that “scheming courtiers” then gave Charles’ alleged words “a racist spin”. A Page Six report claimed the alleged conversation then “reached toxic proportions” by the time Harry and Meghan were informed.Charles, according to The Sun, is calling in the lawyers over the claims in the book. An insider told The Sun: “The claims are utterly ridiculous. “There is more of a concern that commenting on it will simply sell more books than actually damage Charles’ reputation.” Buckingham Palace said last night: “We don’t comment on books of this kind as to do so risks giving it some form of authority or credibility.” After the interview with Oprah in March, Harry agreed and said he would never share the full details of the discussion. Oprah later revealed it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment, telling CBS This Morning: He did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, andI had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations.

The first instalment of The Princes and The Press has angered the royal households over ‘overblown and unfounded’ claims.It accused the royal households of actively briefing against Harry and Meghan so lawyers will carefully watching the second part on Monday.If they decide the corporation has breached rules on accuracy and impartiality in addition to not giving them a fair right of reply they may take action, Mail on Sunday reports. Harry has complained online that the term ‘Megxit’ – which is used to describe the Sussexes’ controversial decision to quit the Royal family – was sexist and the BBC has instead swapped the phrase for ‘Sussexitapos. The dad-of-two sad online: The term Megxit was or is a misogynistic term, and it was created by a troll, amplied by royal correspondents, and it grew and grew into mainstream media. Royal aides are also claimed to be furious over allegations made by ‘pro-Sussex’ journalists in the programme. They said the BBC failed to offer a proper right of reply against the claims. One of the journalists includes Omid Scobie who said that ‘negative stories’ had been leaked about Meghan Markle to ‘put her in her place’.The co-author of Finding Freedom - a biography about the Sussexes - said: There’s been rumours that a lot of the most damaging and negative stories... have come from other royal households or royal aides. From my research and reporting that’s true. Mr Scobie made the allegation without providing any credible evidence nor was his claims challenged by the documentaryaposs presenter Amol Rajan.  Meghanaposs lawyer Jenny Afia also featured in the documentary to give counter reports that she was ‘dficult’ to work with - with the Duchessapos permission. Ms Afiaaposs statement was not challenged in the programme despite Buckingham Palace launching an internal investigation into claims that Meghan had bullied staff. The second instalment is expected to cause more upset as it includes suggestions that senior royals - including William - ‘planted’ stories about Harry’s mental health. William, who has campaigned on mental health, is claimed to be upset at the suggestion. It was Harry who first raised the subject of his mental health during a television interview in  when he revealed he had had experienced a resurgence of mental health issues that needed ‘constant management’. After William watched the interview he reportedly was said to be aposconcerned about his brother’s wellbeing.  Sources have suggested any claims about Harry’s mental health were ‘planted’ are ‘categorically untrue’. Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace – the three royal households - are claimed to be in ‘lockstep’ over their reaction to the documentary. The Mail reports that a final decision onthey will take any action will be made after the second instalment is aired. If they do it could either be a complaint to the BBC governors or to watchdog Ofcom. Legal action is an option but it is thought to be unlikely. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have banned the BBC from showing their Christmas carol concert amid anger over the documentary, it has been claimed.The charity fundraiser, which is reportedly set to be hosted by the Duchess of Cambridge herself at Westminster Abbey, will be broadcast by rival ITV instead. Sources say forthcoming royal projects such as the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee are unlikely to be affected but William may rethink any future collaborations. In a joint statement shown at the end of the first documentary, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace and Clarence House said: “A free, responsible and open Press is of vital importance to healthy democracy. “However, too often overblown and unfounded claims from unknown sources are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince HarryKensington PalaceBBCBuckingham PalaceDocumentariesRoyal FamilyMental healthBullying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But it was a dferent story for the owners of these dogs, who had a blast running around in the snow as it came down across the UK.The wholesome clips of the pups enjoying the winter weather were shared across Twitter - fromCilla the Labradoodlehaving a thorough roll in the snow in the East Midlands, toblack Lab Winstonbounding off down the icy road for a snow-fuelled adventure in Moray, Scotland.In Sheffield, it was poodle bichon frise cross Arthur’s first time seeing snow - and after an initial cursory snf the pup seemed to thoroughly approve, as the cute clip filmed by ownerAlexisshows him leaping through the snow and looking up at the sky in disbelief. Elsewhere in Sheffield,Ben the border colliedidn’t let a bit of weather deter him from his usual activities, as a clip shows him digging out a huge stick from the snow and proudly carrying it away. Aptly-named poodle Penguin seemed to have endless energy reserves in the East Midlands, as a video posted by his ownerTeresashows the hyper dog racing around in the fresh snowfall. While up in ScotlandLabradors Albert and Berasaw the dusting of white as more of a tasty snack than a playground, seen eagerly snaffling up snowballs that their owner tosses them.It wasn’t just this side of the pond that saw the weather turn over the weekend - dogs across the world were united in their love of snow.Golden retriever Gracieenjoyed a chilly roll in the snow in Ontario, Canada, and chihuahuas Niko and Milo were filmed by their ownerCheyanneenjoying their first ever snowfall in Toronto. Golden retriever Lloydmay win the prize for the most enthusiasm though - seeing the snow over in Michigan, US, sent the pup spinning in excited circles.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsSnowAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Necessary precautions have been taken to prevent further spread, the council said. The case is said to be well and isolating with family. Though they have some symptoms, they do not require hospitalisation. Essex County Council said in a series of tweets: Following further contact tracing of the known Omicron Covid- case in Brentwood, it has been confirmed that there is a link to Larchwood Primary School based in Pilgrims Hatch.  UK Health and Security Agency, Department of Health and Social Care, Larchwood Primary School and colleagues from Essex County Council and Brentwood Council have worked together to take necessary precautionary action to prevent the spread. This includes making specialist testing available for all pupils and school staff and confirming arrangements for remote learning for one class. We appreciate that this is an unsettling time for parents, pupils and the school community but we take the time to remind everyone that this is a precautionary measure.  A person infected with the Omicron iant in Essex is well and isolating with their family, the regionaposs top public health official has said.Essex director of public health Dr Michael Gogarty told BBC Breakfast: Most importantly with the confirmed case is that they are well, they are isolating with their family.When I say that they are well, I mean they are not seriously ill. They have some symptoms but they do not require hospitalisation.  Students at the school are being tested for the new Omicron iant, the regionaposs top public health official said. Dr Gogarty said: What weaposre doing is weaposre throwing the net very wide in terms of requesting people who attended these places at the particular times to get tested as soon as possible. Within the school we are actually excluding one school group as close contacts, but with the rest of the school group we would wish them to get tested and we are arranging for that testing to happen. Some sought it yesterday, and the rest will happen today. A number of sites in Essex visited by a person infected with the Omicron iant are being targeted for testing, Mr Gogarty added. There are a number of sites we are looking at where these people had contact . One you would be aware of is the KFC in Brentwood. Thereaposs also a face setting and a school setting.

The Met Office has also issued two yellow ice warnings - one across eastern parts of Scotland and another stretching from the north-east of England down to the south coast - from Sunday afternoon until later this morning.The warnings say people should expect to see icy patches on roads and pavements, meaning accidents and slips and falls are more likely. On Sunday drivers in County Durham who ignored aposroad closedapos signs found themselves stranded in the snow. Many parts of the country fell below freezing to around minus C minus Covernight, with Shap in Cumbria hitting minus .C .  It comes after Storm Arwen wreaked havoc across much of the UK, bringing strong winds, sleet and snow. Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan told the PA news agency on Sunday: As Storm Arwen is clearing out to Europe, a cold northerly flow of wind has been left behind in the UK, causing some of the bitterly cold temperatures weaposve seen. There is set to be further wintry weather, with snow expected to fall across areas in Scotland and northern England, and even in parts of southern and central England.Parts of Scotland and northern England, where snow is on the ground, will be very cold again, with the temperature certainly falling below zero and even as low as minus C . Evenyou do live in a city, you can expect to be scraping frost, ice or even snow off your cars on Monday morning. Mr Morgan added that, although frost will also be seen in Wales and Northern Ireland, temperatures there will not fall as low as England and Scotland. A cold weather alert was issued by the UK Health Security Agency on Friday, remaining in place until Monday, prompting advice to people to try to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of the chilly conditions such as the elderly and anyone with heart and lung problems. Mr Morgan said this is due to an Arctic shot which has moved south across the UK. The cold spell comes after three people were killed when trees were blown over by strong winds as Storm Arwen hit on Friday. Gusts of almost mph also caused transport disruption, power cuts and damage to buildings, while heavy snow led to lorries getting stuck and ploughs being used in a number of areas. The Energy Networks Association, the industry body for UK power suppliers, said , homes were still without power as of pm on Sunday but , had seen supplies restored. The organisation said the damage has been three times greater than that experienced during the Beast From The East storm in , and the worst storm to affect power supplies in  years. A spokesperson said: Our members are working with local resilience partners, the British Red Cross and emergency services to provide extra help and support. Welfare centres have also been set up and dedicated teams are contacting vulnerable customers.  Northern Powergrid, which supplies energy to the North East, Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire, had said , of its customers lost service but on Sunday announced supply had been restored to ,. The company added more than , instances of damage have been recorded, with more being discovered as repairs continue. Electricity North West, which provides energy for an area between the Scottish border and Stockport, said , of , customers who lost power had seen their supply restored by am on Sunday. SP Energy Networks, a supplier for parts of Scotland, England and Wales, said , customers had been reconnected but , are still affected - mainly in the Borders, Dumfriesshire, Fe, Lothian, Dee Valley, Oswestry, Mid Wales, and North Wales. Western Power Distribution, which supplies energy to the Midlands, parts of Wales and the South West, said it had , customers without power as of .pm on Sunday.

Heres everything you need to know about the new strainFace masks in shops and on public transport are once again required Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments A new strain of the coronavirus is causing concern - but how is it dferent to what we have seen before Doctors and scientists are working to learn more about the Omicron iant, which was first identied in South Africa.In response to the discovery of the new iant, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the reintroduction of some restrictions in public.People are now required to wear masks in shops and on public transport.Contacts of those with the Omicron iant are also being required to isolate for  days.PCR tests are effective in identying the strain and there is an expected announcement that the booster jab will become available to all UK adults.As well as this, any person arriving in the UK must take a PCR test on their second day and isolate until they have a negative result.Officials said this morning that six new cases were confirmed in Scotland and the UK announced its first three cases of the new mutant virus strain over the weekend.So what is the Omicron iant   What is the Omicron Covid- iant  Omicron is a mutated strain of the coronavirus. It is feared that compared to other strains, Omicron is more resistant to vaccines and more easily transmitted, but this has not been confirmed. Viruses are adaptable and this means that they develop over time due to genetic mutations also known as aposcopying errorsapos. Our immune systems are trained to recognise certain viruses and will produce antibodies in order to fight against them. Vaccines help to build up antibodies to protect us from specic viruses.  Mutations look slightly dferent to our antibodies and the part they use to attack other cells can change. This makes mutations harder for our antibodies to fight. The Omicron iant is shaped dferently to previous strains, making it dficult for our immune system to attack. It is reported that the general symptoms of the Omicron iant generally affect people with slightly dferent symptoms than the Delta iant.  How is Omicron dferent to the Delta iant  A doctor in South Africa explained that the Omicron clinical picture doesnapost fit Delta. Chair of the South African Medical Association Dr Angelique Coetzee, told AFP: We have seen a lot of Delta patients during the third wave. And this [Omicron] doesnapost fit in the clinical picture. Most of them are seeing very, very mild symptoms and none of them so far have admitted patients to surgeries. She said that symptoms of Omicron may be more likely to be extreme tiredness, a scratchy throat and mild muscle ache. As another general expectation, people are more unlikely to experience a loss of taste or smell.  What does Omicron mean  Like other iants, Omicron has been named by the World Health Organisation after a letter in the Greek alphabet. The first  letters of the alphabet have already been used to name dferent strains, which is why names such as aposAlphaapos, aposGammaapos and aposDeltaapos may sound familiar. Other iants have not been known to be as strong or effective, so are less famous.  The next letter, after the aposMu iantapos, was expected to be named after the letter aposNuapos. However, Nu and the following letter aposXiapos were skipped and the new iant is named after the next letter, aposOmicronapos. It has been reported that this was done to avoid confusion and for political reasons. Nu may have sounded like aposnew iantapos, which could have been confusing for people and Xi was avoided due to President Xi Jinping, current leader of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.

That’s what happened to one woman on Reddit, who said she had been allowing her neighbours to use her driveway for their cars because she doesn’t own a vehicle herself so had no use for the space. And while things had been going well for a while, she became annoyed with her neighbours after they refused to move one of their cars to make space for a taxi that was bringing her brother home from the hospital. She explained: “I don’t have a car and the house I bought a couple years ago came with a drive large enough for two cars.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “My next-door neighbours have always been allowed to use my drive because I didn’t need it. It really didn’t bother me becauseI had friends over then I’d just ask them to move, and they would. “I currently live with my -year-old brother who has very weak joints and has to go to hospital every month or so on average. A couple of months ago he tore the one in his knee and had to be on crutches. “We were pulling into our street in the taxi after leaving hospital and one of my neighbours pulled into my drive, blocking our taxi from pulling up to the door. “We waited for them to realise my brother had crutches and move but she looked at us and carried on inside, along with her sisters and stepdad. I had to hobble my brother across wet muddy grass to get to our door.”  The woman said she was left so incensed by her neighbour’s actions that she took back her offer to let them use her driveway. But now, several members of the household have welcomed children and have started parking in her drive again, so they don’t have to walk to their house with their baby carriers. And when the woman tried to confront them, she was slammed as “heartless” for being rude to a new mother. She wrote: “I was so angry I then told my neighbours that they were no longer allowed to use my drive. They protested, saying they had three cars and a van and had nowhere to park. I sympathised but still said no. My own brother couldn’t use his drive when he couldn’t even walk thanks to their nastiness.  “In the past three months, three of the residents’ children have had babies and have started parking on my drive again. I know why. Because they’d have to walk two blocks otherwise with baby carriers. “One of these girls confronted me, telling me that I don’t even need the drive and that it’s heartless to do that to a new mother. Her sister backed her up. “I replied that it was also heartless to make my brother walk across dangerous grass when he was on crutches and in agony.” The woman then said she knows her actions are “petty”, but she doesn’t want to budge because they were cruel to her brother. She added: “I was neighbourly until they caused me not to be. I know I am being petty and vindictive in my reasoning, but I feel I am justied as I did them a courtesy for years by letting them use my drive only for them to treat my brother so cruelly.” And commenters on Reddit agreed with the woman, insisting she can use her driveway however she likes. One person said: “What idiots! They had a good thing going, much better than they deserved, and messed it up just through thoughtlessness.” While another added: “They’re mad they don’t get to take advantage anymore. Don’t let up, and good for you for making sure your brother can get inside easily.” What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.

Nowadays there are all sorts of apps to contend with, and tips and tricks to find a partner. Tinder is the place people usually turn to when desperate and in need of some sort of affection. You get the app on your phone, you make an account, you add some pictures , you try and come up with the quirkiest bio and then - boom - profile done.You start swiping, left for no, right for yes. Then comes the messaging, either you or the other person starts with a Hello, and you go from there.Now the scary part is actually setting up a date. After a couple of days of exchanging messages, you’re going to want to meet this ‘prince charming’. Or at least that’s what I thought.  It was around March this year when, after a bad break up, I decided to jump back on the dating wagon. After a couple of weeks of just ‘window shopping’ and being too scared to commit to any of the plans I was making with all these guys, I started talking with the man I thought was going to be ‘the one’. Beautul blue eyes, nice curly brown hair, his bio said ft tall. Honestly, every heterosexual girl’s dream. So, I took my chances. I messaged him first, something girls don’t tend to do very often. Our conversation started like any other we talked for hours and got to know each other, so we moved the conversation on to Snapchat. A couple of days went by, we kept messaging each other and worked out that we had more things in common than we first thought. And so we set up a date.  The original plan was to meet up by the pier, go watch the sunset, and then get some food at a restaurant near there. When the big day came, I put on a nice outfit, applied my makeup, grabbed my bag and was on my way. I met up with him by the pier, but instead of us going to the beach like weaposd originally agreed, he said he had a better place in mind. We took a left and strolled to some small hills, with the forlorn view of some excavators and barren rocks.  We sat down on a bench and started talking. From the start the conversation was weird - he started telling me about his Satanist flatmate from uni. It was a very weird curveball as that wasn’t related to the original topic. Then all of a sudden, he started throwing all these insults at me, about how I am an ‘idiot’ and a bit too ‘chubby’ for him. All of this while he gradually closed the gap between us on the bench. When he told me he didn’t like girls who smoke, I saw that as my silver lining.  I lit one cigarette and he seemed to back off, but just when I finished, he grabbed my shoulders and forced my face close to his. In that moment I knew that the only thing left for me to do is to message my friends. Luckily one of them called me immediately with our code - her boyfriend had broken up with her and I needed to head back ASAP. I told him so and went to leave. After an awkward goodbye, and me getting home, he saw my Snap Maps was on and asked to pick me up to go out with him and his friends. That’s when I blocked him. Moral of the story: online dating is scary, and for me this could have easily taken a turn for the worst. Itaposs made me more hesitant about who I put my trust in for future dates.

The palace is located next to Konstantinovsky Palace, President Putin’s seaside residence and was owned by Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich, the son of Russian Emperor, Nicholas the First. Dmitry, , documented his trip, photographing the desolate property. In one image, a large room with a scratched high ceiling is pictured as light beams through the three archways in the centre of the room. In another, a staircase drops down onto a lower floor that has red and black etchings across the wall.  Above the staircase are two sculptures, along with a piece of artwork that shows a screaming skull. Other shots show the foot of a broken statue leaning against a pole, while other angles show the remains of the broken statue. As the palace is still protected by private security, Dmitry had to sneak past security guards to gain access. Luckily for him, he didn’t meet a single guard – but the building itself still remains dficult to access due to construction restrictions.  “All the doors and windows of the palace were boarded up, so it was dficult to find the entrance,” Dmitry said. “I went during the day, because I wanted to take good photos. Several caryatid sculptures have been preserved outside, and inside you can see the broken plaster statues of lions that are used to guard the main entrance. “The original mouldings on the walls and ceiling have also been preserved, but in general, the interior is completely destroyed.  “From the roof, you can see the Government highway for Saint-Petersburg, as well as the Gulf of Finland far on the horizon. “It was easy for me to imagine how great balls and high-society receptions took place in this palace and even how there was a rest house for Soviet working people here. “Decay, rust and a thick layer of dust from construction debris, as well as scraps of electrical wiring, broken tiles and broken interior doors and windows remain. “[On another wall] is etched: ‘For those who are afraid, there is no entrance.’ “[The palace] is not well-known or in a secret location – just located too far from the centre of the city, so there are no tourists, only a few locals who visit.  “Of course there were concerns [about being caught] but it is unlikely that I would have been shot or put in jail. They could have kept me with the police for several hours or fined me.” In , two buildings based on the palace grounds of Mikhailovskaya Dacha were bought and allocated for Grand Duke Mikhail, before being torn down in . Nicholas the First instructed an architect to design a new palace, which was finished in  – but it was ruined during World War  along with many other buildings. In , the estate was given to Kirovsky Plant and was partially restored in the s as a recreation centre, but closed its doors in the s  Dmitry said: “In the s, when Russia lost in the Cold War, the country was in complete ruin and the economy was in decline. “There was no money in the budget and not only were architectural monuments destroyed, but also factories and enterprises. “Small restoration was carried out, which is noticeable on the roof – but as always, money ran out or perhaps it was stolen. The building now stands completely destroyed and abandoned.” In July , the palace grounds were given to St. Petersburg State University, as a place to put their graduate school of management. However, this restoration hasn’t yet been completed and the building still stands abandoned.

Dr Coetzee told the AFP that she alerted health officials of a clinical picture that doesnapost fit Delta on  November when seven patients showed dferent symptoms that seemed very much related to normal viral infection. What is Omicron   The Omicron strain, or B..., is a super mutant iant which has  genetic mutations, over  of them being spike protein mutations. With traits seen in previous iants as well as three new changes that have never been seen before, scientists have expressed worry over Omicronaposs transmissibility and ability to evade immunity from vaccines and previous infections. What are the symptoms of Omicron Dr Coetzee told the BBC that the symptoms of Omicron are mild.She said her patients presented with extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, scratchy throat and dry cough. Unlike the previous iants, this one doesnapost cause loss of taste or smell, she added.  The World Health Organisationsaid that initially reported infections were among university students exhibiting mild illness, adding that the severity of the iant won’t be clear until days or even weeks from now. How is it dferent to the Delta iant   Compared to the Delta iant, Dr Coetzee has said the symptoms are very, very mild, with no patients being admitted to surgeries over infections so far. She highlighted that most patients with Omicron could be treated at home. Though cases are not severe yet, Dr Coetzee warned: What we have to worry about is older, unvaccinated people. If they are not vaccinated, we are going to see many people with a severe form of the disease. What to doyou have symptoms of Covid-  Anyone with any symptoms of Covid need to stay at home and self-isolate immediately.Arrange a PCR test as soon as possible, whether or not youaposve received one or two doses of the vaccine.

The dramatic footage was captured in Norwayaposs Svalbard archipelago in August - in the summertime when the sea ice retreats along with the seals, which are the polar bearaposs main source of food.A research team from a nearby Polish scientic station captured on video a young female polar bear hunting a male reindeer by chasing it into the water, catching and drowning it before eating it , France reports. Izabela Kulaszewicz, a biologist at the University of Gdansk, witnessed the astonishing scene and found it so unusual that she co-wrote Polar Biology with two other researchers. The researchers argued that what they saw suggests polar bears are increasingly preying on land animals to make up for their limited access to seals.They also say there are indications the predator has been hunting reindeer more often in recent decades. The authors say it comes down to two factors: the retreating sea ice is keeping polar bears on land for longer periods and the reindeer population on Svalbard has been increasing since the  hunting ban.  They suggest that eating reindeer has been a matter of necessity and opportunity. Svalbard, which is just over , kilometres from the North Pole, has some  sedentary bears living alongside , reindeer. Other experts have cautioned looking into what happened too much. Andrew Derocher, a professor at the University of Alberta said: If polar bears were killing reindeer back in the s and s, it would have been very rare to have been seen, as there were few people, few bears, and few reindeer.  Now, with modern media, everyone has a camera, social media and the aposnewsapos spreads fast. Polar bears typically eat seals but have also even been known to eat eggs, birds, rodents and dolphins. Reindeer would be a good source of food during the summer period, which now lasts longer because of global warming, experts say. Two days after the Polish researchers filmed their video, the same polar bear was seen eating another reindeer carcass. Norwegian expert Jon Aars, a co-author of the article, said: Reindeer can be important, at least for some polar bears when they have to stay on land for extended periods.

Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

Those aged  and over are already eligible for a booster vaccine.Booster doses should be given no sooner than three months after people have had their second dose of an original vaccine ndash shaving three months off the current six-month wait, according to the JCVI.In further advice, young people aged  to  should be offered a second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine, no sooner than  weeks after their first dose.The JCVI also said that severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a booster dose no sooner than three months after completing their primary course of three doses.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons he accepted the JCVI advice in full, adding: ldquoWith this new iant on the offensive these measures will protect more people more quickly and make us better protected as a nation.ldquoIt represents a huge step up for our vaccination programme, almost doubling the number of people who will be able to get a booster dose to protect themselves and their loved ones.Englandrsquos deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told a Downing Street briefing that coronavirus iants were inevitable and Omicron was the ldquonew kid on the block for now but suggested the UK was in ldquouncharted territory as to whether it would take hold.He added: ldquoI think itrsquos true to say that scientists around the world, not just in the UK, unfortunately agree that this one is of increased concern..removeHe said the ldquonumber of mutations present, already on first principle, makes us worry about a possible effect on vaccine effectiveness.Urging people not to panic, Prof Van-Tam said there were still uncertainties about how transmissible the iant is and its impact on severity of disease.ldquoOn the effects of the new iants, and how well vaccine effectiveness will hold up, here I want to be clear that this is not all doom and gloom at this stage, he said.ldquoI do not want people to panic at this stage. If vaccine effectiveness is reduced, as seems pretty likely to some extent, the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects on preventing severe disease.Prof Van-Tam said the booster campaign has ldquonever been more vital than at this point in time.He compared the situation to a football team with key players on a yellow card, saying that everyone needed to ldquoup their game in response.ldquoWe started with  players in the team with the Wuhan vaccine. You could say that we picked up a couple of injuries when Alpha came along and then Delta came along, those iants that are slightly dferent from the Wuhan original strain.ldquoWersquove had to use our subs off the bench to keep us in the game, but we are well in the game ndash you can see that with the current epidemiology in relation to Delta, that the vaccines are holding up very well and largely keeping us out of trouble.ldquoOmicron is like now picking up a couple of yellow cards to key players on top.ldquoWe may be OK but wersquore kind of starting to feel at risk that we might go down to  players andthat happens ndash or itrsquos a risk thatrsquos going to happen ndash then we need everyone on the pitch to up their game in the meantime.He added: ldquoWersquore not going to wait for the red card to happen, we are going to act decisively now and wersquore asking everyone to up their game, wersquore asking everyone to play their part in the urgency now of the booster programme, coming forward the moment you are called by the NHS.Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI told the briefing there was an increased likelihood of a ldquomismatch between current vaccines and the iant, which may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"But he said a boost of either Moderna or Pfizer could really push up the immune response and cutting the time between doses could mitigate any drop in vaccine protection.ldquoIf we can raise the level of immune response of the vaccine, that higher level of immune response will reach out and provide an extra level of protection to mismatched iants, he said.The expert said there was also a need to deploy booster vaccines ldquobefore the wave starts with any new iant, which is why the new expansion of the vaccine programme is being brought in.In its advice to ministers, the JCVI said that both the Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech vaccines can be given as a booster for adults ndash with equal preference given to both.In a speech to the Kingrsquos Fund annual conference on Monday, Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of the NHS in England, said NHS staff will ldquomove heaven and earth to vaccinate as many people as possible to ensure that people can enjoy Christmas with their loved ones.But she said volunteers are needed to help the ldquovital national effort of expanding the coronavirus vaccine programme, adding the service ldquowill not be able to do it alone.On Monday afternoon, health ministers from the G group of nations held an urgent meeting to discuss the impact of Omicron.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said Mr Javid had ldquounderlined the importance of Covid- surveillance and countriesrsquo abilities to quickly share findings with the international community as well as the role of booster vaccination programmes to strengthen our defences.The UK now has  confirmed cases of the iant.

It initially took us away from the lakeside but it kept our dog safe from the toxic algae which we were concerned may still be present in the water. Our kids tend to vanish when we enter a wood, their laughter telling us they are playing somewhere close by but out of sight. Such was the case on this day as we meandered up the hill, exploring and admiring the views.A roe deer suddenly bolted from the undergrowth in front of us, taking us all by surprise. It must have been watching us approach, standing still and unseen in the nearby undergrowth. I wonderedwersquod have seen it at allit hadnrsquot decided to run away.Although it was late November, the tree canopy still had a patchwork of autumn colour. The colours were made more vivid when the sun began to set, casting a stream of golden rays through the wood, and for a moment making the lake sparkle. Such moments canrsquot be planned, just enjoyed and appreciated when they happen.Then we heard wild screams from the younger kids. ldquoFaery apples! was the cry. Tiny apples, the size of cherries, carpeted the ground. They had never seen such small apples and came running holding handfuls of them, wonderingthey could eat them.I explained they were crab apples, fallen from the crab apple tree which grew all twisty near the path.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot eat them raw, I explained, ldquobut you can cook them and make crab apple jelly. The moment I said that, I knew Irsquod given myself a task. ldquoCan we make it tonight  was the predictable reply.I will be honest, I have never made crab apple jelly but there is a first time for everything and so we gathered a pile of the tiny apples.We spent more than three hours exploring the wood, finally reaching the end of the lake after many detours and explorations. We took a lower path back to the car, but my we and I noticed something the kids didnrsquot: the sun was below the horizon and it would soon be dark. We hadnrsquot paid much attention to the time but the sun had given us some warning earlier on as it spread its final rays through the wood.We didnrsquot say anything lest the kids got spooked, but we tried to discreetly speed our step so we would reach the car park before it got completely dark. It wasnrsquot easy, as the kids played in the fallen leaves and explored side paths.Finally they noticed. ldquoItrsquos getting dark, one said.ldquoNo, it is dark! replied another.Indeed it was, although we could still see where we were going. The trees now had a dferent guise: dark silhouettes making eerie shapes in the imagination.Then it happened.The moon appeared in the cloudless sky, a nearly full moon, initially reddish in colour, then bright. It was a primeval experience, the lsquobeaver moonrsquo in the sky, lighting our way through an ancient wood. Our son did his best to spook his sisters with tales of werewolves but that just set off a crescendo of imitated wolf howling from them all. It certainly made them all feel much braver in the dark, moonlit wood.When we finally reached the car, I had a tinge of melancholy that we were leaving.

Originally drawn at le-size, they help avoid the kind of scale-error that leads many of us to miss the smaller butterflies, like the little skipper or small blue, because they donrsquot fit our expectation of size.Butterfly hunting, and the kind of nerdy encounter documented a few years ago by Judith Hooper in Of Moths and Men, has long been caricatured as eccentric: middle-aged men in spectacles and baggy shorts galumphing round meadows with big catch-nets casting calls for Benny Hill or Charles Hawtrey.The actual work of entomologists like WilliamJones requires meticulous attention to detail and to tiny gradations of change now easily separated by macro photography and DNA analysis. The sheer intellectual as well as physical effort of gathering together a body of knowledge such as Icones cannot be underestimated, and nor can its collaborative nature, for every entry has a secret sharer in the name of the explorer and collector, be it Dru Drury or Sir Joseph Banks, James Edward Smith or John Francillon, who first recognised and gathered the specimens.A recent survey has shown that butterfly numbers in Britain have taken a further alarming e.

What did the last year mean to you  What did you achieve For me, I started working at CAS almost exactly a year ago. And in that time Irsquove written almost exclusively about one thing: social security.The country started the year in the depths of a second lockdown. The redundancies, lost hours and ill-health that stopped people from working meant that more of us than ever were relying on social security for our income. Around , people in Scotland are on Universal Creditright now.We saw the pound increase to UC extended in the spring for a further six months, but then ultimately taken away in the autumn budget.That increase was a leline for people, who will now face a really challenging winter without it.In better news, last week saw changes come into effect allowing working people on UC to keep more of their pay. CAS has long campaigned for such reforms, and the increases to Work Allowances - how much you can earn before your UC is reduced - will be particularly helpful for working families with children.But, of the , Scots on UC, nearly , will see zero improvement in their circumstances from this announcement. Namely, those who are unemployed. Until the labour market restabilizes and those people are able to find work, theyrsquore facing reduced support just when they need it most. At this time of year many of you will be getting ready to send out Christmas cards. Personally, I donrsquot send lsquophysicalrsquo cards but I do like the principle of sending little pre-Christmas messages to folk. So Irsquom going to take the liberty of using this column to send my first three lsquocardsrsquo of this year. First, to those on UC, the Citizens Advice network is here to help you. Our  CABs across Scotland offer free and non-judgmental advice on reducing your bills, managing your debts, or claiming any support you might be entitled to. That help is always there for you, whenever you need it. Oryou prefer you can use our moneymap.scot tool yourself.Second, to those in low-income work, you should checkyoursquore now entitled to additional support. The changes to Work Allowances and the Taper Rate mean more people than ever will be entitled to UC while in work, and in Scotland this can get you extra support like the Scottish Child Payment for those with children under . Therersquos no shame in seeking what yoursquore entitled to, and therersquos no need to struggle on a low income when help exists. Again, your local CAB is there to advise you.Finally, to the UK Government. You should reconsider the inadequate rate that social security is paid at. The pandemic has left a deep cut, and the cost of living is continuing to rise. People need to know theyrsquoll get the right support when they need it, now and in the future. So Ministers, please, invest in social security to help our most vulnerable people out of this pandemic and through the new year. Itrsquos simply the right thing to do.David Scott works in the Social Justice team at Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-politics-broken-dont-overlook-tories-contribution","story":"Some of the fundamental disagreements between political parties simply reflect the views of voters and that, surely, is as it should be. In Scotland that most obviously applies to the constitutional issue.But political partiescan manufacture ision, too.The prime example is Brexit, achieved through the referendum but which was won by a combination of egregious departures from the truth and dark money, which employed Cambridge Analytica to target voters through a huge and well-funded Facebook disinformation campaign.Then there is the predominantly Tory press, and its online presence, which mobilised voters through inflammatory rhetoric such as the infamous decrying of judges as ldquoenemies of the people.Other political parties, and their voters, are entitled to hold the perpetrators at armrsquosand more.Further, the Conservative-led coalition of - claimed ldquowe are all in this together in its response to the financial crisis, a patent untruth as austerity, by design, affected those on the lowest incomes most.Austerity was also economically counter-productive but achieved the ideological aim of shrinking the state, which in turn led to a lack of preparation for a pandemic by ignoring the recommendations of Exercise Cygnus, a cross-government exercise in  to test the countryrsquos response to a serious influenza pandemic, long before Covid struck.The Conservatives have been an uncompromisingly ideological party since  and have driven the UK rightward based on a minority of the vote backed up by dark donor money and willing media propagandists.If our politics are broken, as Mr Mackay says, it is largely because of an ideological unwillingness of Conservatives to compromise on the biggest issues and to play by their own rules. How many does it take to tango Councillor Alasdair Rankin , City of Edinburgh Council, Edinburgh.A COUNTRY FREE OF THE SNPJOHN Swinney asks what kind of country we Scots want to live in when the pandemic is over. The answer is one that is governed well, so that rather leaves him and his SNP colleagues out.Michael Watson, Rutherglen.FMrsquoS ldquoGULLIBLE SUPPORTERSROSEMARY Goringhas obviously been living in a vastly dferent Scotland to me since . She is lauding Nicola Sturgeon as some sort of top world leader which Scotland needs her ldquofor all our sakes.The only aspect of failure for the First Minister according to Ms Goring has been in education, which has been ldquounderwhelming hellip and woefully lacking. The majority of Scots will wholeheartedly agree ndash but education is not the only failure for Ms Sturgeon.There has been failure after failure, far too many to list here, all apparently forgotten about during Covid.Ms Goring needs to remember that in virtually every election in Scotland since , local and Holyrood, pro-Union votes outnumber pro-separatist votes and, come another referendum, given current statistics, the same will apply.Nicola Sturgeon is fully aware of this, hence her desire to deny supporters a vote and maintain her lucrative tenure for as long as possible. Just a pity that supporters are so gullible.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar, Aberdeenshire.DEVOLVING OF FULL WELFARE POWERS TO SCOTLANDTHE Agenda article by Poverty Alliance director Peter Kellywas a call for justice: justice for those who are often struggling in silence, those who feel cut off and those who often take the biggest hit when the government yield the austerity axe.Mr Kelly rightly highlights the cuts that have taken place in recent years by the Westminster Government two-child limit, a cut in Universal Credit, and the benefit cap.But as we do the sums with reference to the presentation of the forthcoming Scottish Budget on December , we may want to remind ourselves of actions the Scottish Government has taken in an effort to tackle child poverty.Since the establishment of Social Security Scotland in  we have seen the introduction of Best Start Grants, which have assisted over , families at a cost of poundm.There has also been the setting-up of the Scottish Welfare Fund, which has seen substantial increases to its budget during the pandemic and has assisted almost a million households.In an effort to give all new babies an equal start the SNP government introduced the Baby Box and has extended the roll-out of free school meals.Only this week, a new benefit has been introduced, the Scotland Child Disability Payment , child claimants will be moved onto it from the Disability Living Allowance.The Scottish government brought further assistance to this sector in  with the Child Winter Heating Assistance for claimants who receive the highest component of care allowance. And in an effort to address poverty, all Scottish government employees are paid the living wage.I applaud Mr Kellyrsquos call but we have to appreciate what has already been done in an effort to tackle the scourge of poverty, and recognise that only % of all welfare spend in Scotland is devolved. So perhaps he would add his support to a call for full welfare powers to be devolved to Scotland with immediate effect,we are to truly tackle poverty.Catriona C Clark, Banknock, Falkirk.AN ASSERTION OUT OF THIS WORLDWHILE I agree on the urgency for worldwide measures to combat global warming I am astonished that the SNP deputy leader, Keith Brown, has suggested in his speech to the partyrsquos annual conference that the lsquofuture of our planetrsquo depends on Scottish independence .Which planet would that be  The one with the Big Rock Candy Mountain, cigarette trees, soda fountain, milk and honey etc  Certainly not the one which I share with . billion others, many of whom have never heard of Scotland, and to whom Scotlandrsquos independence is irrelevant.R Russell Smith, Largs.LEADERS MUST NOT WORRY IN PUBLICCHRIS Whitty, Englandrsquos chief medical officer, should stop worrying.The government hesitated over restrictions twice, at great cost, needlessly worried in the first case whether people would accept a lockdown at all and, in the second, over Christmas restrictions.The job of leaders is not to worry in public. It is to get on and lead, above all to save lives.The economy is their great concern yet the great driver of mankind for many centuries has been the pursuit of profit and power.It is in the nature of business to adapt to circumstance.Felicity Graham, Perth.THE QUEENrsquoS LIFELONG SERVICETHE poor old Queen need not look to Joanna Blythmanfor sympathy, or regret, when the time comes. The quit button will take a hit instead.Yes, Diana was very dferent. She is never destined, it seems, to rest in peace. But lessons were learned, and time moves on.Ms Blythman is entitled to her views, of course. Hopefully, however, those of us of a mind to will respect a monarch who has served unfailingly over all these years. Surely we can grant her that.Brian D Henderson, Glasgow.WINDFARM HEADACHESI HAVE to congratulate our First Minister for trying to cope with the flicker created by wind-turbine blades while being interviewed on BBC Scotland inside Whitelee windfarmrsquos visitor centre.She sounded more grumpy than usual but kept talking, obviously in an attempt to show it wasnrsquot a problem despite the fact that a warning was issued at the start of the interview about the strobing effect created by the blades. Now she knows what many rural residents have to endure on a daily basis at this time of the year when the sun is low.Despite it being a simple process for windfarm operators to shut down their turbines when this debilitating effect occurs, many refuse because they will lose a few pennies in profit.What Sturgeon wonrsquot have hung around long enough to witness is the equally disturbing effect of night-time flicker when the blades pass in front of turbinesrsquo aviation lights.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those aged  and over are already eligible for a booster vaccine.Booster doses should be given no sooner than three months after people have had their second dose of an original vaccine ndash shaving three months off the current six-month wait, according to the JCVI.In further advice, young people aged  to  should be offered a second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine, no sooner than  weeks after their first dose.The JCVI also said that severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a booster dose no sooner than three months after completing their primary course of three doses.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons he accepted the JCVI advice in full, adding: ldquoWith this new iant on the offensive these measures will protect more people more quickly and make us better protected as a nation.ldquoIt represents a huge step up for our vaccination programme, almost doubling the number of people who will be able to get a booster dose to protect themselves and their loved ones.Englandrsquos deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told a Downing Street briefing that coronavirus iants were inevitable and Omicron was the ldquonew kid on the block for now but suggested the UK was in ldquouncharted territory as to whether it would take hold.He added: ldquoI think itrsquos true to say that scientists around the world, not just in the UK, unfortunately agree that this one is of increased concern.He said the ldquonumber of mutations present, already on first principle, makes us worry about a possible effect on vaccine effectiveness.Urging people not to panic, Prof Van-Tam said there were still uncertainties about how transmissible the iant is and its impact on severity of disease.ldquoOn the effects of the new iants, and how well vaccine effectiveness will hold up, here I want to be clear that this is not all doom and gloom at this stage, he said.ldquoI do not want people to panic at this stage. If vaccine effectiveness is reduced, as seems pretty likely to some extent, the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects on preventing severe disease.Prof Van-Tam said the booster campaign has ldquonever been more vital than at this point in time.He compared the situation to a football team with key players on a yellow card, saying that everyone needed to ldquoup their game in response.ldquoWe started with  players in the team with the Wuhan vaccine. You could say that we picked up a couple of injuries when Alpha came along and then Delta came along, those iants that are slightly dferent from the Wuhan original strain.ldquoWersquove had to use our subs off the bench to keep us in the game, but we are well in the game ndash you can see that with the current epidemiology in relation to Delta, that the vaccines are holding up very well and largely keeping us out of trouble.ldquoOmicron is like now picking up a couple of yellow cards to key players on top.ldquoWe may be OK but wersquore kind of starting to feel at risk that we might go down to  players andthat happens ndash or itrsquos a risk thatrsquos going to happen ndash then we need everyone on the pitch to up their game in the meantime.He added: ldquoWersquore not going to wait for the red card to happen, we are going to act decisively now and wersquore asking everyone to up their game, wersquore asking everyone to play their part in the urgency now of the booster programme, coming forward the moment you are called by the NHS.Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI told the briefing there was an increased likelihood of a ldquomismatch between current vaccines and the iant, which may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"But he said a boost of either Moderna or Pfizer could really push up the immune response and cutting the time between doses could mitigate any drop in vaccine protection.ldquoIf we can raise the level of immune response of the vaccine, that higher level of immune response will reach out and provide an extra level of protection to mismatched iants, he said.The expert said there was also a need to deploy booster vaccines ldquobefore the wave starts with any new iant, which is why the new expansion of the vaccine programme is being brought in.In its advice to ministers, the JCVI said that both the Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech vaccines can be given as a booster for adults ndash with equal preference given to both.In a speech to the Kingrsquos Fund annual conference on Monday, Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of the NHS in England, said NHS staff will ldquomove heaven and earth to vaccinate as many people as possible to ensure that people can enjoy Christmas with their loved ones.But she said volunteers are needed to help the ldquovital national effort of expanding the coronavirus vaccine programme, adding the service ldquowill not be able to do it alone.On Monday afternoon, health ministers from the G group of nations held an urgent meeting to discuss the impact of Omicron.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said Mr Javid had ldquounderlined the importance of Covid- surveillance and countriesrsquo abilities to quickly share findings with the international community as well as the role of booster vaccination programmes to strengthen our defences.The UK now has  confirmed cases of the iant.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

Stephanie Scott, Home from Home Co-ordinator at Ballymena said: “Casper is a very sweet natured boy with a lovely character who loves playing with his toys especially a ball. “He also has a sensitive side where he can be shy and anxious about open spaces and leaving what he considers to be his safe places. “We noticed this when he first came into kennels when he didn’t want to leave his kennel, so we felt that he would cope better in a foster home and he is enjoying le with his foster family who are patient and kind. “However, placing a dog in a foster home is only ever a temporary measure so it is now time for Casper to find his new family.“Casper is happy and content when he spends time with his foster family in the house or garden but upon leaving this space for walks he can become nervous. “We think many people will be able to relate to Casper’s worries following the pandemic when going out into the world again can lead to anxiety.“Casper very much enjoys company and is an affectionate dog once he knows you. “He likes someone being around most of the time and in his foster home he likes to sleep in the bedroom area.

If you have not already done this the app will prompt you to apply.If you have applied for your Covid certicate, the app will ask you to log-in to your NI Direct account. You may be asked for additional proof of identity.The app will then automatically retrieve your certicate from HSC NI once logged in.When your Covid certicate is valid, it will be green and you will be able to view your certicate as a QR code.How secure is my data on the digital COVIDcertNI app Your data is secure – the app does not share information about your vaccination.When you travel, the QR code will be scanned to ensure that your Covid certicate is valid.The certicate page has a holographic HSC logo which adds an extra layer of security.The app will not register any additional information about you and is based solely on data that is already registered by NI Direct and HSC NI.Venues will not be recording any personal information in relation to COVID certicates, the app is data minimised and will not share data.The verication app does not store any data. The verication app simply provides a quick way to very that the certicate presented is genuine.Will my booster vaccination be present on my certicate Current guidelines and legislation only require two doses of the vaccination to be deemed ‘fully vaccinated’.However, we are aware that some countries are asking for booster jabs to be reflected in Covid certicates.When policy is agreed by WHO   EU on the recording of boosters on the Covid Certicates, changes will be implemented to the Covid Certication Service to accommodate this.How long are Covid certicates valid for According to the NI direct website, the NI COVID certicate is valid for three months from the date of application. Digital certicates will automatically renew a week before they are due to expire.Can I request a paper version of the Covid- vaccination certicate If you cannot apply online, you can request a paper version using the telephone service   , available Monday to Sunday from am to pm.This is an application support line. Call handlers will not be able to provide advice on entry requirements to specic destinations or check the detail of your vaccination records.This process will take longer than the digital process and you will be required to very your identity in person by presenting documents at an appointed time and location.Once identity checks have been completed it may take up to  working days for the printed certicate to arrive.Most ReadMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingAnti-vaccine passport messaging in NI shopping centres ‘very concerning’A forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadDerry Girls star Jamie-Lee: ‘I got asked out all the time... by women’% support for united Ireland ‘remarkably low’, says DonaldsonLatest Northern IrelandDUP leader urges all to receive the Covid- vaccinePoots blasts ‘illogical’ checks on food travelling from GB to NIEveryone should get their booster jab - DUP leader Sir Jeffrey DonaldsonTwo men ‘died suddenly’ in Coleraine – policeMandatory Covid certication scheme ‘a politically-driven decision’ – GivanLatestFrance offers to restart migrant talksthe British get ‘serious’Adele’s record-breaking album  on course for second week at top of the chartsJailed organiser of Emiliano Sala flight has ‘no further evidence to give’DUP leader urges all to receive the Covid- vaccinePoots blasts ‘illogical’ checks on food travelling from GB to NI,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Nov   addthis, Local author Jane Buckley recently published the second of her four novels,Darkness,following the release of Stones Corner, Turmoilearlier this year. googletag.cmd.push The novels tell about the everyday realities of le in Derry and beyond from the early dark days of the Troubles in the s through to the Good Friday Peace Agreement in April . Jane said: When I look back at the launch of Stones Corner,Turmoilin February, I cant believe since then Ive completed a second novel,Darkness, and Im now working on the third,Light. Having begun to research the early s, Ill admit its been tough to find positive storylines. Ive also found it challenging, at times, to remain objective. For example, not only did I have to dig deep for good news stories, but events such as the HMS Maze hunger strikes along with the Troubles continuing to rage on was dficult. Thankfully, I came across some encouraging tales, and Ive developed them into progressive storylines. Jane said the global reception and fantastic reviews she has received for Turmoil and Darkness have been overwhelming. She added: “Readers from as far as New Zealand, the USA, Canada and even Denmark have remarked on how much theyve enjoyed the thrilling clf-hanging endings.  “Although one US reader was particularly upset when she got to the end of Turmoil without realising it was the first in a tetralogy. She was about to award me a four-star review until she got to the last chapter of Turmoil and instead sent me an email venting her frustration! I quickly contacted her and, thankfully, explained all, so much so, she gave me a five-star rating for Darkness. When Jane first completed Stones Corner, Turmoilduring lockdown, it began as a one-off project, a single novel but now its evolved into a series of four books or more formally known as a Tetralogy, a term for her which she admits she had to look up in a dictionary when one of her readers referred to it! Janes ambition was to educate the younger generation on le during the Troubles. However, she’s discovered that demo- graphically, most of her readers are women aged  upwards many of whom have remarked that through the descriptions of people and places in the books, theyve found themselves taken back in time and can closely identy with it. Marketing and promoting the novels has been a new experience for Jane. She explained: Marketing Stones Corner, Turmoil and Darkness, has been a whole new experience Ive learned so much in such a short time, some good, some bad!  “There are so many books published every year in the UK, circ.,, and an average authors sale per book is around . “Thankfully, my sales have exceeded that in just a matter of months, and with fingers and toes crossed, sales will increase over time as word of the books spread.  “Given Im an indie author, I must think out of the box when attracting readers – a continual challenge. Why would readers want to buy my book - a mere unknown  Yet they do, so I must be doing something right! Reviews are crucial to and it’s a fine line in nagging readers to leave them, but they’re critical for success. Local support for my work has proven invaluable readers are now recommending the books and knowing that they’re being read and discussed out there is satisfying beyond belief. Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol has added impetus to Janes desire to remind and encourage people to remember and learn everyday le during the Troubles.  I think its more important than ever that we dont allow the ugly head of sectarianism to rise again and threaten us with the horrors of another conflict and struggle. The Good Friday Agreement is still on thin ice and must be treated with care and common sense and clear thinking. You cant tell me theres anyone in this amazing country of ours would want to face conflict again  It would be a catastrophe for all of us. Jane has also received support from local authors, and in the process of introducing her work, investigated the opportunity of holding a Walled City Literature Festival in the city. She said: I was stunned at the amount and quality of Northern Irish based writers but couldnt see a local literature  for us to share and show off our work. As such, I spent a great deal of time putting a plan together for a three-day Derry-based festival over a weekend. Sadly, it didnt take happen because of a lack of funding. Maybe one day!  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The same goes for age and stage, for example, just because a jigsaw says  pieces and age from three years it does not mean your three year will be able to do it especiallythey’ve never done a jigsaw before. Remember, too, it’s all well and good saying he’ll be able to do it in the summer, that’s six months away,he can’t nearly do it now, and won’t be able to with a bit of help don’t buy it or there’ll be tears, snotters and grumps from you both. Personal  Social -doll and teddy to cuddle, feed, dance and play with or even just look cute sitting on the bed! Role Play Toys -such as tea set, pram, brush, hoover, kitchen to make dinner - or dinner for dolly! Imaginative Play -cars   fire engine   digger, train with track or a garage for cars -it’s got a ramp even better. Or Peppa Pig swing and slide, farm, Noah’s ark, bus with people to go on! Happy Land offer a great range in early imaginative play toys. Or traditional dolls house, rockets, play mobile sets etc. Animals -farm animals - maybe use pretend grass for the field. Animal figures to name, to later match baby to mum or add to imaginative play. Themed animals for older children - boys and bugs, girls and sea animals. Bricks And Block -mega blocks or wooden bricks to build and knock down and later to sort colours and shapes, or make into buildings and tunnels. Of course, there’s lego, meccano and magnetic building toys too. Puzzles -peg puzzles,  Cause And Effect Toys -for younger children, to press buttons, push levers left and right, turn handles for noise   lights   new sights, wooden hammer bench or a press and spin toy. Or maybe noisy toys, xylophone, drum and of course an old favourite the laser zapper that makes that awful noise.  Push and Pull toys -dog on a rope, rainbow wheel, duck with a handle - defo for those just walking. Outside -sit-on scooter, sit in car, balance bike, bubble fish, pull and play wagon or slide. Balls, to kick, throw, learn to catch or throw through a basket ball hoop. For older children hula hoop, roller skates or Space Hoppers!!! Special Place -tent with cushions, maybe a garden house or even just fairy lights and voile to go around her bed  Craft -chunky crayons and paintbrushes, finger paint, maybe try water colour paints for your budding artist, or an easel. Playdough sets, jewellery making, aeroplane building, wooden car making - what does your child like  Bath Time -ducks or boats to float, dolly to bath, smelly bath bubbles, or even a packet of jelly bath!  And to finish, the rhyme I say every year, buy me … and remember … Something I want, something I need, something to wear, something to read. Something so I can play a game with you, something that helps me learn too. Something to help my imagination grow, something creative to make or sew Something for inside, something for out and maybe a surprise I can tell my friends about! Everything doesn’t have to have batteries or be plugged in, Technology is great in small amounts, but it’s time to play with you that counts. So this Christmas time buy what I like and need, don’t go mad and buy up the shop, Think of the things we can do together,because its time to talk, sing, read and play, Which builds my future every day!

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, People Before Profit councillor, Shaun Harkin, has demanded that Prime-Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary, Priti Patel, be put up at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for their policies on immigration. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin was speaking at the United Against Racism rally last Sunday next to the backdrop of Derrys Emigration Statues at Queens Quay that symbolise the citys own refugees who had to flee the starvation and persecution of An Gorta Moacuter in the s. Drawing parallels with those that sought refuge around the world from Ireland back then, Cllr Harkin said the  refugees who died trying to cross the English Channel last week need not have done so. Citing the British Governments immigration policies, Cllr Harkin said Mr Johnson and Ms Patel should be held accountable at the highest level for creating a culture in Britain that demonised migrants and asylum seekers. He said: “Its fitting we are gathered by the Great Hunger statues. One million people died across Ireland through starvation and disease. “They didnt need to die but did because the British government decided profits for a tiny handful of very wealthy people was more important than saving hundreds of thousands of lives. “More than one million people fled Ireland in a short number of years. They traveled by whatever means they could in complete desperation and were not welcomed with open arms wherever they arrived. “They were described as famine Irish who were swarming across seas bringing backwardness, disease and poverty. Today, we see millions of people fleeing starvation, war, crushing poverty and climate change. Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced. “People from Iraq and Afghanistan are almost always included among those fleeing and among those drowning. “Both countries were brought to ruin by US and British government disastrous wars and occupations that succeeded in killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people and stuffing billions in blood profits into the bank account of arms manufacturers. “In  the toddler Alan Kurdi washed up on Greek beach. The world responded with grief, with outrage and demanded action. Nothing has changed. “Boris Johnson and Priti Patel should be going to the International Criminal Court for their racist immigration policies, for their efforts to demonise migrants and asylum seekers, for their role in the death of innocent people at sea, in trucks, in freezing camps.” Cllr Harkins ire was also directed at the European Union who he accused as being equally culpable as Mr Johnson and Ms Patel. He added: “Were told over and over how progressive EU bureaucrats are. Its a myth. “Twenty seven people died in the English channel last week but nearly  people have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year already. “Nearly , have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea since . This is the direct result of racist EU immigration policies. “EU bosses are spending tens of billions to strengthen Fortress Europe with surveillance, patrols and  kilometres of border walls. “Nothing has changed because the British government and EU bureaucrats prioritise upholding racist borders and the wealth of a handful of billionaires over taking real humanitarian action. “The British government and EU elites will never put humanity before billionaires, powerful corporations and war profiteers. “James Connolly, a migrant himself, opposed a border in Ireland but also opposed borders across Europe. He continues to speak for a vision directly opposed to that of elites and billionaires: “The day will come, and perhaps like a bolt from the blue, when the frontiers will not be sufficient to prevent the handclasp of friendship between the peoples. “But that day will come only when the kings and kaisers, queens and czars, financiers and capitalists who now oppress humanity will be hurled from their place and power. “And the emancipated workers of the earth, no longer the blind instruments of rich men’s greed will found a new society, a new civilisation, whose corner stone will be labour, whose inspiring principle will be justice, whose limits humanity alone can bound. “If we want to end English Channel and Mediterranean Sea drowning tragedies this is what we need to aspire to do.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mr Martin says the Government will have to keep its options open on further restrictions, explaining: NPHET have put in a caveat also that further measures can not be ruled out...can be very honest about that. His warning has been echoed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, who said that it is impossible to saythere could be a lockdown in the future. Minister Donnelly added that whilea lockdown cannot be ruled out, it is not where we are currently as a nation. Other measures that are due to be introduced by the govt include: People will be told to work from home, under recommendation from NPHETVaccine passes will be required to access theatres and cinemas but not at hairdressers, barbers or gymsStrict rules around mask wearing for indoor and outdoor settings.  In addition to the new rules, two other measures aimed at reducing transmission of the virus were also revealed.

However, with confidence ing as vaccination rates rise, and economies gradually open back up, people are on the hunt again. He commented, “Recruitment is becoming an employee’s market, and the volume of roles available gives workers more options, allowing them to select the business with the best offering. Furthermore, after  months of working from their own homes, many people don’t want to go back to the office full-time.” Some % of respondents to a survey of around , Irish employees by the University of Limerick’s Kemmy Business School said they agreed or strongly agreed that ‘my future career lies outside of this organisation’. This was regardless of whether they worked in multinationals, indigenous Irish companies, SMEs or the public sector. The survey found that % of managers, % of site leaders, % of regional leaders and % of global leaders based in Ireland also feel their future lies outside of their current organisation. Mr Kindlon said businesses that fail to prioritise employee wellbeing, professional development and company culture could see employees leave in their droves in search of an employer that better meets their needs – and struggle to recruit new talent to the business. “It’s crucial that businesses focus on becoming an employer of choice in order to sustain operations and accelerate growth as economies recover from the disruption of the pandemic.” While competitive pay and generous perks are key to employee satisfaction and retention, he said flexibility and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the job is just as important. “Multiple studies have shown that, more than ever, traditional office-based workers want a better work-le balance. That means flexible, remote or hybrid working to allow them to manage their professional and personal responsibilities in a way that benefits both their wellbeing and productivity.” “It means offering tangible, valuable employee benefits that put employee wellbeing at the forefront – so less of the ping pong tables, more of the competitive pension contributions and annual leave allowances. And it means nurturing a more positive company culture, in which the right to disconnect is respected – and so are employees.” He said the true impact of the great resignation remains to be seen, but employers who take the possibility of mass resignations and stled recruitment lightly will surely bear the brunt of this once-in-a-generation phenomenon as we move into . “Losing employees can be very costly. If multiple employees leave within a short time frame, depending on your company size you could be hit with huge costs as well as stled growth while you backfill positions.” There are a number of ways that companies can retain and engage current employees. These include offering a competitive mix of employee benefits with tangible value – such as enhanced pension payments, health insurance, above-statutory annual leave allowances, and flexible working to support employees’ work-le balance and wellbeing. Offering routes for career progression, either through promotion opportunities or by enabling employees to move to a dferent area of the business where desired and appropriate are also options. Mr Kindlon said the great resignation is both a threat and an opportunity for businesses in a wide range of industries. “While some businesses could see employees leave due to a number of contributing factors, employers with a competitive offering could see an increase in the talent available to bring into their teams.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way!

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.  BEST MOMENT OF THE SEASON BEATING DUNDALK AT LAST It might not have been the greatest game, but the victory over Dundalk on August  was long, long, long overdue. Derry City had suffered against the Lilywhites for close to a decade, and any type of win was needed just to get that monkey off our backs. It came as a result of a Jamie McGonigle penalty, and also gave Derry a win over one of the so-called big teams in quite a while. It was the first Brandywell victory over Dundalk since October, , when a Derry City team which included Ruaidhri Higgins won -. That win gave City some real belief and they followed that up with their first win at Oriel Park since  by winning - on the final day of the season to secure fourth place.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.  BEST MOMENT OF THE SEASON BEATING DUNDALK AT LAST It might not have been the greatest game, but the victory over Dundalk on August  was long, long, long overdue. Derry City had suffered against the Lilywhites for close to a decade, and any type of win was needed just to get that monkey off our backs. It came as a result of a Jamie McGonigle penalty, and also gave Derry a win over one of the so-called big teams in quite a while. It was the first Brandywell victory over Dundalk since October, , when a Derry City team which included Ruaidhri Higgins won -. That win gave City some real belief and they followed that up with their first win at Oriel Park since  by winning - on the final day of the season to secure fourth place.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It is popular amongst children and adults and generates festive cheer in every Irish household bringing a sprinkle of magic across the country. Each year there are guest appearances from many people ranging from celebrities to local heroes and family members of the participating children, youre sure to see a familiar face or two! Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script. The band were surprised by lead singer Danny who thought their performance was amazing and said they would give The Script a run for their money. Mr. ODonoghue invited the boys to perform at their soundcheck in Croke Park that year. X Robbie Keane  Domhnall appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and spoke about his hero Robbie Keane and listed out several facts about the soccer star. It was evident Mr. Keane was his role model as he had a vast knowledge about him, his career, and his recent injury that year. Domhnall was overwhelmed when Robbie Keane surprised him on set and he was allowed to ask questions about his career.  Evelyn Cusack  Johnny charmed viewers when he spoke about his passion for the weather and his admiration for Evelyn Cusack who presents the weather on RTE One. He told Ryan he plays a game called Whos it going to be for the weather forecast and always hopes it is Evelyn, he also invented a board game called Aimsir. Evelyn Cusack surprised him on set, and Johnny was thrilled to see her.  Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .  Graham Burke  Adam and Kayla Burke from Midleton, Co Cork were reunited with their dad Sergeant Graham Burke in a heartwarming reunion. Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportA SEASON IN PICTURES - From despair to Europe, the Derry City way! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

It is essential that we get security and management of car parking right at this popular location..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Annahilt A overcome Bright side  ","story":"IN the Senior Section of the East Down Churches League Annahilt A were good - winners over Bright and Banbridge A saw off their B team by the same score.The only game to go to five sets in the Annahilt and Bright match was the second singles when Kyle Graham put up an excellent display to better Victor Edgar -, -, -, -, -.In his second game Kyle was an -, -, - winner over Adrian Brown.Geoffrey Beattie had to work hard in his game with James Ferguson, but got home -, -, -, -.The big surprise of the night came when Beattie faced Arnold Ennis.

We wish both loyal players well.Annahilt C moved to the top of the Intermediate Section with a hard fought - victory over Banbridge D.Mervyn Cairns in the top two singles games was too experienced for Maya Forsythe and Katherine McConnell, while Jack Shaw kept up his winning run with good wins over Anna and Trevor Russell.James Cairns also added two more wins to his CV.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

He kept himself inconspicuous and moved about the near deserted glass and steel surroundings ashe didn’t want to be seen.Yet this man had once mixed with world leaders including presidents and prime ministers. He had played an important part in putting together an international peace treaty-settlement, which appeared to have ended a seemingly endless conflict. On his own turf he had made history by winning three general elections in a row. He was of course Bertie Ahern.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsHis dfident demeanour around the departure gates was a physical reminder about Enoch Powell’s dictum about all political careers ultimately ending in failure. Unfairly perhaps Ahern was being blamed in the Irish media and by some political rivals as having blindly guided the Republic into the Celtic Tiger crash, the financial crisis and the loss of economic sovereignty when the country was taken over by the International Monetary Fundand the European Central Bank .Such was the fickleness of southern Irish public opinion that the ex-Taoiseach they used to affectionately call Bertie now risked physical assault evenhe went for a quiet pint in one of his favourite North Dublin pubs. He had been attacked by a man in one of them and was occasionally verbally abused around the city.That morning in Dublin Airport before I boarded my flight to Gatwick I decided to go over and say hello to the former Taoiseach.I actually felt a bit sorry for Bertie. After all it couldn’t all be his fault that the Republic and its overheated economy had crashed and burned.Everyone down south bar the very poorest sections of society seemed during the boom years to be participating in the party. Every second taxi driver that picked up you in Connolly Station for instance couldn’t wait to tell you about the third holiday home they had bought on the Costal del Sol or the Black Sea.Whatever Ahern’s economic record he had one crowning achievement his neo-detractors couldn’t take away from him — Northern Ireland.I had seen him working hand in hand with Tony Blair on Easter Week  when their pragmatic powers of persuasion and negotiation secured the Belfast Agreement. Ahern had lost his mother that week and went straight from her funeral back to the talks in Castle Buildings working strenuously to get the deal done.In those talks Ahern crucially agreed to water down the North-South arrangements whichstronger would have resulted in the Ulster Unionists not signing up.  Essentially Bertie played a key role in creating ‘Sunningdale-Minus one’ – the ‘one’ being no Council of Ireland style cross border institution. Later Ahern struck up a genuinely warm rapport with the Rev Ian Paisley, which lasted long after both men left office and was part of the benign mood music around the St.Andrew’s Agreement.So, with all this in mind I went over to Ahern at his departure gate, introduced myself, shook his hand and struck up a conversation. I told him that despite everything he had played a progressive role in Northern Ireland especially in reaching out to unionists and clarying to them that his administration had no interest in Fourth-Green field nationalist aggrandisement that peace, co-operation and mutual respect was what it was all about.I still believe that Ahern’s contribution to Northern Ireland was and is commendable. Which is why it seemed out of character when he made his tribally-loaded remarks about ‘loyalist ghettoes’ earlier this month.Some commentators have suggested Bertie’s dismissal of unionist opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol was him signalling to Sinn Fein and its southern electorate that he wants to run for the Irish presidency. That prospect seems unlikely on two fronts. Sinn Fein will pick their own candidate who will be a titular independent but fall wholly under their influence. In addition, it is hard to see Fianna Fail nominating Ahern for Phoenix Park given that his candidacy will only recycle the era of economic bust and national humiliation.There is perhaps another deeper reason why even Ahern has apparently jumped on the Brit unionist bashing bandwagon of late: Brexit.Even for those of us who didn’t vote to leave the EU it is troubling to hear so many voices in the Republic engaging a form of neo-nationalist hysteria over the democratic decision of the UK to back Brexit. Nothing  it seems matters anymore but to punish the Britsfor walking away from the EU. Brexit seems to have flipped the brains of even some of the most pragmatic, cautious, normally pluralistic public figures in Dublin. They simply can’t get over it. In the meantime, relations between the unionist community and the southern Irish political class are rock bottom. Let’s hope the next speech or intervention Bertie Ahern makes sees himto type as part of a process to start repairing that relationship he once helped so carefully and intelligently to foster and nurture.• Peter Robinson Nov : East Belfast has good grasp of the NI protocol, Bertie• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Henry McDonald Nov : Football needs a civility code to tackle hatred• David Trimble: I feel betrayed by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which rips out the heart of the  Belfast Agreement• Owen Polley Nov : Windsor Park  NI-Republic football match was case study in nationalist myth making• Ben Lowry Nov : EU will see John Kyle’s remarks as sign of unionist support for NI Protocol• Neil McCarthy Nov : President Higgins is in a sentimental Irish republican bubble• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : Theresa May’s weakness ultimately to blame for NI Protocol• Book Review: Unionist leaders should read this vital defence of NI’s place in UK• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

When Northern Ireland’s striker, Jimmy Quinn, sent a volley arcing past Pat Bonner’s outstretched glove in the second half, Windsor Park erupted with joy.The theme song that night, ‘There’s only one team in Ireland,’ had already been firmly established.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The chant had been heard first in Dublin, when the Republic’s fans taunted northerners during a - win. That mockery hurt, because Northern Ireland was traditionally the dominant force in Irish football, qualying for international tournaments while the south struggled. Now that Northern Ireland had taken the lead against Jack Charlton’s side the song was redeployed. The stands at Windsor Park shook with noise, as the Green and White Army reminded their rivals that theirs was the original Irish football team veterans of three World Cups and reigning Home Nations champions.Billy Bingham, the Northern Ireland manager, was retiring from international footballUnfortunately, minutes later, the Republic equalised and secured their place in the US. I still maintain that goal came from a free-kick that should not have been given. Nigel Worthington shoulder-charged Eddie McGoldrick perfectly fairly, but the referee decided otherwise.These are the decisive moments that haunt fans, but they are part of the game and the Republic was deservedly destined for New York. The saddest thing was that Bingham did not get the winning end that his career deserved. However, his team had restored a lot of pride with its battling performance. Of course, Northern Ireland was a troubled place in November . The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist attacks like the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel massacre. Northern Ireland fans at the November  game at Windsor Park. The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist massacres yet the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinisterDespite this deeply unpromising context, the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinister. I was only a teenager, but I had already seen more vitriol at club games and I would do so many more times in the years to come. That’s why I was delighted to read Mark Rainey’s two page spread, in Wednesday’sNews Letter , about the myth that Windsor Park was a cockpit of hatred that night. He explained in detail how the hood got started. The Republic’s manager, Jack Charlton, believed that Northern Ireland should have gone easy on his team. Famously, after the final whistle, he said, “Theybattled too hard... They will get no favours from us... ever.”This typically graceless comment set in train a series of inventions, distortions and exaggerations that were repeated asthey were gospel by generations of players, fans and commentators.As Mark noted rightly, none of these accusations were levelled at the home fans in the immediate aftermath of the match.Many of the modern preconceptions about Northern Ireland fans’ conduct seem to have arisen from the Marie Jones’ play, A Night in November. Soon these details were cited by pundits who were nowhere near Windsor Park, but who nevertheless portrayed it as a bastion of bigotry.The contrast between what I saw that evening and the hysteria that followed made a strong impression on me, even as a schoolboy. It showed me vividly thata myth was repeated often enough in Northern Ireland it became accepted as fact, not just by its nationalist inventors, but by neutrals and well-meaning unionists too. Even Northern Ireland’s advocates now tell a story about how fans transforming their behaviour after this supposed “night of hate”. This narrative highlights the way the atmosphere at Windsor Park changed over many decades, becoming more inclusive and family friendly, but it repeats a caricature that was never fair or real.Football fans have rarely behaved perfectly. They are passionate, get carried away and sometimes act aggressively and badly. No doubt, some Republic fans found the atmosphere at Windsor Park in  unpleasant or uncomfortable. They were not, it must be said, supposed to be in the stadium in the first place.The myth of the “night in November” has been perpetuated for so long that it is now unlikely ever to be dispelled. Thank goodness that a journalist has the courage to challenge it and explain its origins. It will mean a lot to very many people.

An ecumenical service whose apologetic organisers were so keen not to upset nationalism that it barely mentioned Northern Ireland, and in which the most striking thing said was an attack on partition by Archbishop Martin, was nonetheless too much for President Higgins — and for the Republic population.Now there is a poll which shows that while a clear majority of southern voters still want a united Ireland, % of those surveyed, the enthusiasm for it is far short of overwhelming.It also shows low levels of support — well under % — for gestures to unionists such as changing the flag or changing the anthem in a single Irish state. In other words, unionists would be expected to suck up the republican narrative.Ireland, which since becoming a republic hasn’t even been able to bring itself to join the Commonwealth, unlike nations where the pre independence population suffered codied racial discrimination under British rule, would not even support doing so in the event of a all island state.One thing is clear in these results — thinking south of the border is still more old-style republican than ‘new’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The Cabinet will continue to meet this evening and tomorrow to monitor the developing situation and decidefurther action is required to protect peoplersquos health.Why is this happening The governments in the UK have all taken this move to prevent the spread of the new Omicron iant of Covid- which was detected in the UK this weekend. Two cases of the Omicron iant were located in Nottingham and Brentford in Essex. Scientists are concerned that the vaccines may not be protective against this iant.What does this mean for me If youfrom any country outside of the UK, you will have to take a PCR test and isolate until the test result is negative.However,you come from a red list country - Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, you will not be able to enter Wales. You will have tothrough England or Scotland and quarantine for  days and take PCR tests on day two and eight.MORE NEWS:New Covid iant found in UKWales largest youth organisation to mark centenary with world record attemptsWhat  is happening In a press conference last night, Boris Johnson also issued theof mandatory face coverings in shops and on public transport. This already applies in Wales as well as in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It does not apply to pubs and restaurants.Mr Johnson said border measures can ldquoonly ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status..removeChief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the country needs to ldquoface up to the possibility the iant will be a ldquomajor issueit turns out to be highly-transmissible and evades immunity.He said that the existing booster programme is the current priority, but that vaccine manufacturers believe they can tweak their existing jabs to better counter Omicron ldquoin about  days.Englandrsquos chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, told the press conference on Saturday that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationwill be tasked with looking at whether boosters can be extended from the over-s to the over-s.They will also consider whether second doses should be offered to  to -year-olds, and whether the waiting time before a booster jab could be reduced. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMillions more people in the UK will become eligible for a third booster dose after early evidence suggested that higher antibody levels may protect better against the iant.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis now advising that all adults aged  to  should be offered a booster dose, in order of descending age groups, to increase their level of protection. Those aged  and over are already eligible for a booster vaccine.Booster doses should be given no sooner than three months after people have had their second dose of an original vaccine ndash shaving three months off the current six-month wait, according to the JCVI.In further advice, young people aged  to  should be offered a second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine, no sooner than  weeks after their first dose.The JCVI also said that severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a booster dose no sooner than three months after completing their primary course of three doses.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons he accepted the JCVI advice in full, adding: ldquoWith this new iant on the offensive these measures will protect more people more quickly and make us better protected as a nation.ldquoIt represents a huge step up for our vaccination programme, almost doubling the number of people who will be able to get a booster dose to protect themselves and their loved ones.Englandrsquos deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told a Downing Street briefing that coronavirus iants were inevitable and Omicron was the ldquonew kid on the block for now but suggested the UK was in ldquouncharted territory as to whether it would take hold.He added: ldquoI think itrsquos true to say that scientists around the world, not just in the UK, unfortunately agree that this one is of increased concern..removeHe said the ldquonumber of mutations present, already on first principle, makes us worry about a possible effect on vaccine effectiveness.Urging people not to panic, Prof Van-Tam said there were still uncertainties about how transmissible the iant is and its impact on severity of disease.ldquoOn the effects of the new iants, and how well vaccine effectiveness will hold up, here I want to be clear that this is not all doom and gloom at this stage, he said.ldquoI do not want people to panic at this stage. If vaccine effectiveness is reduced, as seems pretty likely to some extent, the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects on preventing severe disease.Prof Van-Tam said the booster campaign has ldquonever been more vital than at this point in time.He compared the situation to a football team with key players on a yellow card, saying that everyone needed to ldquoup their game in response.ldquoWe started with  players in the team with the Wuhan vaccine. You could say that we picked up a couple of injuries when Alpha came along and then Delta came along, those iants that are slightly dferent from the Wuhan original strain.ldquoWersquove had to use our subs off the bench to keep us in the game, but we are well in the game ndash you can see that with the current epidemiology in relation to Delta, that the vaccines are holding up very well and largely keeping us out of trouble.ldquoOmicron is like now picking up a couple of yellow cards to key players on top.ldquoWe may be OK but wersquore kind of starting to feel at risk that we might go down to  players andthat happens ndash or itrsquos a risk thatrsquos going to happen ndash then we need everyone on the pitch to up their game in the meantime.He added: ldquoWersquore not going to wait for the red card to happen, we are going to act decisively now and wersquore asking everyone to up their game, wersquore asking everyone to play their part in the urgency now of the booster programme, coming forward the moment you are called by the NHS.Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI told the briefing there was an increased likelihood of a ldquomismatch between current vaccines and the iant, which may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production edfcbdecfffbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTcz ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"But he said a boost of either Moderna or Pfizer could really push up the immune response and cutting the time between doses could mitigate any drop in vaccine protection.ldquoIf we can raise the level of immune response of the vaccine, that higher level of immune response will reach out and provide an extra level of protection to mismatched iants, he said.The expert said there was also a need to deploy booster vaccines ldquobefore the wave starts with any new iant, which is why the new expansion of the vaccine programme is being brought in.In its advice to ministers, the JCVI said that both the Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech vaccines can be given as a booster for adults ndash with equal preference given to both.In a speech to the Kingrsquos Fund annual conference on Monday, Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of the NHS in England, said NHS staff will ldquomove heaven and earth to vaccinate as many people as possible to ensure that people can enjoy Christmas with their loved ones.But she said volunteers are needed to help the ldquovital national effort of expanding the coronavirus vaccine programme, adding the service ldquowill not be able to do it alone.On Monday afternoon, health ministers from the G group of nations held an urgent meeting to discuss the impact of Omicron.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adeffbafbdceYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMMjkwOTM ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said Mr Javid had ldquounderlined the importance of Covid- surveillance and countriesrsquo abilities to quickly share findings with the international community as well as the role of booster vaccination programmes to strengthen our defences.The UK now has  confirmed cases of the iant.

That’s the appeal to the public from Health Minister Robin Swann, as public health measures are activated in response to the Omicron iant’s emergence. Mr Swann also underlined the continuing importance of vaccination in the battle against all strains of the virus. “Subject to the Speaker’s approval, I intend to update the Assembly on Monday in regard to the measures being deployed in response to the emergence of the Omicron iant,” the Minister said. “These include the addition of a number of countries to Northern Ireland’s Red List for international travel. “The emerging picture on the Omicron iant is being very closely monitored and we will continue to liaise with public health colleagues in the other UK jurisdictions and the Irish Republic.” The Minister urged everyone to adhere to the basic steps that will help stop the spread of all iants of COVID-. These include: getting vaccinated and getting your booster dose when eligible, wearing a face covering, limiting contacts, keeping rooms well-ventilated or meeting outdoors when possible, working from homepossible, and practising good hand hygiene. If you have symptoms of COVID- – a high temperature OR a new, continuous cough OR a loss of or change in sense of smell, or taste, no matter how mild – please isolate and get a PCR test as soon as possible. The Health Minister continued: “There are concerns that the Omicron iant may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines. That is not confirmed and it is important to emphasise that. “Furthermore, eventhis does turn out to be the case, it remains vital that as many people as possible get their first and second doses and their booster vaccines when eligible. “I have been assured that our vaccines should still provide a level of protection against Omicron. The importance of that cannot be overestimated. Secondly, we know that our vaccines are very effective against the Delta iant. Delta very much remains the predominant iant in NI at the current time, is a very real and present risk to our population, and is continuing to cause serious illness and, in some tragic cases, death to our fellow citizens.” Mr Swann continued: “Plans have been activated to identy any spread of the new iant in NI. “Using passenger locator data, the Public Health Agency is identying and contacting iniduals who have recently arrived in Northern Ireland from Red List countries. “They and their household members will be asked to self-isolate and undertake PCR tests. If any positive cases are detected, the sample will then undergo Whole Genome Sequencingto determine the iant type. If the new iant is confirmed here, all appropriate health protection actions will be carried out and the public will be informed as appropriate.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbebdeecbdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbbcaed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638199683305.jpg--covid_19___mon_29th_november_figures.jpg?163819968300","title":"covid  mon th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The new restrictions come into force after the Omicron iant was found to be in both England and Scotland. From Tuesday, anyone arriving into Northern Ireland from non-red list countries , including those who are fully vaccinated, will now be required to self-isolate and take a PCR test before the end of day two.
