If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Rittenhouse walks does reputation smears Biden Libs","story":"Share this articleKyle Rittenhouse, teen accused of shooting Kenosha protesters, arrested in Illinois - CBS NewsRittenhouse and Charlottesville Cases Put Fascism on TrialWhite domestic terrorists like Kyle Rittenhouse are held to a different standardKyle Rittenhouse Accused of Shooting Three People at Kenosha Protests"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan takes political lobbying campaign TV calls mandatory paid family leave US","story":"Work a white Oscar de la Renta blouse like MeghanThe Duchess of Sussex has been impressing us with her wardrobe of late.

Photograph: RTÉCervicalCheck campaigner Vicky Phelan has spoken about how in recent weeks she did not feel she would live to “see Christmas,” after deciding to stop chemotherapy treatment for her cancer. Ms Phelan, who was given a terminal cancer diagnosis in 2018, said she stopped chemotherapy due to the intense side effects, opting instead to focus on making “memories” with her family. “I don’t want to die, I’m a young woman, I have young children, that’s what made me want to fight for them … You still want more, everyone wants more,” she told RTÉ’s Late Late Show on Friday. Ms Phelan’s High Court action, which was settled in April 2018 over the incorrect reading of her smear test, brought the CervicalCheck scandal to light. It later emerged that more than 100 other women had not been informed of an audit that had revised their earlier, negative smear tests. “Four weeks ago I didn’t think I’d see Christmas, that’s how real this is for me … At this stage, I’ve been fighting this terminal part of the disease since 2018,” she said. A post shared by RTÉ One (@rteone)“I’ve always known this cancer is incurable … I have been very realistic about it,” she said. While there was always a hope for a “miracle drug,” often new treatments came with side effects and other “costs to your health,” she said. Ms Phelan said after ending treatment she had travelled to the United States to receive, she came back to Ireland having “exhausted all my options”. Initially after returning she tried chemotherapy. “I really want to see Christmas, so I had to do it for the kids,” she said. “I did two sessions of the chemotherapy. I got the treatment on the 18th of October and I could not get out of bed until the 29th of October … I was sick, in pain, from one side effect to another,” Ms Phelan said. “I couldn’t even have a conversation with the kids, that’s how bad it was,” she said. “I would rather my children have memories of doing stuff with me, and if I go sooner, so be it,” she said. The conversation to tell her two children she would be stopping chemotherapy had been “tough,” she said. Ms Phelan spoke about planning her own funeral, stating she wanted a humanist service, with a “bit of colour” and music, rather than “doom and gloom”. She criticised the deference often shown to doctors. “I think the medical profession is one we haven’t really tackled, we still look at doctors as if they are all knowing, and that’s not the case,” she said. Irish people were “too quiet for our own good,” and she encouraged others to ask questions about their care. “There’s a lot of stuff that goes on with women’s bodies, and it is embarrassing but you have to be able to talk about them, because otherwise you end up in a situation like me … When you know your body, don’t be afraid to ask questions about it,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"garda whistleblower controversy had devastating effect says n%C3%B3ir%C3%ADn o sullivan","story":"Former Garda commissioner, Nóirín O’Sullivan in the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin. ‘It is dehumanising to be at the centre of this vortex.’  Photograph: Laura HuttonThe Garda whistleblower controversy had a “devastating” effect on Nóirín O’Sullivan and her family, the former Garda commissioner has said in her first interview since her decision to resign in November 2017.People called to her home and abused her adult children, and armed gardaí were sent to the sittings of the Disclosures Tribunal in Dublin Castle such was the atmosphere created by allegations against her that have since been shown to be untrue.In a separate interview, the former tánaiste and now MEP, Frances Fitzgerald, described as “harrowing” the experience of having to leave government because of a false allegation.The publication of the fourth interim report of the Disclosures Tribunal in July of this year means that all of the allegations against the two women that were made during the controversy have been dismissed.Ms O’Sullivan was accused of being privy to or involved in attempts to target or discredit Garda whistleblowers Maurice McCabe and Nicky Keogh after they made protected disclosures.Ms Fitzgerald was accused of knowing about but failing to stop a plan by Ms O’Sullivan to use false allegations against Mr McCabe at the confidential hearings of a commission of inquiry that was investigating complaints made by Mr McCabe.The Disclosures Tribunal found that the former head of the Garda Press Office, David Taylor, and the then Garda commissioner, Martin Callinan, had been involved in a campaign to smear Mr McCabe.Ms O’Sullivan said there was a “bombardment” of untrue allegations about her made in the Dáil and reported in the media.“The cumulative effect of it all is that it is dehumanising. That is the word I would use. It is dehumanising to be at the centre of this vortex, and feel that you are a political football, which I felt very deeply.“I had people call to my home. I had people abusing my children. I had such horrible things happen. Even at the tribunal, for example, we had to, albeit quietly, have armed detectives there. Because there were people, you know. It attracts this. And if this is allowed to continue, then actually democracy begins to break down, and society begins to break down.”She said she was supportive of the Oireachtas committee system but her experience of appearing before them as a witness had been that some members were solely focused on “looking for sensational headlines”.Ms Fitzgerald said genuine issues had to be dealt with during the whistleblower controversy, but “you don’t try and right one injustice by creating others, and I think that is a fairly basic point in democracy”.“There was an awful lot of rushing to judgment,” said Ms Fitzgerald, who is now a Fine Gael member of the European Parliament.She argued in the Dáil that the proper way to deal with the allegations was to allow for due process, but the Dáil had not done that, even though it had already established a tribunal.When the tribunal’s reports are taken together, she said, the consequences of rushing to judgment can be seen.“A lot of what was taken as absolute truth, by the Dáil, by the media, turns out actually not to have been true.”False allegations were made by Mr Taylor, against Ms O’Sullivan and her husband, James McGowan, who was at the time a detective inspector.Ms O’Sullivan said she and her husband, who retired as a detective chief superintendent, had to end their Garda careers with a public assumption that they had failed to live up to the standards they had tried to live by.They had to wait for a number of years for tribunal reports to be published that said, “well, this is not true,” the former commissioner said.It was claimed in the Dáil that Ms O’Sullivan was party to, or had known about, the targeting of the whistleblowers, Mr McCabe and Garda Keogh.All of these claims about Ms O’Sullivan have been dismissed in tribunal reports, with the report in July saying Garda Keogh’s claim was meant to be “extremely damaging” to the then commissioner and was made without any basis.The false claims against Ms O’Sullivan and Ms Fitzgerald were aired in the Dáil, where politicians enjoy absolute privilege in terms of being sued.In his tribunal report in July, Mr Justice Seán Ryan noted how false allegations made by Garda Keogh against a number of members of An Garda Síochána had been disclosed in the Oireachtas.“The problem was that the allegations could not be answered by the persons accused in the forum in which they were raised,” he said.Mr Taylor, who was removed as head of the Garda Press Office by Ms O’Sullivan following the resignation of her predecessor Mr Callinan, falsely alleged that she had known, as deputy commissioner, about a campaign to discredit Mr McCabe.He also falsely claimed that Ms O’Sullivan’s husband was party to a conspiracy to cover up evidence of her knowledge of the smear campaign.In a tribunal report in October 2018, the then tribunal chairman Mr Justice Peter Charleton dismissed the allegations and said Mr Taylor’s “viciousness” towards Ms O’Sullivan arose because he was “suffused in bitterness” because she had moved him from the Garda Press Office.Claims by Garda Keogh and another whistleblower Garda Keith Harrison that they had been targeted in the wake of making protected disclosures contributed to calls in the Dáil for Ms O’Sullivan’s resignation on the basis that she was not protecting whistleblowers.“The assumption was that I was targeting and discrediting whistleblowers, without a shred of evidence to support that,” she told The .In a tribunal report in November 2017, Mr Justice Charleton said Garda Harrison’s claims against Garda colleagues and the child and family agency, Túsla, were “entirely without any validity”.In his report in July, Mr Justice Ryan, who replaced Mr Justice Charleton as tribunal chairman in late 2018, said that all of Garda Keogh’s claims about being targeted were unfounded.Ms Fitzgerald said there were lessons to be learned by politicians and the media from the whistleblower era, which threw up serious matters that had to be investigated.“How did the Dáil deal with them? How did the media deal with them.”In her case the publication of a Department of Justice email in which she was informed of a dispute at the O’Higgins Commission, led to claims that she had known about, but done nothing to stop, an alleged attempt to discredit Mr McCabe at the commission’s confidential hearings, by using false allegations.In the Disclosures Tribunal’s third interim report in October 2018, Mr Justice Charleton said that the transcripts of the commission hearings showed “nothing of the kind alleged” ever happened.Leaked “snippets” of transcript, and the email that referred to a row at the commission, had “somehow transmogrified” into an allegation that Mr McCabe had been “maliciously accused” at the commission of false offences, and that Ms Fitzgerald had “stood back and let it happen”.No one, never mind the Garda commissioner, had ever accused Mr McCabe of any crime at the commission, “or hinted at it, or attempted any innuendo about it”, the judge said.He said Ms Fitzgerald had been correct to decide, in response to the email, that it was not for her to interfere with the commission hearings and that she should let the sole member of the commission, Mr Justice Kevin O’Higgins, “sort out” any dispute that might have arisen there.On the same day, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on justice, Jim O’Callaghan, said “the tánaiste was aware of the strategy of the Garda commissioner to attack and to try to personally destroy the reputation of Sgt Maurice McCabe.”“What happened to me in the Dáil was completely connected with the idea that I knew there was a strategy to undermine the whistleblower,” Ms Fitzgerald said. “But there was no strategy, and I did not.”"},{"url":null,"title":"urgent solution needed for north in post brexit arrangements sefcovic","story":"European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic warned that the use of Article 16 by the British government would affect the overall trade agreement with the UK. Photograph: John ThysEPAPoolNorthern Ireland urgently needs stability in its post-Brexit arrangements and for Britain to come to an agreement with the European Union on how to ease their implementation, the European Commission has said.EU Brexit point man and European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic met his British counterpart David Frost following a perceived thaw in relations as the London government appeared to step back from using the sensitive Article 16 clause of the Northern Ireland Protocol.Mr Sefcovic said the change in tone was welcome but that concrete progress needed to be made swiftly, while Lord Frost warned that Article 16 was still on the table.“It is essential that the recent change in tone now leads to joint tangible solutions in the framework of the protocol,” Mr Sefcovic said in a statement, pointing to the need for a deal to ensure the transit of medical supplies in particular.“There is a genuine urgency. We welcome the progress this week. We now need to press on and get this crucial issue across the line. This is a real test of political goodwill.”The EU maintains that a package of proposals it has set out to ease the implementation of the protocol, designed to avoid the need for a hard border across the island after Brexit, would halve customs formalities and identity and physical checks by 80 per cent. The British side has insisted that more is needed, however. In a statement after the talks, Lord Frost said that “significant gaps remain across most issues”.“Looking forward, the United Kingdom’s preference remains to secure a solution based on consensus,” he said. “But any such solution must constitute a significant change from the current situation, materially ease practical problems on the ground, and safeguard political, economic and societal stability in Northern Ireland. “If no such solution can be found, we remain prepared to use the safeguard provisions under Article 16.”The British government has previously insisted that any deal will require the removal of the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in overseeing the protocol, something that the EU side has ruled out, as it is a requirement for Northern Ireland to participate in the single market.Practical issuesAs the two sides remain far apart on the question, they have been focused on solving smaller practical issues, leaving the question of the ECJ until last to see if solving everything else can help surmount it.Technical talks between the sides, focused on customs arrangements and ways to ensure a seamless flow of medicines into Northern Ireland, have been taking place this week.In an address prior to Friday’s talks, Mr Sefcovic warned that the use of Article 16 by the British government would affect the overall trade agreement with the UK. This, he said, was because the Withdrawal Agreement, which the protocol is part of, and the EU-UK trade deal are interwoven. “The two agreements are intrinsically linked, one cannot exist without the other,” Mr Sefcovic said. “Settling the orce has always been and remains a precondition for our future relationship.” Officials believe the triggering of Article 16 would have a serious impact on the Irish economy, and have warned that it would be a signal of a serious deterioration in EU-UK relations.“Our solutions can become reality if the UK plays its part,” Mr Sefcovic said. “We need the UK government to reciprocate the significant move the EU has made.” How is Brexit affecting you?

The Austrian chancellor has also announced deeply authoritarian plans to make it a legal requirement to get vaccinated against Covid by next year.Swathes of the rest of Europe are also getting tough in a bid to tackle a fourth wave with yet more restrictions – even though the need to do so suggests that the restrictions didn’t work well enough in the first place.Warning that “unspecified” rules would be introduced in some of Germany’s worst-hit states, Chancellor Angela Merkel set the tone for the Continent on Thursday as she dramatically declared: “It is absolutely time to act.”She announced that the unvaccinated would be stopped from visiting bars, restaurants and theatres if hospitalisation rates got too high. It came as hospitals in Bavaria have come under so much pressure that patients are having to be transferred to neighbouring countries for treatment.The problem is even more acute in parts of Eastern Europe, where endemic corruption has led to a distrust in the medical system that makes concerns about the PPE contracts awarded to Matt Hancock’s pub landlord look piffling by comparison.All of which makes Britain appear rather less of a basket case than the world has been making out.Since the summer, the UK has been condemned internationally as “plague island”.The New York Times trashed Freedom Day, arguing that it was “too soon to declare victory”. Overcautious Americans from Democratic states have tiptoed over the Pond with trepidation since travel has been allowed again, nervous about Britain’s apparent sense of Covid carelessness.Meanwhile, our fellow Europeans have treated us like a petri-dish of coronavirus infection, ever since we ditched mandatory measures.At one point over the summer, British travellers to countries like Croatia found themselves singled out – and asked to take an extra Covid test, along with travellers from Russia, where only 35 per cent of the population are fully vaccinated, and tourists from India, where the rate is just 28 per cent.Yet without wishing to sound complacent, which would be foolish given that UK infections are still among the highest in Europe, it now seems that Britain wasn’t quite so reckless after all to embrace freedom over the summer.Rather than mandating scientifically questionable measures like face-masks, we have followed the actual science of inoculation – vaccinations like the Oxford AstraZeneca jab that Angela Merkel initially refused to take after the German authorities had declined to approve it for those over 65. Remember the reputational damage French president Emmanuel Macron sought to inflict on the jab by deeming it only “quasi-effective” for older people?The figures, however, speak for themselves. A study by the UK Health Security Agency this week found that at least 20 weeks after being fully vaccinated with two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness against symptomatic disease was 44 per cent, while two weeks after receiving the booster dose, protection against symptomatic infection increased to 93 per cent.There appears to be a common theme running through the countries that are now toying with the idea of lockdowns in the post-jab era – and it is their comparatively low rates of vaccine take-up.Germany’s 67 per cent vaccination rate is higher than in Austria, but not by much. In Saxony, just 58 per cent of the population are fully vaccinated. Eastern European nations mistrustful of the state following communist rule also have hesitancy rates proportional to bed occupancy.Britain’s total vaccination rate is no longer world-beating, but it is still relatively high. And on boosters we are doing well, with 24 per cent having received a third dose – crucially focused on those most vulnerable to falling seriously ill from Covid.Yes, we wrongly delayed vaccinating children, but the truth is that while Boris Johnson has spoken of storm clouds gathering over the Continent, our hospital admissions, which have fluctuated at between 700 and 1,000 a day for nearly four months, now also seem to be starting to trend downwards as the boosters take effect.It was also, arguably, not unhelpful for people to have acquired immunity naturally during the summer and autumn months.As Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, put it: “The UK is now in a better position in terms of immunity than most of Europe because we’ve had a lot of infections and we’re now rolling out the booster jab.”Of course, we must remain vigilant, since there is always a chance that a new Covid variant or a flu epidemic could once again overwhelm the NHS, which struggles to cope even in a normal winter. But it would be absolute madness to slavishly follow Europe down the path of yet more lockdowns. It was one thing to do it when the country was unvaccinated – but quite another to do it now.Moreover, the UK surely provides Europe with all the evidence it needs to realise that it is vaccinations – rather than passporting and mask-wearing, let alone lockdowns – that have reduced serious illness and hospitalisations? What is clear, as Europe heads for a “serious emergency” and a “terrible Christmas” is that their supposedly mitigating measures have not stopped the virus from spreading.So the time has surely come for our Continental cousins to accept that there isn’t much more they can do besides encouraging the minority of people who remain resistant to accept the jab.Had they followed Britain’s lead on vaccinations in the first place and not indulged in political attacks on the AstraZeneca jab – I doubt they would be needing to lock down again, or resort to making jabs mandatory, which many will view to be a breach of people’s right to choose.There also needs to be a shift in thinking across the Channel. Thanks to more than three months free of restrictions, the British have gone someway towards once again accepting death as a consequence of life. Of course it is tragic that hundreds of people still die of Covid every day – but many of us have come to realise that Covid is likely to become endemic and that we cannot continue to live in fear.It is perhaps worth remembering what the Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said about this pandemic at the very beginning. “The great majority of people will not die from this,” he said during a Downing Street press conference on May 11, 2020. “A significant proportion of people will not get this virus at all ... Of those who do, some of them will get the virus without even knowing it ... Of those that get symptoms, the great majority, probably 80 per cent, will ... not need to go to a doctor. An unfortunate minority will have to go as far as hospital, but the majority of those will just need oxygen and will then leave hospital. And then a minority of those will end up having to go to severe and critical care and some of those sadly will die. But that’s a minority – it’s 1 per cent or possibly even less than 1 per cent overall.”That was long before anyone had even come up with a jab. It’s a sad statistic, but one the vaccinated majority can live with.More from NewsWe need a sense of proportion about the problems facing womenTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes takes the stand in her own criminal fraud trialDutch police open fire on anti-lockdown rioters amid \u0026#39orgy of violence\u0026#39It’s school shoes, not the uniform, that cost an arm and a legPictured: Teenage ballerina dances on one of world’s first custom-made \u0026#39en pointe\u0026#39 prosthetic legWet wipes and ketchup sachets could be banned in government crackdown on single-use plasticMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"crying ministers spark backlash against new tory wets","story":"The Tories never used to be an emotional bunch.

But that has not stopped one stone-hearted Conservative MP muttering: “Matt Hancock, Ben Wallace and now Alok Sharma – apparently crying is the new leading.” It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase “Tory wets”.Nicky Haslam, the Eton-educated society interior designer, has made a name for himself as the arbiter of good taste. Examples on his exhaustive list of things that are “common” include signet rings, award ceremonies, heli-skiing and Richard Branson.There is one surprising thing that has escaped, however: charity shops. At a recent event he wore a fetching mustard corduroy suit which he told me he “bought in a second-hand shop”. Haslam shops in Primark, too, once telling me “everything I’m wearing is from Primark – it’s well made and it’s stylish”, adding that “other designer brands are a rip off”. He does draw the line at cheap shoes. That’s obviously a step too far.Westminster Council is midway through a controversial plan to replace 299 antique gas lamps, which bathe the area in a “Dickensian glow”, with modern lighting. Local opposition is growing, and has won the support of ex-foreign minister and political diarist Sir Alan Duncan. “They are the most famous street lights in London,” says Sir Alan, “and it reflects very poorly on the council that residents have neither been informed nor consulted. It is about the only classic Georgian residential area left in Westminster. It is often used for filming. It is essential that the original lamp posts remain in place if ever the light source is replaced.”Other local residents include Jacob Rees-Mogg and the Prince of Wales. Will Sir Alan’s involvement be enough to convince them to break cover?At a  reader event this week, author Sebastian Faulks was asked which of his books gives him the most pride. He of course answered Birdsong, his First World War novel, and told of its unusual beginnings during a visit to Amiens in France. “I had a tiny little Fiat,” he said. “I didn’t have any paper so I fiddled in the glove department and started scribbling in the drivers’ manual the very words in which I knew this love affair would happen.”On really important matters, he also revealed which book had made him the most money – his 2008 James Bond spy thriller Devil May Care, billed as “Sebastian Faulks writing as Ian Fleming”.“I did feel when I’d finished Birdsong that I’d written something quite inidual,” he said. “But the one that made the most money was the James Bond book.

Public opinion is on his side, with a clear and growing majority of Britons believing the sculptures should be returned by the British Museum.In Boris Johnson, he has a counterpart who keeps a bust of the ancient Athenian leader Pericles in his No. 10 office for inspiration. And if Johnson should decide he wants to nudge the British Museum towards returning the Marbles, he need only pick up the phone to the new chairman of its trustees, the former Tory chancellor George Osborne.Meanwhile Amal Clooney, perhaps Britain’s most recognisable human rights lawyer, is advising the Greek Ministry of Culture on its options and tactics.There is, then, growing support for the Elgin Marbles – which have been contentious since the day they arrived in Britain more than 200 years ago – to be returned to Greece, where they would be housed in a purpose-built museum that stands in the shadow of the Parthenon itself. Waiting there are the sculptures that Lord Elgin, the former British ambassador to the Ottoman empire, left behind, with the whole collection split roughly 5050 between London and Athens.Mitsotakis’s comment that the Museum was being “anachronistic” in its approach also referenced a much wider debate about the return of artefacts – and human remains – to their countries of origin, which could radically reshape the collections of museums and art galleries across the western world.Some internationally renowned institutions have already begun returning their treasures. Earlier this year the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC sent a spectacular gold breastplate, the Sol de Soles, back to Peru, where it was made more than 2,000 years ago. A mass repatriation of African cultural objects is also underway from museums around the world, with Benin Bronzes from Nigeria among the most famous. Some are being sent from museums in Britain.The British Museum, then, might understandably be worried that it could be denuded if it bows to pressure to give back the Elgin Marbles, though that is not its official reason for refusing their return. What is undisputed is that the return of the Marbles would be the world’s most significant such repatriation, and could have repercussions across the globe.“It would be psychologically challenging for any trustee of the British Museum to allow the removal of an entire hall of sculptures in one go,” says Alexander Herman, author of Restitution: The Return of Cultural Artefacts. “But there is a definite shift towards museums in Europe and further afield changing their position on repatriation.“It has really gathered pace in the last five years, and other countries with a colonial past, like Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, are all moving forward with this.”As Johnson told Mitsotakis this week, the British Museum and the Government do not believe the Elgin Marbles should be part of that trend.The Elgin Marbles, carved under the supervision of the master sculptor Pheidias between 447 and 432BC, consist of 247ft (75m) of a frieze that ran all the way around the Parthenon, together with 17 figures of the gods and legendary figures from the pediments at either end of the building, and 15 metopes, or relief panels, from above the columns.The centuries-old row over the Elgin Marbles ides into a legal argument and a moral one. On the issue of legal ownership, the British Museum’s position is that in 1801 Lord Elgin was granted permission by the Ottomans, who ruled Greece at the time, to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon, a building the regime did not value (it was even used as a munitions store, leading to huge damage when an Italian cannonball hit it in 1687). The Museum claims a permit, known as a firmin, proves this, and that his actions were “thoroughly investigated” by Parliament in 1816, which found he had acted legally. Elgin’s defenders also say he believed the Marbles were in danger of being lost forever at a time of war, and saved them for posterity (though it is also true that he originally intended to use them to decorate his home in Scotland, before financial troubles forced their sale to the nation).The Greeks, though, say the firmin is a forgery, and a poor one at that, making the claim to ownership invalid. It is this dispute over ownership that stands at the heart of the diplomatic impasse: the Museum is prepared to loan the sculptures to Greece, but Mitsotakis insists the Museum cannot loan objects it does not own, and will only settle for a permanent, no-strings return.Then there is the moral aspect. The Greeks, who defeated the Ottomans with Britain’s help in a war of independence 16 years after Elgin had finished his removal job, regarded their hated Turkish neighbours as an occupying force who had no right to give the Marbles away (even if the firmin was genuine). Mitsotakis’s claim that they were “stolen” is only part of his argument. Why, he says, would an ally of Greece refuse to return one half of a national monument – and one of the world’s great architectural treasures – when it can only be appreciated as a whole?British visitors to the Acropolis Museum, opened in 2009, are treated to a guilt trip that constantly refers to the missing pieces of the puzzle, with gaps marked “BM”, while an audio-visual display shows how the chest of Poseidon, which is in Athens, would look if it was reunited with the rest of his torso, which is in London.“It just keeps trotting out the same mantra it has clung to for the past 200 years. It’s terribly impolite for them to just stay silent on this.”One of the British Museum’s reasons for keeping the Marbles here is that: “There is a positive advantage and public benefit in having the sculptures ided between two great museums,” because in Athens they can be seen “against the backdrop of Athenian history” and in London visitors “can gain insight into how ancient Greece influenced... other civilisations”.Suzman says: “This is just childish, finders keepers stuff. They were brought here, they excited the western world and classical scholarship went up. They have done their job and it’s time for them to go home. It is a moral obligation.“Anyone who goes to the museum in Athens can see that that is where they should be. In the British Museum they are in gloomy rooms on grey plinths and it’s quite a depressing experience.”Suzman’s committee was formed in 1983, inspired by a campaign by the then Greek culture minister, the actress Melina Mercouri. Three years later Mercouri was invited to Oxford University to speak before a debate titled The Elgin Marbles must be returned to Athens.The president of the Oxford Union debating society who invited her to speak was Boris Johnson. Mitsotakis mistakenly believes this means Johnson was an advocate of their return when he was a student, but others who took part in the debate have told The  that Johnson did not speak in it, and he in fact wrote an article for a student magazine arguing that they should stay here.In truth, Johnson has mocked those who say the Marbles should go back, suggesting when he was Mayor of London that George Clooney, the actor and husband of Amal, had lost his own marbles and was pursuing a “Hitlerian agenda”. (Clooney responded by saying Johnson had been guilty of “too much hyperbole washed down with a few whiskies”).Osborne copied Johnson’s jibe about people losing their marbles when, in 2016, he made a similar comment about the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in relation to the sculptures.Yet Mitsotakis, who has the jovial charm of a latter-day Zeus, intends to keep working on Johnson, who regularly stays at his father Stanley’s bolthole at a private olive grove north of Athens.Having failed to persuade Johnson that this year’s 200th anniversary of Greek independence was a good time to make a grand gesture, he told The  he will use the 200th anniversary of the death of Lord Byron to press home his point.Byron was appalled by Elgin’s actions, accusing him of vandalism and looting, and used his satirical poem The Curse of Minerva to denounce him and his supporters.Mitsotakis also has public opinion on his side. When the polling firm YouGov asked people in the UK in 2018 where the Marbles belonged, 56 per cent said Greece, with only 20 per cent believing they should stay in Britain – a significant increase on earlier polls.On the wider issue of returning artefacts to their country of origin, 62 per cent were in favour in a poll carried out earlier this year, with only 15 per cent against.Letters to the editor of The  on the subject this week have been marginally in favour of returning the sculptures.Unesco is also putting pressure on Britain. Unesco’s Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property last month urged the British Museum to revisit the issue, citing, in part, “the poor conditions of exposure that the sculptures are kept in at the British Museum”. Mitsotakis pointed out that the gallery that houses them has still not reopened post-lockdown because of a leaky roof.Crucially, Unesco also suggested that the destiny of the Marbles was an issue that should involve the Government, undermining Johnson’s ready-made excuse that ministers cannot get involved in the issue because the Marbles are owned by the British Museum. In turn, the British Museum says it cannot give the Marbles back because it would be in contravention of the British Museum Act 1963 – a Catch-22 situation that suits both parties.Damian Green, the former first secretary of state and now a member of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, is among those who believes the Marbles should stay.He says: “I have always taken the view that they are well looked after in this country, so if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.“If a valuable object that people can learn from and be inspired by is well preserved and can be seen by millions of people then leave it there.”He is also concerned about opening what the Greeks might call a Pandora’s Box if the Marbles were to be returned.“If you start saying that historic artefacts should all be returned to their place of creation, the western world’s museums and art galleries are going to be pretty vacant and I’m not sure it’s possible to create a coherent policy of what should be where.“Should the Mona Lisa go back to Italy? Are you going to break up the Crown? It’s got a lot of jewels on it from other countries but you would have to destroy the object to return them. Practicalities need to be considered.”Herman does not believe the “thin end of the wedge” argument holds water. He points out that there have been few requests for the return of objects to their place of origin, with even the Rosetta Stone, perhaps the British Museum’s most famous treasure, attracting no formal bids from the Egyptians. Hardline restitutionists make the argument that even if the British Museum did have to return large numbers of items, it has deep reserves, with seven million objects in its archives, as opposed to one million on display.Aside from objects that may or may not have been looted by the Nazis, The British Museum lists six objects or groups of objects in its possession that are “contested”.They are a wooden shield from Australia two stone Moai sculptures from Easter Island the Benin Bronzes the Elgin Marbles human remains and the Maqdala collection of 80 objects from northern Ethiopia.In the case of the Benin Bronzes, taken from the kingdom’s royal palace by the British in 1897, it has reached an agreement with other museums around the world that it will loan parts of its collection to Nigeria on a rotating basis once a purpose-built museum has been completed in Benin City.Human remains are a fascinating sub-category in themselves: the British Museum houses the remains of 6,000 people (only half the number that are in the Natural History Museum) and a small number have been returned to Tasmania and New Zealand after protests by First Nation peoples.Even displaying human remains is now contentious. In Oxford the Pitt Rivers Museum recently removed from display one of its most popular exhibits, its collection of Shuar Tsantsas, or shrunken heads, which are considered sacred to the Shuar people of Ecuador. An “ethical review” carried out during the museum’s Covid-enforced closure led to the removal of 120 sets of human remains, including South Asian Naga trophy heads and the mummified remains of an Egyptian child. Gawping at mummies may soon be an endangered pastime.A major catalyst for the current rush to restitution was a speech made by President Emmanuel Macron in Ouagadougou in 2017, when he raised the bar by saying: “I cannot accept that a large share of several African countries’ cultural heritage be kept in France. There are historical explanations for it, but there is no valid, lasting and unconditional justification.”Needless to say, French bureaucracy has got in the way of his vision, as new laws must be passed to allow objects to leave, but his words resonated in the art world and emboldened African nations to demand returns. The University of Aberdeen and Jesus College, Cambridge are among the institutions that have recently returned bronzes to Nigeria.There is, it must be said, a certain degree of hypocrisy at play in Macron’s grandstanding. The Louvre has not so far offered to return its own Parthenon Sculptures, which include one of the few heads of statues from the pediments. Denmark, too, has fragments of the sculptures in its collections.While the Germans have agreed to return Benin Bronzes, they have not made any moves towards returning the Nefertiti bust, which has been claimed by Egypt since 1924, shortly after its discovery by German archaeologists.Could the British Museum and others be missing a trick by refusing to return objects? Mitsotakis has promised to loan priceless items that have never before left Greece to the British Museum if the Elgin Marbles are returned. Herman suggests historians would go “weak at the knees” at the prospect of Agamemnon’s pure gold death mask being displayed in London, and visitor numbers could increase if the public is enticed to make return visits whenever something shiny and new is on display.There is another upside to loan deals: while the British Museum is not allowed to charge for general admission, it can charge for entry to temporary exhibitions of loaned artefacts. And that is the sort of argument that even George Osborne would understand.More from NewsWe need a sense of proportion about the problems facing womenTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes takes the stand in her own criminal fraud trialDutch police open fire on anti-lockdown rioters amid \u0026#39orgy of violence\u0026#39It’s school shoes, not the uniform, that cost an arm and a legPictured: Teenage ballerina dances on one of world’s first custom-made \u0026#39en pointe\u0026#39 prosthetic legWet wipes and ketchup sachets could be banned in government crackdown on single-use plasticMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictured redmaids high schoolgirls walk bristol tradition dating","story":"Girls from Redmaids\u0027 High in Bristol marked the founding of their school with a return to a grand tradition dating back to 1634. Led by the school\u0027s Head Girls over 700 students aged seven to 18 walked through Bristol for a special service. The school\u0027s annual Founders\u0027 Commemoration Day dates back hundreds of years, and attracts people back to Bristol from across the country as alumnae, parents and members of the public line the route to watch the spectacle.Redmaids\u0027 said in a statement: This is an extremely important day for us as we gather to celebrate the heritage of Redmaids’ High School, and remember our founding fathers who were progressive enough to pledge money for the education of Bristol’s young women.Reverends T G Rose and Urijah Thomas opened Redland High School in 1882 and John Whitson founded The Red Maids’ School in 1634. When Redmaids’ High School was formed in 2016, it brought the schools together to combine over 500 years of expertise.Each November, the day starts with a memorial service in St Nicholas Crypt when the Head Girl, accompanied by Sixth Form students and members of the School Council, lays a wreath on the tomb of John Whitson.Then more than 900 students and members of staff walk in line from the Welsh Back to Bristol Cathedral for a special service.  More from NewsWe need a sense of proportion about the problems facing womenTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes takes the stand in her own criminal fraud trialDutch police open fire on anti-lockdown rioters amid \u0026#39orgy of violence\u0026#39It’s school shoes, not the uniform, that cost an arm and a legPictured: Teenage ballerina dances on one of world’s first custom-made \u0026#39en pointe\u0026#39 prosthetic legWet wipes and ketchup sachets could be banned in government crackdown on single-use plasticMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia paying close attention hms queen elizabeth race salvage","story":"The RAF\u0027s crashed F-35 jet went down soon after take off, it has emerged as the race to recover the aircraft continues. Defence sources confirmed that since Wednesday’s crash, which saw the Carrier Strike Group lose one of the Royal Air Force’s eight F-35b stealth fast jets, Russia had been paying close attention to the incident.There are concerns about the need to protect the sensitive information contained in the £100 million jet, which are considered the most complex and secretive aircraft that the UK possesses.“The Russians haven’t taken their eyes off the carrier while it’s been in the Eastern Med,” the source said. “Recovering the jet is the top priority to stop if falling into the wrong hands.”It is believed that the jet plunged into the sea close to the ship when it crashed on Wednesday morning shortly after 10am.The pilot ejected and was safely rescued, and has since been taken to hospital for a routine medical check-up in Greece.In order to get the pilot to hospital, HMS Queen Elizabeth had to ert from her planned route so that the pilot could be flown off the ship.In order for the pilot to be removed from the aircraft carrier, she had to sail closer to land so that a helicopter could meet her at sea.Due to the change of course, the Prince of Wales was on Friday forced to cancel a planned visit to the aircraft carrier. He had been due to visit the ship from Egypt.However, despite the fact that it is thought the aircraft landed near the carrier, some have suggested a plane will “fly” underwater in a similar way to being in air, meaning that the jet would have travelled a significant distance after crashing.Given that the aircraft went down in about 1.24 miles of water, it is likely the search area on the sea bed will be a circle of about four miles diameter.The  understands that the F-35 has not yet been located, but Royal Navy ships are remaining in the area to deter anyone else trying to recover the jet.Provided that the jet’s black box was not damaged in the crash, it will be signalling.The Navy will send down a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to be directed onto the wreckage by this signal.The ROV will attach flotation devices, which can be filled with compressed gas. These are effectively “open-sided” balloons open to allow the expansion of gases as the wreckage ascends to the surface.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) will first be working to locate the jet. Afterwards, it has to decide whether to recover the aircraft, or any pieces if it has broken up.The technology exists for such a recovery, even given the depth of water. The US has considerable experience of this, having suffered a number of “ditchings” from aircraft carriers.If a recovery operation is launched, a dedicated salvage platform will need to be located and contracted for the task, given that the MoD does not own such equipment.However, it is not known how long any salvage operation will take. It will not be swift and will be dictated by the location of any salvage platform.However, while the UK is aware that Russia is watching, on Friday night Navy sources sought to play down the threat, insisting that Russian Kilo-Class submarines that could be used to search for the jet are located in the Black Sea and are not capable of ing to 1.24 miles.The MoD does not comment or speculate on matters that could affect operational security, but it is thought likely the swift recovery of the aircraft will be a priority.Britain will likely call on allies to support the logistics of any salvage operation.More from NewsWe need a sense of proportion about the problems facing womenTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes takes the stand in her own criminal fraud trialDutch police open fire on anti-lockdown rioters amid \u0026#39orgy of violence\u0026#39It’s school shoes, not the uniform, that cost an arm and a legPictured: Teenage ballerina dances on one of world’s first custom-made \u0026#39en pointe\u0026#39 prosthetic legWet wipes and ketchup sachets could be banned in government crackdown on single-use plasticMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"womans hour presenter could frontrunner search andrew marrs","story":"The role of the BBC’s leading political interviewer is up for grabs after Andrew Marr announced he was quitting the corporation for a move to commercial radio.Marr will leave his flagship Sunday morning show after 16 years. His decision took many colleagues by surprise, and will see some of the BBC’s most prominent names jostling to replace him.The merry-go-round is likely to affect the line-up of Radio 4’s Today programme and BBC Two’s Newsnight as the BBC reshuffles its roster.Emma Barnett, presenter of Newsnight and Woman’s Hour, is a leading contender to succeed Marr. She impressed bosses when she stood in for Marr in 2018 while he was being treated for cancer.Laura Kuenssberg is said to be negotiating her exit as political editor. A move to the Today programme had been mooted, but the Marr job could also appeal.If Kuenssberg did join Today, Nick Robinson could move to the Sunday television slot and take Marr’s place.Emily Maitlis, who conducted the award-winning interview with Prince Andrew, is also a contender.Other names in the frame include Jo Coburn, presenter of the daily Politics Live show Victoria Derbyshire, whose self-titled show was controversially cancelled last year Amol Rajan, the BBC’s media editor and Today presenter and Fiona Bruce, host of Question Time.Coral, the bookmaker, made Zeinab Badawi the surprise 21 favourite. The BBC World News and former Channel 4 presenter has stood in for Marr in the past.But Marr’s departure could also open the way for Andrew Neil to make his BBC return.Neil quit the broadcaster to launch GB News, a move that proved ill-fated. Asked this week if he would rejoin the BBC, Neil said: “I have no idea. I would like to do something on the TV front – count this as a job application – because I don’t want GB News to be the full-stop in my broadcasting career.”Marr, 62, is leaving his £340,000 BBC job to join Global radio, where he will present an “opinion-led” show on LBC and another programme on Classic FM. Both will feature political interviews.The veteran presenter previously expressed his unhappiness with the BBC’s strict impartiality rules, saying it was “very frustrating” that he could not speak his mind on political issues.Announcing his decision on Friday, Marr said: “After 21 years, I have decided to move on from the BBC. I leave behind many happy memories and wonderful colleagues. But from the New Year, I am moving to Global to write and present political and cultural shows, and to write for newspapers.“I think British politics and public life are going to go through an even more turbulent decade, and as I’ve said, I am keen to get my own voice back.“I have been doing the Andrew Marr show every Sunday morning for 16 years now and that is probably more than enough time for anybody.”Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, praised Marr as “a fantastic presenter and interviewer, whose wisdom and skill will be a loss to our screens”.Tim Davie, the director-general, said: “Andrew Marr has been a brilliant journalist and presenter during his time at the BBC.

After the show, I noticed another couple – smartly dressed in their mid-50s – filling out a feedback form. Possessing excellent eyesight and a journalist’s inherent nosiness, I peered over at their form. They said they were visiting from Harrogate and loved the cinema before adding: “It’s just a shame it is in Bradford”.That is the outside perception which has long dogged Britain’s seventh-biggest city. Arguably it is a view shared by some of those in Government conducting the integrated rail review, which was published this week and outlined the future of transport in the north.Bradford had been earmarked for a gleaming new station on the site of a wholesale fruit and veg market, connecting the city with a new high speed line running from east to west. But despite having the worst rail connections of any English city, Bradford has once more been overlooked. The only scant solace offered to us Bradfordians under the new rail plans is that we will be able to reach our glitzy neighbour Leeds quicker than before – as if we should somehow be thankful for the opportunity to leave.For whatever reason, parts of the outside world still view Bradford as this awful place and somehow we remain this forgotten city. Maybe the shadow of Leeds really is that big? Maybe the outside world only remembers the race riots of 2001, or never looks beyond the terrible ring roads designed by 1960s town planners?But this is a city with an extraordinary heritage. The Brontës, David Hockney, JB Priestley and – to give a few more recent cultural phenomenons – the popstars Zayn Malik and Kimberley Walsh all called Bradford home. While recent decades have been shaped by industrial decline, Bradford is an increasingly dynamic place. We are the youngest city in Britain with 26.3 per cent of the population under the age of 18. Some people think the multiculturalism we have here is a weakness, but a lot of us see it as a strength.The Bradfordian character is defined by a combination of so many things. But I like to think of it as that Yorkshire spirit, infused with added Masala.I was born here in 1977 to a mixed race family which at the time was a rarity in itself. My mother was English, the daughter of a pub landlord, and my dad had come over when he was about nine from Bangladesh. They both did all manner of jobs however, when I was growing up he worked as a bus driver.We actually lived in Keighley (within the Bradford district but outside the city itself) but my dad’s side of the family all lived around the Bradford City Football Stadium so we were always visiting.There is a famous curry house nearby called the Sweet Centre (which is still in operation today) on a back street off Lumb Lane. Some of my earliest memories are sitting at the counter with my dad, eating the traditional Asian breakfast of chana puri. Opposite the curry house was one of the dark satanic mills which made Bradford this incredibly rich city during the 19th century when the textile trade boomed.As a child we used to go to another one of those mills – many of which were shuttered in the post-war era – which had been transformed into a flea market. I used to buy badges to sew on my jumpers there. The bright colours of my auntie’s saris fluttering against the soot-stained Yorkshire stone of these buildings still sticks in my mind.Aged 11, I was awarded a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School after an inspirational headteacher at my local primary signed me up for the exams. The school has an alumni that includes Alistair Campbell and early on in my time there I remember getting involved with drama and being cast in a few plays at the school’s Hockney theatre.We studied the plays of J.B Priestley and Keith Waterhouse (from nearby Leeds). On weekends we used to go and play at the moors above Haworth where the Brontës lived. Growing up I had everything I needed on my doorstep. It was only when I got into the industry later in life that I became aware of the London-centric nature of the arts.On Wednesday afternoons we used to finish school early – ostensibly to play sports but I always went to the cinema. Later in my teens I started to get a different sense of Bradford as definitely a bit dangerous. Certainly we didn’t want to wear our brown school blazers around town.There was also a sense of a wider decline gripping the city. The closure of the Bradford Odeon in 2000 was a massive moment for me – it felt like a statement being made about the culture of the city. Similarly the building site of the abandoned Westfield Shopping Centre (construction of which collapsed during the financial crisis) was another all-too visible scar.The rail announcement this week has been so difficult for a lot of people to swallow because in recent years Bradford has started to fulfil its potential. The hole in the ground has been finally filled in with a new shopping centre. In the absence of major funding, a DIY punk spirit has infused the city and it’s been really interesting to watch.A lot of stuff has been happening under the radar and there are some amazing local theatre groups like Common Wealth and Theatre in the Mill, new artists studios, beat poets and rappers. Both my wife and I work in the arts, me as a playwright, her as a dancer creating work with international festivals – and we do it from Bradford. We don’t see any reason to leave, no pull away from the city to pursue our careers in culture elsewhere.Alongside that DIY spirit we have the National Media Museum and the incredible Alhambra Theatre that can host really big events. Last month Bradford’s bid to be the UK’s city of culture in 2025 was longlisted. Add to that, splendid Victorian architecture, landscaped city parks, and the most beautiful Waterstones book store in the country, as well as the finest curry in Britain and there are exciting times ahead of us.In the past, Bradford might have rolled over when bad news like the integrated rail plan was announced, and accepted it as just another example of Bradford being forgotten, playing second fiddle to Leeds and condemned as some industrial throwback.This time there seems to be a sense in Bradford that this may be a setback, but it doesn’t have to mean a step backwards for the city.As told to Joe ShuteMore from NewsWe need a sense of proportion about the problems facing womenTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes takes the stand in her own criminal fraud trialDutch police open fire on anti-lockdown rioters amid \u0026#39orgy of violence\u0026#39It’s school shoes, not the uniform, that cost an arm and a legPictured: Teenage ballerina dances on one of world’s first custom-made \u0026#39en pointe\u0026#39 prosthetic legWet wipes and ketchup sachets could be banned in government crackdown on single-use plasticMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saturday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph2","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Saturday.

The European Movement will funnel tens of thousands of pounds into targeting  MPs who back the UK-Australia trade deal, which looks set to undercut British farmers and lower food standards. The money will fund a string of aposaggressive campaign adsapos, as the Movement aims to apospick offapos Conservative MPs, mainly in the South, to pile pressure on the government to change course.MPs targeted include Deputy PM Dominic Raab, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and high-profile Tory Jeremy Hunt. Activists from the cross-party pressure group will focus on three areas they think could sway voters: animal welfare, environment and food standards, like chlorinated chicken.One ad to be targeted at voters in senior Tory Liam Foxaposs North Somerset reads: aposSkinning lambs alive is cruel and shouldnapost be allowed anywhere near the UK market. Tell your Tory MP Liam Fox to fight for animal welfare standards” alongside images of fearful-looking animals.Another, apparently ripping off KFC branding, reads: aposHow do you like your chicken  Roast. Fried. Chlorinated.aposThe fresh attack comes as Boris Johnsonaposs Tories have fallen behind Labour in the polls after two weeks of sleaze allegations following the Owen Paterson row. aposBlue Wallapos Conservatives have also been spooked after the shock by-election result in Chesham and Amersham, which saw the Liberal Democrats overturn a ,-vote Tory majority in June. The European Movement has carried out exclusive polling which suggests a majority would back an outright ban on imported food that doesn’t meet British standards. Insiders have told the Mirror that the group believesit can convince one in ten of Tory voters in their target seats to switch vote, scores of Tory MPs could be aposunder threatapos. Labour peer Lord Andrew Adonis, who is chair of the European Movement and previously served as a minister during the Blair and Brown New Labour years, said: “Voters deserve to know when their Tory MP is backing a bad deal that critically undermines traditional British values. “So, we are putting Tory MPs on notice: Stand up for what your constituents believe in or be sure that we will let them know you let them down. “ Boris Johnson ’s Brexit is already causing empty shelves, empty pumps and empty pockets.He knows this Brexit isn’t working but his desperation to get a trade deal over the line at any cost is costing him the Blue Wall. “The British public is clear: Back British farmers, keep chlorine out of our food and stop slashing standards.” While the two upcoming by-election seats of North Shropshire and Old Bexley and Sidcup are not on the list, the two ballot box tests will be a headache for Mr Johnson as the governing party falls behind. Northerners are also levelling claims of betrayal at the Government over the integrated rail plan, which contains £bn less funding than was originally billed.

Yet Boris Johnson claims it’s “total rubbish” to say promises have been broken. We show why that’s flagrantly untrueBoris Johnson onboard a train from Wolverhampton to Coventry yesterday - after he had his rail plans sent to Coventry as well Image: Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Nov We’ve had four Tory-led governments since , and all of them have made bold claims about rail to the North.But yesterday Boris Johnson shattered those pledges, scrapping a key part of HS and downgrading Northern Powerhouse Rail. The HS eastern leg will no longer run to Leeds while only a section of NPR will be new high-speed track, from Warrington to Marsden. And hopes of high-speed stations in Bradford and, once upon a time, Sheffield have all been ditched. Labour said the Tories have “recommitted and re-promised” a northern rail revolution  times since . And Keir Starmer said voters are starting to “see the Prime Minister for what he really is,” adding: “He’s a Prime Minister who thinks he can make promises and then break them and there’ll be no consequences.” Sure enough, Boris Johnson is trying to convince voters he’s an honest Joe - claiming it’s “total rubbish” to say he’s broken his promises. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps took it even further today, bizarrely moaning that complaints are from “largely Labour leaders who are completely misleading people”. This is, of course, not true - Tory MP for Keighley Robbie Moore said the plan completely short-changed his constituents while Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: “It’s a white elephant missing a leg”. And Conservative chairman of the Commons Transport Committee, Huw Merriman, put the focus on broken promises saying: This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and leaving the others to explain the arrival of moonlight.”  So what exactly did the Tories promise on HS and NPR  Here are  of the most egregious examples of pledges that have since been smashed.  October : Tory ministers propose a Y-shaped HS line via Birmingham to Manchester in the West and Leeds in the East. In the East, the line would stop in Sheffield Meadowhall and there would be a high-speed linking line to York. Phase One to Birmingham is set to open in , with Phase Two in  on an initial £.bn budget. The reality now: No HS stops in Leeds or Sheffield Phase One is now scheduled for “around ” and the surviving legs to Manchester and East Midlands Parkway are scheduled for the “early to mid s”.  October : PM David Cameron and George Osborne give their backing to ‘HS’ - “a high speed rail link connecting the north’s great cities which could signicantly reduce journey times across the region”. This later is named Northern Powerhouse Rail, linking Manchester to Leeds and possibly going further. The reality now: There will be no high-speed intercity link in NPR, only a high-speed section between Warrington, Manchester, and Marsden. The majority of NPR will be on upgraded existing track, saving £bn.  November : Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin declares: “We are already looking at HS. An east-west line joining up the great cities of the north. From Liverpool to Hull.” The reality now: Northern Powerhouse Rail is mostly not high-speed track, and will not run to Hull - it will stop in York. June : After David Cameron wins a majority, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin goes to Leeds and says: “The argument has been won. HS will be built, the full ‘Y’ network, from London to Birmingham and Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds, with construction starting in just  years.” The reality now: There will be no leg to Leeds. Construction on the eastern leg to East Midlands Parkway will only begin in the late s. November : The government unveils updated HS plans. They will still build a Y-shaped line, including the Eastern leg to Leeds - although Sheffield will be left off the proposed route, sparking fury. A document says “HS will have a transformational effect on journey times, with journeys between Leeds and Birmingham taking just  minutes, compared to  hour  minutes currently, and between Leeds and London taking  hour  minutes.” The reality now: Leeds leg has been dropped and the plan is for Leeds-Birmingham to take  hour  minutes and Leeds-London to take  hour  minutes.  April : After taking over from David Cameron as PM, Theresa May announces: “We remain absolutely committed to HS. It is a very important infrastructure project for the country. It is important that we increase capacity on this mainline and I believe that HS is the right way to do that.” The reality now: HS has been cut back and capacity to Leeds will be hit as a result. January : Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says: “We must keep on making the strategic case for HS and work hard to win over the public about its potential benefits. Let me reiterate. We are committed to a second stage between the West Midlands and Leeds and between Crewe and Manchester, completing the ‘Y axis’.” The reality now: The Y axis will not be complete. July : Boris Johnson takes over from Theresa May after triumphing with Tory members. He says days after entering office: “I want to be the Prime Minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London. And today I am going to deliver on my commitment to that vision with a pledge to fund the Leeds to Manchester route.” The reality now: There will be a Leeds to Manchester route but only about half of it will be on high-speed track. December : The Tories win a manesto based on the pledge: We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.” It’s notable that the manesto does not pledge HS in full, instead promising to review the line. The reality now: While Tories insist they are building NPR it is not the high-speed line they envisaged. Birmingham to Newcastle will take  minutes longer than originally planned.  February : Boris Johnson says HS has green light despite doubts. While he only commits to the line extending as far as Birmingham, with further lines to Manchester and Leeds up for review, he adds: “This is about finally making a rapid connection from the West Midlands to the northern powerhouse - to Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds - and simultaneously permitting us to go forward with northern powerhouse rail across the Pennines, finally giving the home of the railways the fast connections they need. None of that makes any sense without HS.” The reality now: HS will only link up to NPR in Manchester, not in Leeds. February : Transport Minister Andrew Stephenson promises NPR will be a “new rail link”. He says: “We need to build new capacity. New rail links north to south, and east to west. That’s why we’re going ahead with both HS and Northern Powerhouse Rail. These are not ‘either or’ projects. They are both crucial to our future prosperity.” The reality now: NPR will mostly run on existing track, not be a new link.  February : Despite raising doubts over HS plans and ordering a review, Boris Johnson tells the Commons: “I can certainly confirm that we are going to develop the eastern leg as well as the whole of HS.” By now the expected budget has soared beyond £bn. The reality now: The government as done the exact opposite of what the PM promised. May : Transport Secretary Grant Shapps promises full-fat HS but perhaps a semi-skimmed NPR: We are going to complete HS and include HS on the eastern leg to Leeds. The only question that we have is how to better integrate that with plans which have developed a very long way since HS was first dreamt up all those decades ago. That particularly pertains to the northern powerhouse rail. The reality now: Both HS AND NPR have been downgraded.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Patrick McLoughlinTheresa MayGrant ShappsBoris JohnsonDavid CameronGeorge OsborneChris GraylingEdward LeighLabour PartyConservative PartyRailwaysPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He was admitted to hospital with Covid- less than a month before the  presidential election but conflicting statements were given over the severity of his illness.

He added: “We lost very badly in , and my job as leader of the Labour Party has been to change our party, turn it round.” The party chief was asked the pointed question by BBC interviewer Justin Webb after he blasted Boris Johnson for “blowing away” his own pledges on rail for the north.Sir Keir insisted he could “feel a real change in the last two to three weeks” in the public mood, “where people are beginning I think to see the Prime Minister for what he really is.” He added: “He’s a man who has never thought the rules apply to him and his mates - so it’s one rule for him and his mates, another for everybody , and you saw that in the Paterson affair.  “He’s a Prime Minister who thinks he can make promises and then break them and there’ll be no consequences.” But questioned about his predecessor by BBC Radio ’s Today programme, Labour’s leader was more careful in his language.Askedhe was still convinced Jeremy Corbyn would have been a better Prime Minister, he replied: “Well look, the public gave us our verdict on that argument pretty strongly in . We lost.”Asked a second time, he said: “A Labour government would be far better than the government we’ve got.”  Asked a third time, he said: “What I’ve been doing is I’ve recognised the scale of what’s happened.” Asked a fourth time, he replied: “Well look, what have we got in the Prime Minister  We’ve got a Prime Minister who has…” Asked why he would not answer the question, he replied: “A Labour government is always better than a Conservative government”. Askedthat meant Jeremy Corbyn would have been better than Boris Johnson, he replied: “We lost very badly in , and my job as leader of the Labour Party has been to change our party, turn it round, and that’s what we’ve been doing. “I appreciate the rule changes we had at conference are boring process, but they don’t have show we’ve changed the Labour Party and set out a positive case for the future. “But also to draw a distinction between my instincts and the instincts of the Prime Minister, I think that by and large in Britain, people believe we should play by the rules, get on by playing by the rules, and you don’t rip up the rules just to protect a mate.” Sir Keir also defended calling for a ban on MPs earning money from legal work - despite earning more than £, in that way himself. He said: “If you look at standards over many years in Parliament there are points at which we move forward and change the rules. And I think this is one of those points.“It’s not to judge anybody who’s acted in accordance with the rules in the past.” He added: “I actually gave up my legal practicing certicate nearly two years ago now, so I haven’t been able to nor have I given legal advice for the best part of two years. “Some of the payments I’ve had recently go back a number of years, including for work before I became an MP.”  It came as Sir Keir said the Government has “blown away” its levelling up plans by leaving the North and Midlands with second-class rail links. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the High Speed eastern leg to Leeds had been ditched, and plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail were downgraded. Mr Shapps denied the Government has reneged on rail promises for the region and accused Sir Keir of “misleading people”. But the Labour leader told BBC Radio : “The Government has ripped up those promises and betrayed people in the North. I was in Bradford yesterday and the anger is palpable. People feel very strongly that promises have been made to them and they have just been ripped up. “The idea that ‘levelling up’ is anything more than a slogan has absolutely blown away by what happened yesterday. “The whole point of HS was a high speed line going up including to Leeds. The whole point of the promise of Northern Powerhouse Rail was a new line going from Manchester to Leeds. Trying to upgrade what you have got is a second-class option for the North.” Mr Johnson pledged the full HS line as recently as February. And the  Tory manesto said: We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester. But the plans were dropped on Thursday with fears they could have cost up to £billion. Instead of HS to Leeds, there will be a high speed line from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, near Nottingham. The western HS track from Crewe to Manchester, will go ahead. Mr Shapps told Sky News: “When it comes to HS, we are going to deliver HS trainsthe best way to do that into Leeds. The plan for HS was conceived  years ago. “What we want to do is make sure it actually integrates with these plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail which we are building. “The only disconnect is some of the complaints from, I have to say, largely Labour leaders who are completely misleading people.” Several of the complaints have come from Tory politicians.

It is said the Home Secretary had been impressed with centres being built in Greece, where migrants were put under strict curfews and faced routine checks on their movements. Ms Patel had reportedly praised the “very dferent” approach taken by Greece in the face of the migrant crisis, including the digitisation of the asylum process in order to speed it up and save on paperwork. More than , people have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel in small boats – almost three times as many last year. A UK government source was quoted by Theas saying thatmigrants breached the rules under the new plans, their asylum claim could be impacted. But it comes as The Times reported Boris Johnson had drafted in Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Steve Barclay to oversee the rising number of migrants arriving on Britain’s shores.The Times reported that the PM was “exasperated” with the issue following a number of strategies to stem the flow. Some previously reported plans including the use giant wave machines to prevent migrant crossings, nets to snare boat propellers, and floating walls in the sea, were “never considered”, Dan O’Mahoney, the Home Office’s Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, told the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week, adding on the wave machine idea: “I think it’s a bizarre idea.”  And he described a number of the ideas that made their way into the headlines as “fancul”. But the move to bring in Mr Barclay could be seen as an admission that the Home Secretary has not managed to tackle the issue.It comes after Sir Keir Starmer accused Ms Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel. The Labour leader said Ms Patel has not secured strong enough agreements with the French government to prevent migrants making the dangerous sea journey.He said the Home Secretary repeatedly used “strong language” to say how she would tackle the problem, but delivered “absolutely nothing”. His attack came as Ms Patel blamed the EU’s open borders – established by the Schengen Agreement – for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was “constantly pressing” the French on the issue, but that they were “overwhelmed”. “Let’s not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – Schengen open borders,” she was quoted as saying. More than , people have arrived in the UK so far this year after making the Channel crossing in small boats – almost three times the number there were in . This includes at least , who arrived since Monday, according to data compiled by the PA news agency. This number is set to rise as the exact figure for Tuesday is still being finalised by the Home Office.  It is thought at least  migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing. It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British “oscillate between partnership and provocation” when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: “We need to further strengthen collaboration.” Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensied recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where canisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants. Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work “extremely closely” with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe. “We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings,” a No  spokesman said. “This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions.” Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britain’s “busted” asylum system. Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a “dysal” system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in . Sir Keir said: “My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted.  “This Government has been in power for  years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch. “Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at. “Sothe asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.” Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador to Britain flatly denied reports his country has been in discussions with the Government about hosting a processing centre for migrants who arrive in the UK. Qirjako Qirko told LBC radio that there had been “zero talks” between the two countries on the issue. “It’s absolutely fake news because as my prime minister stated yesterday – the foreign minister also tweeted yesterday – that doesn’t exist, any negotiations between Albania and the UK regarding these processing centres,” he said. “It will not be changed because my prime minister was crystal clear yesterday when he said that Albania… will never be a processing centre for illegal immigrants.” Comment MORE ON ImmigrationPriti PatelBoris JohnsonMigrant crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Days after the terrorism threat level was raised, Ms Patel said supporters of the group could face up to  years in prison. Hamasapos militant wing was proscribed as a terrorist group in March  but its political arm was not covered by the ban. Actions expected to be outlawed from November  would include arranging meetings for the group, flying their flag or wearing clothing that it is seen to support them. Speaking at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, Ms Patel said: Hamas has signicant terrorist capability, including access to extensive and sophisticated weaponry as well as terrorist training facilities, and it has long been involved in signicant terrorist violence.  Hamas commits, participates, prepares for and promotes and encourages terrorism. If we tolerate extremism, it will erode the rock of security. She highlighted it is an important step to protect the Jewish community and described the group as fundamentally and rabidly Anti-semitic. Ms Patel said: Antisemitism is an enduring evil which I will never tolerate. Jewish people routinely feel unsafe - at school, in the streets, when they worship, in their homes, and online. This step will strengthen the case against anyone who waves a Hamas flag in the United Kingdom, an act that is bound to make Jewish people feel unsafe. The move will be debated in Parliament next week and could come into force before the end of the month. In a statement, Hamas said: Unfortunately, the UK continues with its aggression against the Palestinian people. The UK Government should have apologised for its historic sin against the Palestinian people in the shameless Balfour Declaration and the British mandate that handed Palestine to the Israeli occupation. Now, the UK Government sides with the aggressor against the victim. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss expressed her support for the move, tweeting: “Hamas will be proscribed as a terrorist organisation. Important announcement by [Priti Patel] that will help tackle the scourge of antisemitism.” The UK’s terrorism threat level has been raised after two attacks in the space of a month. It is now listed as “severe”, which means an attack is “highly likely”.

Well, now we know the answer. Tory sleaze is back and it’s bigger than ever. The truth is that this Prime Minister has never been far from the stench of corruption but it was the case of the Westferry cash-for-favours scandal that brought Tory sleaze back to the fore. Last year, the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick unlawfully took a decision that helped a Tory donor dodge tens of millions of pounds in tax, approving a billion-pound planning application against the advice of his civil servants. Conservative Ministers this week decided, at long last, to refuse the application, which would have blighted Tower Hamlets and given the borough only a fraction of the affordable housing needed in exchange.Westferry set the tone that has so riled the public: just like the Paterson affair, the Prime Minister didn’t like the rules, so he ripped them up - blocking the Cabinet Secretary from determining whether Jenrick had broken the Ministerial Code. It was one of many examples of the PM acting to enable corruption - and expecting the public to wear it. “Nothing to see here”. Except there was plenty to see – and to cover up. When Labour forced the Conservatives to publish a cache of embarrassingly cosy texts between Jenrick and Richard Desmond, the billionaire property developer behind the development, it showed just why the Government was so keen to cover up the scandal. Desmond had lobbied Jenrick at a Tory fundraising dinner. They talked about ramming through his luxury development in East London, to stop giving “Marxists loads of doe ” in community taxation. That was money that would have gone towards building schools, clinics and other community infrastructure that local families and local people rely on. Like everything that has come after, all these cases show why Tory sleaze is so poisonous, because the public always ends up paying the price for corruption.Take the billions in crony contracts that the Conservatives have doled out to their mates and middlemen for PPE that didn’t work, while frontline NHS workers were battling Covid without safe equipment or the £billion Test and Trace system run by the under-qualied partner of a Conservative MP that was so useless that local councils ended up going door-to-door to find infected members of the public. It’s because the PM enables this corruption that sees billions funnelled to Conservative cronies that families and workers are getting clobbered with a National Insurance hike, council tax rises and cuts to Universal Credit to balance the books. Working people are paying so the Conservatives and their mates can profit. Labour will put an end to the Conservatives’ sleazy behaviour. We will set up an independent anti-cronyism commission and ban MPs having paid consultancies so that there can be more cases of MPs putting their interests above those of their constituents. Just as Boris Johnson has form for enabling corruption, Keir Starmer has a track record of tackling it. As DPP he prosecuted expenses cheats– and he’ll stop sleaze in its tracks as Prime Minister.That is the dference between Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer: one covers up for crooks, the other throws the book at them.

Thats who.opinionByLiam GilliverOpinion Writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsThe higher you climb, the harder you fall. Itaposs a perfect proverb to explain the patriarchy: a system designed to benefit men but one that simultaneously backfires on itself. Weaposre told International Menaposs Dayis a response to alarming suicide statistics that disproportionately affect men. According to the Samaritans, males aged - continue to have the highest suicide rate . These numbers are often attributed to the idea that men are unable to open up, that weaposre afraid to talk or address our feelings. We hear this rhetoric about how men are expected to be strong, both physically and mentally, and not show any signs of weakness. And for many, that shoe fits snuggly. But the elephant in the room that no one is willing to acknowledge is the culprit behind this is societal expectation. Who is pressuring men to stay silent when theyaposre suffering  Who is shaming emotional intelligence and authentic expression  Men. Thataposs who.As a male who has always rejected the cultural expectation of masculinity- growing up gay with silver hair in the North - I have only ever experienced prejudice and oppression from fellow men. Women have never villainised my femininity, women have never called me out for showing emotion or dressing dferently. I have never felt intimidated walking into a room of women, or felt threatened by their very existence. Perhaps itaposs because women can empathise with having their femininity laughed at - having their hobbies mocked and their appearance scrutinised - maybe itaposs because they donapost want men to perform their masculinity. But unfortunately, the majority of IMD followers only want a day for themselves to snub women.In , there were about , tweets about IMD - around two-fths of which occurred on International Womenaposs Day , as men punched walls and screeched at their mums: Itaposs not fair . How come women get a day and we donapost Beside its inherent rivalry of IWD - celebrating men is not going to help the suicide epidemic. We need to stop using harrowing figures as a smokescreen to compete against women over who is worse off. What we need is accountability, to put our hands up and admit that weaposre the root of the issue weaposre complaining about. Soyou want to celebrate IMD - go ahead. Butyou ever mock the way that feminine gay guy walks, or sneer at women for simply existing, then know that you are the problem.

Tina Gray, , went through menopause two years ago but was adamant she wasnapost going to give up her sex le with her husband Dez, . The pair made a conscious effort to keep up excitement in the bedroom, making sure their flame didnapost die out. And when Tina felt something in her breast she was unsure about, she wasnapost taking any chances. She was sitting on the sofa watching TV one night without a bra on and felt a hard lump just above her nipple on her left breast. Concerned, she asked Dez to cop a feel of her breast to seeit felt dferent to usual. And he immediately realised something was wrong.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Tina, from Aldershot, said: It was such a huge shock when we found the lump - you do momentarily find yourself facing your own mortality. As soon as Dez felt the lump, he knew something wasnapost right. I trusted his judgement and went straight to a doctor - after all, who would be more familiar with my breasts than my husband  She added that their intense intimacy throughout menopause meant Dez was better placed than ever to knowsomething was dferent. Dez grew very interested in my boobs which has now meant heaposs saved my le, she said.While sheaposs incredibly grateful to both the NHS and Macmillan Cancer Support for treating and helping her while she had cancer, sheaposs especially thankful for Dez who she wants to marry all over again. When Tina first started going through menopause, she found that sex could be uncomfortable or even painful, but she battled through the discomfort. She said: It was like I was going through puberty again but in reverse. I just had to be open with Dez and communicate how I was feeling instead of pushing him away so he could understand what I was going through. Itaposs not that I didnapost want to have sex with him, itaposs just that sometimes I couldnapost because it was uncomfortable or even painful. Weaposre not alone any more, there is plenty of stuff out there that can help couples have a sex le when going through menopause, you just have to look for it! Instead of pushing us apart, it just brought us closer. Our sex le didnapost end, we just had to adjust.Dez added that Tinaaposs change in  coincided with coronavirus lockdowns, leaving the couple with a lot on their plate.It was like aposoh, we donapost need thatapos, he said. We just talked about it, worked through it and itaposs all good now! Reflecting on how he discovered the lump in his weaposs breast, he said: Weaposve been together a long time so Iaposm well versed with the geography of Tinaaposs upper torso.  I was having a rummage, like you do, and felt concerned that there was something unusual in her breast which we felt we needed to have checked out. It was scary, the unknown was frightening. We knew we had to go get it sorted. After a consultation, Tina was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer, with the doctor also picking up a smaller lump in her right breast.

Abigail’s Bridal Boutique in Leeds is at the centre of complaints with upset customers joining a Facebook group to voice their concerns and grievances with the shop. Founded by Lauren Stanley, , a former model who graced the cover of Playboy, Abigail’s Bridal Boutique has left brides in tears and terried they won’t have a dress for their big day. Leanne Slatcher said she ordered her fit and flare dress in  after spotting the perfect outfit for her big day, LeedsLive reports. Have you had any issue with a wedding dress ordered from Abigail’s Bridal Boutique  Email webnews@mirror The -year-old said that her wedding was delayed due to Covid, and when she finally set a date for this year she believed her dress would be the least stressful part of the process. She claims she was ignored by the boutique with weeks to spare, got an unqualied student to do her fitting and said she began to feel ‘stressed’ and ‘worried’her dress would ever be ready. Leanne said when she went to the boutique for her six-week fitting in August, she realised there was going to be a problem as she saw dozens of brides-to-be waiting outside. She claims she was made to wait two hours for her appointment, surrounded by angry and disgruntled women. “There was just chaos outside the shop for hours, and no one knew what was happening, she said. “I was so confused and I just wish they were more transparent about what they were going through.  “The biggest nightmare for me was that the woman who did my fitting didn’t seem to know what she was doing.” Leanne said she was told that the fitting would need to be rescheduled - but claims the shop had deleted their Facebook page which was their point of contact. She added: “I couldn’t afford another dress, so I knew I had to sort something out because the time was running out.” In September, just a month before she was due to get married, Leanne says she still hadn’t heard from the bridal shop. The mum-of-three said: “If they were just honest about the fact they were struggling I’m sure people would find a way to be reasonable. “This is meant to be our big day, our happiest day, and I don’t feel like they appreciated just how we were being made to feel.  “I managed to rearrange so many dferent parts of the wedding after Covid, and the one thing I thought I had sorted three years ago was the one thing missing.” Leanne said she was then shocked to learn that the dress might not even be ready in time for the wedding. She said she asked for a refund and was told to pass her bank details on, but at the same time, the seamstress contacted her. Leanne had her final fitting with the seamstress on September  - two weeks before the wedding. She added: “I was lucky, and the seamstress was just amazing. “But the shop caused me unnecessary stress, after all that planning I didn’t even knowI’d have my dress.”  Leanne and her partner of  years Richard, , tied the knot on October  at The Queen’s Hotel in Leeds - the place where they first met. Leanne’s story is one of at least a dozen which LeedsLive has been made aware of. The situation has got so out of hand that more than  brides have joined the Facebook group. A bride-to-be said her ‘perfect day’ was ruined after the dream dress which she ordered from the boutique six months ago never arrived. The -year-old from Huddersfield, who wished not to be named, has claimed that Abigail’s Bridal Boutique told her that her £, had been ordered in April this year. But she claims that just weeks away from tying the knot with her partner of  years, she was left in tears as the stunning princess ball gown dress was not ready for her first fitting. She claimed that the boutique ignored her desperate calls daily, and eventually told her in October that the dress had not yet arrived in the UK. The unnamed woman said: “I was feeling a bit of everything. “Me and my partner have been together for  years, this year we were celebrating being married and having two children. “We had planned for this for so long and I won’t even have a dress for my wedding. I won’t be able to even turn up to my own wedding. “It’s a day I have dreamed of for so long and they have just ruined that. “I chose my dream dress, and I have been looking forward to getting married for so long and for this to happen. “It’s something you only do once, and now it’s a mad memory because of someone letting me down like that. “I was crying non-stop for two days. This is meant to be a happy experience.” The woman said she has been forced to take out a loan to buy an emergency dress, and says she still hasn’t been refunded for the original dress. She said the boutique had the ‘audacity’ to offer her a used sample in case the dress didn’t arrive - but claims it wasn’t even in her size. Abigail’s Bridal Boutique told MailOnline: “Covid has put many small businesses on the brink including us. We have had no help from the government. “However we are open to solve issues for our customers because we have a duty of care. “We have been closed for months but the bills still have to be paid and we have had supply issues since opening. “However we are focused on staying open and servicing our customers the best we can, that is because we have a duty of care.” The Mirror has contacted Abigail’s Bridal Boutique for a comment.

At some point in , non-EU residents will have to pay approximately £ to enter the eurozone and fill out a new application form before they travel.The fee falls under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System , a largely automated IT system “created to identy security, irregular migration or high-epidemic risks posed by visa-exempt visitors”, SurreyLive reports.The American-style ETIAS is expected to come into operation by the end of , with no confirmed date set as of yet. The exact date from which travellers will be able to apply will be published at a later date.  The fee is only applicable to travellers aged  to , and people will be able to apply via an official website or a mobile phone app. The ETIAS authorisation is not a visa. Travel documents, such as a passport, will also be required. On the plus side, once the application has been completed and approved, it lasts for three years, so travelles will not have to redo the application form - or pay the fee - every time they fly. The scheme is expected to cover  countries, including the UK, Australia and the US. The move will allow countries to pre-screen travellers entering the border-free Schengen area in order to prevent the need for visas after Britain walked away from the EU. It will replicate the US Electronic System for Travel Authorisation , which grants citizens from  countries a -day visa-free stay.

But so far health officials are keeping the proposals secret due to a possible backlash from parents, it is claimed. The vaccination of kids as young as five has already begun in the US and it is set to start soon in Canada and Israel. UK regulators would still need to give the final go-ahead for under-s to have the vaccine and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation must also agree to kids as young as five being jabbed. A source told the Sun: “Top secret plans reveal what is at stakewe are to achieve a meaningful victory over Covid. Asking parents for permission to jab kids as young as five is in the schedule.“It is controversial, but will help us reach our goal. Nothing is in the public domain yet, and the plans could change, but jabbing young children is backed by many scientists. While kids have a much lower chance of falling seriously ill from Covid, they can still pass it on to adults. Data from the Office of National Statistics also suggest that most parents would be in favour of vaccinating children. Currently Pfizer is looking to get the go-ahead from European regulators so that it could start a roll-out of vaccines for children.

In addition to grave stones jutting out of the back garden, the home features stunning stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings. There are also Gothic arches and pillars, and a carved stone pulpit.The property in Heywood, Wilts, was only converted into a residential home by an artist couple seven years ago.The church was last used for its original purpose in  after a decision was made to merge the congregation with another parish.In  the building was sold to an architect who carried out an award-winning conversion into office space which he rented out.It was bought by artists Trevor and Darlas Waugh in  and they converted it from a commercial property into a home and studio to display their work.  They have now put the heavenly home up for sale for the first ever time. The house has , sq ft of accommodation. There is a large reception room, a kitchen, bathroom and sauna on the ground floor, two bedrooms on the first floor and another bedroom and two studios on the top floor. Outside is a garden, although some land with grave stones has been kept by the church. Mrs Waugh, , said: We wanted space and somewhere we could show our work and this was one of those places you walk in and it just takes you over. Itaposs a beautul building, a lovely atmosphere, we were hooked. The property had been a commercial building so it had really old night storage heaters and we had to sort out all the electrics. There was no kitchen and no bathrooms. It was a lot of work.  It was more space than we needed and we were fearful because of the scale of it, but itaposs actually quite an easy property to live in. Itaposs not a run-of-the-mill property, but I think anybody could live there, weaposve had a really eclectic mix of people viewing it. I would just like it to go to someone whoaposs going to love it as much as we do. Neal Wood, from estate agents Hamptons, who are selling the property, said: It is an absolutely stunning property. In many respects it is a classic church. When you walk in you immediately get the feel of a place of worship but at the same time itaposs not overpowering. The owners are both creative and have made enhancements to the property to create an incredibly comfortable environment. Itaposs a great fusion of modern and period. Everybody that has walked through the door has said wow. Itaposs very flexible accommodation, there are only two of them, but you could easily adapt it to have a substantial family living there and add bathrooms and thingsyou wanted to. Something like a church is down to personal taste so itaposs finding the right person who it appeals to but you donapost have to be religious to enjoy a property like this. There are grave stones and the church still owns some land that abutts the property, but you do have a good-sized garden and there is a substantial area of carparking which has suited the current owners for their work but that could be used to create a garden suitable for a family to enjoy.

So when the image of the royal carrying out a face-to-face audience at Windsor Castle with General Sir Nick Carter was first seen yesterday, it was seen as a sign her health was improving. But her hands were noticeably purple raising questions about any potential cause, beyond her advancing years.Dr Jay Verma of the Shakespeare Medical Centre told the : “It might be Raynaud’s phenomenon or just really cold hands. The purple is due to deoxygenated blood.”  Purple hands can be caused by “lack of circulation, frail skin, exposed veins, bruising, a leakage of blood to the tissue beneath the skin, the medical expert added. The Queen had not been seen at in-person event in more than a month since she hosted a reception for the global investment summit at Windsor on Tuesday, October . The next day it was announced that the monarch was taking medical advice to rest.It was later revealed she had a night at the King Edward VII hospital for “preliminary investigations.

After falling and hitting her nose on a door handle in January , Maria went to hospital where medical staff applied Steri-strips but soon after her nose became infected.The mum-of-three soon, who worked for the NHS in the medical records department, developed a flesh-eating infection that caused her nose to completely collapse.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter She explained: I started hearing a whistling through my nose and I thought: aposWhat is that apos When I looked I saw a little hole but by the time I got seen by a doctor it was the size of half a pence and then it just kept getting bigger. Eventually it pierced through my septum. The hole just got bigger and bigger. The pain was absolutely horric when it was rotting away, I was crying in pain. It basically just ate away at the flesh. Maria has since had two nose operations but it has recently collapsed again although not as severely as previous times. Since then Maria has been in and out of hospital with countless infections - but it was only in October  she find out she had MRSA. Maria was told the MRSA lay dormant on her skin for some time- but once there is an open wound, the bacteria gets into the body and doctors no longer know where the MRSA is. The grandmother-of-five explained: If it gets in an open wound it can cause infections or abscesses. I felt like no one was listening to me I was constantly in hospital. I just wanted to know what was wrong. Iaposve been told it was lots of dferent things, even the menopause. I suffer from constant fatigue, just to walk to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee is so tiring.  I watch movies and boxsets just to keep myself sane. When I take bad, I canapost get out of bed. I donapost think a lot of people think about the long-term affects. Mariaaposs le is now completely bound by her poor health and has adapted her diet to lower the risk of infection. MRSA can be transferredyou touch someone who has it, share things like towels, sheets, and clothes with someone who has MRSA on their skin, or touch surfaces or objects that have MRSA on them. It can be removed from the skin with an antibacterial cream or an antibacterial shampoo butyou get an infection, youaposll usually be treated with antibiotics that work against MRSA. This means Maria constantly disinfects her house and uses antibacterial body wash and hand sanitiser religiously to protect loved ones. She said: I had my own business, my own house and now I have nothing, itaposs so frustrating. But I get by, I just take every day as it comes. I love seeing my grandkids but I have to be careful around them too. I have to control it. Iaposve been studying MRSA for years now learning as much as I can about it. Itaposs highly contagious so I bleach my whole house, I use hand sanitiser everywhere and I use the antibacterial body wash. I make sure I eat fruit and veg and make soups and gravies with spices that can help keep infections away. I have to be so careful with any cuts or knocks too.

But something we know for sure about WIlliam and Kate is that they want their children to feel normal and so they certainly won’t be lavishing them with expensive gts, that’s for certain. They won’t let them be spoiled.” William and Kate are likely to head to their beloved country home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk, on the Sandringham estate, as soon as they’re free of commitments in the run up to the big day. Her Majesty will be hoping to host the traditional gathering at her Norfolk abode and on Christmas Eve, Kate and her husband will take the children to the ‘big house’ to see ‘Gan Gan’ for the annual gt swapping – a German festive tradition observed by the royals.Get our daily newsletter for the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up “The Sandringham Christmas is quite formal and traditional and the royals don’t tend to go in for lavish presents,” says Duncan. “Between royals it’s always token gestures or jokey presents, there’s never anything of any real value. They don’t go mad for gt giving either and tend to give each other one present. “We’ve certainly never seen Range Rovers turning up at Sandringham piled high with presents in the boot. There are so many children and grandchildren, it wouldn’t be practical anyway.  “But I think William and Kate will be making their own traditions by having a little family Christmas and presents under the Christmas tree at Anmer. Maybe they’ll even allow the kids to open a few presents before they head off to Sandringham. “I’m told that they’re definitely seeing their other grandparents, the Middletons, possibly for New Year, either at Anmer or they may go to Carole and Michael’s home in Berkshire.“The Middletons will want to make Christmas as special as they can, especially after last year when coronavirus restrictions meant they didn’t get to see their grandchildren. I think they’ll go to town, especially given their access to all the latest decorations with their Party Pieces business.” As for what presents the children are likely to receive, there’s plenty of scope for ideas. George is a big football fan and Cha is his favourite team, despite his dad’s love for Aston Villa. He’s also learning to play the guitar, according to mum Kate, and like his sister Charlotte, he enjoys playing tennis. Sporty Charlotte also loves gymnastics, ballet, horse riding and, according to dad William, unicorns. William also let slip that little Louis loves tractors and bikes.  “The children have plenty of hobbies and interests and William and Kate won’t be short of ideas for presents,” says Duncan. “But you’ve got to remember that with their profile, the children will be sent hundreds of presents from members of the public, as they are every year. “In fact, William and Kate have to shield the children from being absolutely inundated with gts from just about everyone. Let’s not forget that George is a future king and plenty of people want to give him and his siblings presents at Christmas “There are protocols for what happens to these gts and the children will be shielded from them.” Instead, says Duncan, the Cambridges will try to keep things modest at Christmas. “I think the blueprint William and Kate will follow will be to try to have a low-key family Christmas when they can spend time with loved ones. It certainly won’t be about lavish presents.” Comment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And it was there Josh was diagnosed with a tumour the size of a tennis ball - and underwent  hours of surgery to remove it.Cortney, who owns Waterloo Eye Centre, told the story to the Liverpool Echo.Do you have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror. She said: Josh came in for his eye test, his main complaint really was a dryness in his eyes, and he also had a bit of eczema around them.Nothing from his symptoms caused me to suspect that this could have been a major problem. Looking at his eyes during the examination, his pupils were really small, this makes it dficult for me to see the back of the eye itself. So I explained to him that I had to dilate his pupils. She continued: Once the examination reconvened, and his pupils were dilated for me to see the back, it looked like there was swelling on both optic nerves. This is usually an indicator of some kind of pressure behind the eyes. When the optic nerve looks swollen, it is usually due to something pressing against it. It could be a build up of fluid, but it could also be other things. for our newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information and changes at www.mirror email .Cortney said it was scary as Josh was not displaying any typical textbook symptoms that something was seriously, however she could see severe haemorrhaging in his retinas. Due to not being medically trained she wasnapost able to diagnose the problem but after the test stressed to Josh and his mum to go up to the AE department immediately. She said: “I told him it wasn’t they eye department I wanted him to see, and that he needs to take the letter straight to AE. I told him that the team would know from the letter which specialist needs to see him. I also told them that, whilst I am unable to diagnose, we have to treat this as a worst case scenario, meaning that he has to go to hospital immediately to air on the side of caution. Cortney did not hear from Josh and his mum for a week, which she said is unusual as patients usually message the outcome the next day, which is how she knew something was wrong.

The woman was confronted outside the the Ladbrokes in Manor Park, London in footage which surfaced online on Thursday. In the video, the mum is confronted by a man waiting outside the Ladbrokes branch where the child’s buggy remains unattended outside on the street. As the mother exits the bookies, the man yells at her “Are you ok  Why are you leaving your child like this ” The mum sheepishly s to the pram and starts taking her child away. Do you know anything about this incident  Webnews@mirrorBut the man rages at her: “Are you alright in the head  If social services see you they’ll take your child away!” As the man continues filming her, the woman takes one last look inside at the offers in the bookies. At the sight of this, the man warns her: “This is not normal!” The footage has enraged social media users – who have condemned the mum for leaving her child outside on the street so she can gamble in the Ladbrokes store.  One viewer wrote: “I wouldn’t even leave a bike like that and she’s leaving a baby” Whilst another similarly commented “Common sense ain’t common. I bet she would never leave her phone outside but hey its only a kid smh” Another inidual commented: “Social services need to be looking at this.” Whilst one viewer likewise said: “Call police cause some people don’t deserve to be parents [sic]” Whilst another viewer remarked: “She’s gambling with LIFE” The law does not say an age when you can leave a child on their own, but it’s an offence to leave a child aloneit places them at risk. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Childrensays babies, toddlers and very young children should never be left alone.

Nowhere on the planet is global warming having a greater impact than at the polar ice caps, which are heating up at twice the rate of everywhere .The region could lose its summer sea ice as soon as , which would cause a disastrous rise in global sea levels and massive interruption to our weather patterns.The £million MOSAiC project – dubbed “the modern climate science equivalent of going to the moon” – was funded by governments, businesses and academic institutions from  countries.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. Its remit was to gather as much data as possible from the most inaccessible region of the globe in one go. Amy Macfarlane, a -year-old snow physicist from Manchester, was among the scientists and researchers who were sent as deep into the Arctic sea ice as an icebreaker could penetrate. The team was then left frozen in an ice floe to drt for a year while they recovered invaluable and previously unattainable data.

The documentary was then shown at the COP summit. Amy explained how the team investigated the fate of sea ice, as well as the ocean and atmosphere system, for the first time. Worryingly, they found the ice was a lot thinner than expected.

Mum Michelle, from Narborough, Leicestershire, said her daughter Ava suffers from avoidant or restrictive food intake disorder , a condition for which a person avoids certain foods or types of food. The little girl only eats Walkers oven-baked sea salt-flavour crisps, toastie waffles, and a specic kind of baby fruit puree, her mum said. Michelle added that Ava only drinks sweetened almond milk and a prescription vitamin mix. Walkers, one of the most popular brands of crisps in the UK, has been experiencing supply chain issues that led to supermarket shelves being empty.  The disruption, which began last month, was due to an IT system failure and even though the issue is understood to have been fixed, the knock-on effect has been disrupting supplies.The Leicester-based company said that the shortage could last until the end of the month with current stock already in short supply. Michelle said Ava usually eats two packets of crisps a day and once she became lethargic after being without them for five days, BBC News reports.The mum said she and her husband, as well as their family, visit shops every day to look for the crisps as they are desperate to find some for her daughter. Michelle said: When your child relies on a food, and you canapost get it, itaposs really hard.  She added: Thereaposs not a huge nutritional value in the crisps but the salt helps. It makes her drink more. Avaaposs mum said that when her daughter does not have crisps, she feels sleepy and does not have much energy. Michelle said she is feeling anxious as her child loves her favourite crisps, as she explained: Our big fear is having to go to hospital andwe cannot find these crisps, thataposs % a possibility. She added that since sharing her story, many people shared nasty and hurtful comments on social media, with some accusing her of poor parenting. But the mum has encouraged everyone to learn about the eating disorder, which can affect adults as well as children. The causes of ARFID are unknown but it is thought people develop the disorder because of sensory sensitivity, fear of negative consequences or a lack of interest in eating. Treatments available include cognitive-behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, hypnotherapy and eye movement and desensitation and reprocessing therapy .Due to the current shortage, some people started selling single packs of crisps for £ on eBay, with boxes selling for an eye-watering £.Walkers said it is prioritising its most popular crisp flavours, including cheese and onion, ready salted and salt and vinegar, as well as Quavers and Wotsits. Shoppers have also complained about a lack of Monster Munch and Squares. The Mirror has contacted Walkers for comment.

Fortunately, three quarters of UK adults have received both doses of the Covid vaccine, while almost  million have also received their booster jabs, which is hoped help to prevent a severe spike in cases towards the end of . And, people under the age of  are now eligible to get the booster jab at NHS walk-in centres without an appointment.So,youaposre looking to get your third dose, weaposve spoken to Southampton-based GP Dr Reena Virdi to share everything you need to know about the Covid booster jab including what side effects to expect and whether you can mix vaccines.  What are the side effects of the Covid booster jab  There are a wide iety of symptoms you may experience after getting the Covid booster jab, but there are unlikely to y from your first two vaccine doses.According to the NHS, you may experience the following symptoms: A sore arm on the side you got your jab Feeling tired A headache Feeling achy Feeling or being sickOther symptoms include getting a high temperature or feeling shivery for a few days following your vaccine. However, itaposs worth noting that these are are very similar to Covid symptoms, so you should always get a testthey persist for several days. Should you be worried about the side effects of the Covid booster vaccine  According to Dr Reena Virdi, you should not be worried about the side effects of the Covid booster jab.She tells : No, people have already had the first two doses of the vaccine, which have given you initial immunity from coronavirus. This is just boosting what you already have, there isnapost anything new for the body to react to.And, in terms of driving or ing to work, she adds: Thereaposs nothing to say youaposre not recommended to work or drive following the booster vaccination.

Other than taking painkillers, according to Dr Reena Virdi nothing can be done to avoid the side effects of the Covid booster jab. Fortunately, side effects should last no longer than a week, in the worst case.  She explains: You canapost really predict the side effects youaposre going to get with the vaccine. You may have no problems at all, while others may have a few days of feeling a bit achy. However, that usually subsides within about - to -hours. Some people may feel a bit worse for the next week, but thereaposs nothing you can do to avoid the side effects other than avoiding doing anything too strenuous for a couple of daysyou are feeling unwell. And, though the vaccine is there to reduce the severity of the effects of Covid, it doesnapost mean you canapost catch it at all soyour symptoms continue you may need to get tested for the virus. Dr Virdi says: If your symptoms continue for more than a few days. The vaccine doesnapost give you immunity straight away, that will take a couple of weeks. So,youaposre still feeling unwell after several days, she recommends calling  or speaking to your GP to arrange for a PCR test. Can people mix the Covid vaccines for the booster jab  Yes, you can get a dferent vaccine for your booster jab to the first two doses. For example,you got AstraZeneca for your first two doses of the Covid vaccine, you can get Pfizer or Moderna for your booster. Additionally, AstraZeneca is not offered as an option for booster vaccines at all. While Pfizer is the most common booster vaccine offered, Moderna is available in fewer vaccination centres.

The rechargeable “patteries” could be one part of Britain’s renewable energy solution, as kg of cow poo can produce . kwh of electricity. This is enough energy to power a vacuum cleaner for five hours, or do . hours of ironing. Dairy cooperative Arla, which developed the batteries with battery expert, GP Batteries, claim the energy created from the waste of a single cow could power three households for a year. As a result, its ,-strong herd could fuel an “udderly amazing” .m UK homes. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Having a reliable and consistent source of power, like cow slurry – which Arla produces more than m tonnes of annually – could provide new opportunities to power homes and transport. The slurry is turned into energy via a process called anaerobic digestion. Arla farmer Neil Ridgway said: “There is so much potential for innovations such as anaerobic digestion to contribute to the UK’s renewable energy needs while reducing farm emissions with something readily available on our farms – poo.  “On my farm, we already use the energy produced from cow slurry to power our entire estate, but this could go so much further. “We are even able to use the by-product of the process as a natural fertiliser on our land and thereby closing the loop – it’s a win-win situation.” During the process of anaerobic digestion, organic matter such as animal waste is broken down to produce biogas and bio-fertiliser. This process happens in the absence of oxygen in a sealed, oxygen-free tank called an anaerobic digester – and the end product is biogas. Once the biogas is cleaned, it is taken to a Combined Heat and Powerunit, where it is used to generate renewable energy. The end product is nutrient-rich, reduced-emission, natural fertiliser, that can be put back on the land to help nourish the soil. Graham Wilkinson, group agriculture director at Arla, added: “Arla is committed to sustainable farming and reducing emissions from food production. “Our farmers are constantly exploring innovative solutions, and following our poo-powered transport trials last year it’s clear we have only just scratched the surface. “Arla farms are home to around , cows that provide a steady source of slurry – in other words, poo – that can be turned into power that has the potential to make a considerable contribution to Britain’s renewable energy quota. “A small number of our farmer-owners are already turning cow poo into energy. “If the Government and the energy industry could see the potential, the scaling up of cow power could be a game-changer for the UK’s renewable energy supply, whilst also helping reduce emissions in farming.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Arla Foods UKEnergyRenewable ResourcesCows\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She asked why don’t you like it  I explained that it was wonky, above the eyebrow when I specically said I wanted it just below and the thinning had given dferent thickness throughout … the hairdresser was clearly shocked I said no and said aposI’ve seen lots of fringes and this is fine.apos The manager also sided with her, I paid and leftfor the colour, cut and blow-dry.

There is nothing you can do with a fringe that is too short and feathery. A third wrote: I think you were right to leave the one. While a dferent user proclaimed: Good for you for standing your ground. At the end of the day it’s YOUR hair andyou don’t like it then the hairdresser hasn’t done a very good job. I’ve had so many dodgy haircuts and British politeness led to me saying I loved it when I hated it. However, others thought she might have been overreacting a little. A fth person added: I donapost think itaposs terrible, and I wouldnapost have given them a one. Maybe a three and a comment about them not listening to what I asked for. While a sixth pointed out: These things happen sometimes, nobody’s perfect, mistakes happen, no need to be a d**k about it.

She sent him to hoover upstairs and soon he was complaining of an injury, and Bethan assumed Nathan was just pretending so he could get out of more work. But it turns out he had actually broken two bones in his leg, after somehow falling down the stairs, so she called him an ambulance and he was taken to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Wales, for treatment. What do you think about Nathanaposs attempt at housework  Let us know in the comments...Bethan, from Rhondda, Wales, said: At first I didnapost believe him - I thought he was pulling a fast one. Looking back, itaposs quite hilarious really. I even warned him about being careful around the vacuum cord in case he tripped. Heaposs completely recovered now and doing fine - it hasnapost got him out of doing the housework though. Bethan and Nathan, who isnapost currently working, have lived together for the last two years.  According to Bethan, who studies barbering at Bridgend College, Wales, Nathan has never been a fan of housework and tries to avoid doing chores. On this occasion, Bethan convinced him to help with the hoovering for the aposfirst timeapos and he started at the top of the stairs but didnapost get very far when he tripped and fell. She said: He had a bit of a moan about hoovering but managed to do some. Then I heard a massive crash and thought heaposd fallen through the ceiling.  When I found him in a pile at the bottom of the stairs, he was tangled in the hoover cord and couldnapost walk. At first, I thought he was just trying to get out of more cleaning but he was clearly in a lot of pain, so we knew heaposd really hurt himself. We had so many paramedics in the house and nosey neighbours watching - it was quite funny. Nathan, who is now fully recovered and back on his feet after the accident, said: It was very painful at the time. The bed rest was amazing and itaposs nice being back on my feet.

Now, villagers nearby can hear the noise tooResidents in nearby Stapleton can hear the noise too Image: GoogleByNick DawsonChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov | commentsA strange noise that has been bothering villagers for a year can now be heard from people living miles away too. Residents in Earl Shilton, Leicestershire, said the low-frequency droning sound has become louder in recent weeks. Now Brian Heath, who lives in nearby Stapleton, said the sound can be heard from there too.He told Leicestershire Live : It’s quite a heavy noise. It makes your body vibrate, the air is moving so much. It’s very low level, but you can feel the pressure on your body.It’s a weird noise, it could be drilling, driving through rock.I used to work for British Gas, we used to get a lot of tunnel boring. It’s a very deep sound. It’s there all the time. Brian said the noise does not bother him much, but he can hear it even while watching TV. Ange Redshaw, who lives in nearby Barwell, said the strange sound can be heard  hours a day, even over traffic noise, and at night a vibration can be felt while lying on the pillow. Local resident Robert Elsey, director of PESLimited, an engineering firm based in Burbage, suggested the source of the peculiar noise may be a noisy transformer. He explained: My company installs acoustic enclosures and walls around and in front of transformers to reduce noise affecting local neighbourhoods. We worked on a similar project about three years ago, noise from a large transformer made items inside a house vibrate. Another person suggested the sound may be related to an electrical issue, as they said: With the description of the noise being constant, pulsating and humming, this most likely points to it being an EMIissue, as it matches the characteristics of electricity. Similar to a dodgy light dimmer switch etcyou have ever heard one. Severn Trent Water and Western Power Distribution told Leicestershire Live they were not aware of any issues in the area and they had not received any reports about the noise.

Graham then provided a lot of questions with either checkbox to tick or space to leave a comment, such as what time she would like to meet, and her preference of date location, and activity. Katrina picked the movie option and said she checked all the boxes for cuisine because she is not very good at picking food.

The virus - which is in the same family as smallpox - was found in a person who had recently ed to Maryland from the African nation, officials said. Their condition is not believed to be serious. Currently, the Centres for Disease Control is working with the airline and health officials to ensure that all passengers on the flight are contacted in case they contracted the virus. Earlier this year former UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that there were two cases in Wales, with the uncomfortable condition appearing to be re-emerging.  There were no reported cases in Nigeria for  years before , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but since then there have been . The Maryland Department of Health confirmed the latest case in the US, with the patients said to be isolating but not requiring hospitalisation. Maryland Department of Health deputy secretary for public Dr Jinlene Chan said: “Public health authorities have identied and continue to follow up with those who may have been in contact with the diagnosed inidual.  “Our response in close coordination with CDC officials demonstrates the importance of maintaining a strong public health infrastructure.” Health officials have reassured the public that they do not need to take any special precautions. Earlier this year the US confirmed its first monkeypox case since , when a man was found to have it in Texas. In June two people - both members of the same household - were monitored after the virus was identied in North Wales. Public Health Wales said at the time that the wider risk to the public is low. It is understood one person contracted the virus overseas, and then passed it to someone they live with.The monkeypox virus causes a disease with symptoms similar, but less severe, to smallpox, according to the World Health Organisation .The illness emerges with flu-like symptoms and swelling of the lymph nodes and develops into a widespread rash on the face and body. During the illness the rash changes from raised red bumps, to spots filled with fluid. The spots eventually form scabs which later fall off.  While all strains of the virus cause infection, those circulating in Africa generally cause less severe symptoms. Generally, monkeypox infections last two to four weeks and is mostly spread through respiratory droplets. Speaking to MPs in June, Mr Hancock said: “As Health Secretary, you’re dealing with these sorts of outbreaks all of the time - I’m currently dealing with a monkey pox outbreak and cases of drug resistant TB, and that is absolutely standard.

Three Lions supporters at the most controversial World Cup ever will need meticulous planning to find affordable accommodation, and booze. The Qataris are expecting . million fans to visit their country, which is barely more than half the size of Wales. Supermarkets don’t sell beer but there will be “fan zones” dotted around the capital Doha where beer will be on sale at £ a pint. The zones will be sealed off by high fences and screens. Qatar is also planning a huge new campsite in the desert and two giant cruise ships to accommodate football fans from around the world.  The Emir of Qatar The country’s ruler loves England. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, , has three wives and  children. He was educated at Sherborne College in Dorset, Harrow in North London and Sandhurst Military Academy, Berkshire. He has urged locals to show “openness and tolerance” to England supporters. One FIFA source said as long as supporters “show respect to local customs” they will be “very welcome”. Law and order If fans are caught being drunk or urinating in public they will be taken to Doha’s notorious Central Jail. Their head will be shaved before they appear before a magistrate. Under Qatar law they could face flogging but it’s more likely they will be deported.  Lestyle It may be a deeply conservative country but scratch the surface and it’s party central. While it’s not as wild as Dubai, there is a frenetic fun scene in the happy hours of posh international hotels. The stadiums and metro system are fantastic. Local restaurants are cheap and there are branches of McDonald’s, KFC and Pizza Hut everywhere. There is very little crime and no ­graffiti or litter to be seen anywhere. Many of the local Qataris and migrant workers speak English. Road and metro signs across the capital are in English. Ubers are plentul and cheap, andyou do rent a car, petrol costs just p a litre.The weather next November and December is likely to be the same as a hot English summer’s day. Alcohol Buying alcohol is a nightmare. Beer and wine are not served in any city-centre restaurants except in high-end hotels. Even in Happy Hour it’s £ a pint. A bottle of house red is £. Most hotels have happy hours for two hours and outside these times you’d need a second mortgage to buy a round. There is one off licence in the whole of Qatar and don’t imagine you can just stroll in there for a few tinnies. The ironically named Qatar Distribution Company is situated in a barren dusty suburb next to the Ideal Indian Primary primary school. As well as booze, it sells pork, which is also banned from supermarkets. There are security staff manning the entrance behind barriers that only let people throughthey have a permit. When we arrived we were immediately asked: “Are you from the embassy ” When we said “No” they refused us entry and called the head of security. He explained that with no permit it was strictly no sale. A worker at our hotel said: “It’s unbelievably strict. EvenEngland fans started planning now and had some sort of address in Qatar, they still wouldn’t get a permit. It will be pricey hotels, the fan zones or the black market for Three Lions fans.”  Those lucky enough to secure a permit are officially invited to apply through their employers. A y application form is filled out and each customer must be sponsored by a company official. The person must be able to prove they earn above a minimum amount. They can only spend a certain percentage of their monthly income on booze. The permit can only be used by the person named and any alcohol bought must be for personal consumption only. The fans World Cup organisers are bracing themselves for a huge increase in visitorsWales and Scotland qualy. Both countries could bring well over , fans eachthey make it through the play-offs next year.  Wales haven’t qualied for the final stages since . Scotland haven’t made it that far since . It means generations of supporters have never seen their team in the final stages of the World Cup. And it could lead to a massive demand for tickets, with the tournament just a seven-hour flight from Cardf or Edinburgh.

Whether it’s from age, bad weather, or the road was paved poorly to begin with, potholes show up.As with most things in le, they can be fixed the right wayor the wrong way, meaning they quickly open up again.Repairing potholes quickly and correctly is important because it prevents further degradation of the road.It seems easy enough to just fill in the open hole in the road or carpark with new tarmac, but this actually is just a temporary stop-gap. The pothole will almost certainly reappear, and the area between the old tarmac and new tarmac will become the weakest part of the road.Our hardworking and at times thinly-stretched front line road men do a terric job but they like all departments are limited by what funding they receive, as is the wider council.As your local councillor I will continue to build on past success in lobbying for more infrastructure investment and will do my upmost to make sure that no road is left behind.While I can#t guarantee success, I can guarantee that I will be relentless in my pursuit of a better deal for our local ward and the wider Argyll and Bute constituency.As we pause to remember the fallen on Remembrance Day our thoughts naturally turn to the veterans of the Second World War, rightly so.This stoic and humble generation made the ultimate sacrice and have been an inspiration for the countless servicemen and women who have followed after them.We must also remember those who answered their country’s call to serve more recently in campaigns in the Middle East, and Europe.Events in Afghanistan this year reminded us all, not least those who had served there and their families, that for those who do their duty, duty does not end when they arrive home.For many, the physical and mental impact of their service remains with them for the rest of their lives.Our mission at the fund is to find all those who did their duty, however long ago, and ensure they know we are here for them, as long as they need us.In celebration of their service, we are calling on members of the public to share their loved ones’ stories as part of our Month to Remember.

before dawn when the moon has set, with predictions suggesting we could see up to  meteors per hour.The meteor shower could be spotted throughout the month, however it will likely be strongest and

early Thursday morning look set to be cloudy with rain, which does not provide ideal conditions for seeing shooting stars.Those in the south are in for a better chance atseeing the display, with more intermittent cloudand dry weather forecast.However, we cant rule out seeing the meteor shower in Scotland for goodeven though Thursday morning will mark the point with the most shooting stars, the Leonid shower could continue in the following days, just with fewer meteors.Its best therefore to keep your eyes peeled over the coming days to be in with a chance of spotting some shooting

Last Saturday night Sloan played tracks from this sexagenarian debut album as well as the odd Dreamboys single.In between, Capaldi and Sloan reminisced about the early s Glasgow scene that they both were part of and Capaldi revealed that winning an Oscar film Franz Kafkarsquos Itrsquos a Wonderful Le was almost a sexual experience.The tracks from the Saint Christopher album sound pretty good actually and make you wonder what would have happenedCapaldi had continued in music.

After their duet finished, they started talking and he learned that in the s she had helped desegregate a local school.ldquoWe always think of these things like slavery and redlining and desegregation and all these things astheyrsquore ancient history, Patterson pointed out. But the people who lived through those times are just a generation or two away, ldquoour parents and grandparents and great grandparents.After that the programme moved between learned explanations of the musicology behind the song and emotional retellings of how it soundtracked personal experience.Everything makes me cry these days, butyou donrsquot end up with tears in your eyes listening to Lesley Pearlrsquos tale about her ailing birth mother therersquos something wrong with you.Sing it, Tammi.Listen Out For: The Listening Service, Radio , pm, tomorrow.

She explained that a formal decision on this would be announced next Tuesday, and that consultation with businesses would take place later this week.The First Minister said that extension of the scheme is likely to include a broader scope of businesses, such as indoor cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.

She said that the scheme may also begin to accept proof of a recent negative COVID- test as an alternative to the vaccine passport.Ms Sturgeon, who said that while she hoped to keep businesses across Scotland open throughout the winter, the Government has not completely ruled introducing harsher restrictions should the COVID- situation worsen. She has urged all business owners and employers to think carefully and #look again# at whether their employees can be supported to work from home, this winter.#While we hope we will get through winter without introducing further restrictions, we do have a duty to keep proportionate options under review,# she said.#We are publishing an updated strategic framework today, covering some of the issues have already summarised.#Finally, the First Minister urged the nation to stick as closely to the current guidance as possible in order to prevent the spread of COVID-.

Therefore, the pick up  drop off point for passengers will be from Park of Ayre and therefore there will be no service between the First Barrier and Park of Ayre during the period of closure.Posters notying passengers of the ersions will be placed on the X service, Kirkwall Travel Centre and affected bus shelters. It should be noted that passengers can track buses across Orkney on the Stagecoach App which would provide accurate timings.OIC apologises for the inconvenience this will cause during the period of road closure.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637251036284.jpg--covid_19___thu_18th_november_figures.jpg?1637251037000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211118newscovid 19 thu 18th november figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of Health PremiumSwann facing legal action over lack of mandatory testing for care home staffSwann launches fresh push on vaccines as health service struggles with enormous demandLong delays blamed for over , patients leaving AE before treatment finishedCovid booster jabs: Health Minister Robin Swann unveils plan to increase uptakeNI Covid certicate: What do businesses have to do, how will it be enforced and can it be forged Most ReadActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsEast Belfast residents have their say following Bertie Ahern’s ‘ghettos’ commentsBelfast man Jordan Kennedy sentenced to le for murder of his mother Emma Jane McParland in Ormeau Road flatTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest CoronavirusSam McBrideOpinionRates law being rammed through Assembly will have huge implicationsSwann facing legal action over lack of mandatory testing for care home staffMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageApproval of mandatory Covid passports responsible for ‘small surge’ in young people getting vaccinatedCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsLatestChildren in Need chairwoman praises ‘generosity of British public’Labour pledges tougher sentences for LGBT hate crimeAntonio Conte relishing opportunity to work with Harry Kane at TottenhamIreland taking ‘mitigating actions’ amid Covid cases surge, health chief saysPhotos of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted online,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Isabel InfantesLisa SmythTwitterNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailActor and political activist Laurence Fox is remaining tight-lipped over a controversial tweet in which he appeared to poke fun at the appearance of the Alliance Party leader.The outspoken opponent of lockdowns and face coverings is facing accusations of body-shaming Naomi Long for a social media comment he posted in response to the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid passports.Sharing a post by Vote Leave supporter Jeffrey Peel, which included a photograph of the Justice Minister, Mr Fox said: “She’s going to regret voting that way when the vaccine passport becomes a health passport.”He subsequently tweeted: “Stormont hasn’t been able to agree on anything for years. I do hope someone is following the money.”Read MoreAllison Morris:OpinionLatest online abuse directed at Naomi Long driven by misogynySinister Dungannon graffiti targeting Robin Swann condemned by local partiesMs Long and Health Minister Robin Swann have both faced a barrage of abuse since the controversial decision on Wednesday afternoon to approve vaccine passports in Northern Ireland.In addition to comments criticising Mr Swann on social media, the Health Minister has also been singled out in sinister graffiti. His name was daubed on a wall in Dungannon, along with a target mark.It appeared hours after a -year-old man was remanded in custody on charges which include making threats to kill Mr Swann as well as harassment and improper use of electronic communications.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The abuse directed at Ms Long, in particular the posts by Mr Fox and Mr Peel, have prompted an outpouring of support from across the political spectrum. Lewis actor Mr Fox, the ex-husband of actress Billie Piper, has not responded to requests to comment on his controversial tweet.However, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis was among political leaders who expressed solidarity with Ms Long.“The vile misogynistic abuse that has been directed towards her since yesterday’s vote is disgusting and has no place in this echo chamber or outside of it,” he tweeted.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and UUP leader Doug Beattie also blasted the online abuse.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard accused those behind the abuse of being “cowardly ... to launch the type of attack on a female public representative that Naomi Long has suffered on Twitter. Utterly pathetic.”Northern Ireland’s mental health champion Siobhan O’Neill, who wrote to the Executive to urge them introduce vaccine passports, also offered her support to Ms Long.“I stand in support of Naomi Long and in condemnation of vile, misogynist, personal attacks on women in public le,” she said.”Irish language activist Linda Ervine also pledged solidarity to Ms Long, describing her as “a woman who never lacks courage”.Related topicsNaomi LongRobin SwannUlster Unionist PartyThe Executive OfficeTwitterBrandon LewisSDLPDoug BeattieChris HazzardSinn FéinMore On Naomi Long PremiumAndrew Madden’s weekly political spin: From the missing minutes to east Belfast ghettos PremiumYou can push yourself: Alliance councillor Peter McReynolds living with multiple sclerosis to run for Stormont PremiumViewpointOpinionPoliticians do not deserve this abuseNaomi Long and Robin Swann inundated with support following Twitter abuseCovid passports NI: DUP’s Sammy Wilson blasts plan as ‘unacceptable step towards unwarranted state control of people’s lives’Most ReadActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsEast Belfast residents have their say following Bertie Ahern’s ‘ghettos’ commentsBelfast man Jordan Kennedy sentenced to le for murder of his mother Emma Jane McParland in Ormeau Road flatTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest Northern Ireland‘It’s not rudeness’: Bethany Firth opens up on memory problems and calls for more understanding of mental health issuesGlen vs St Eunan’s: Emmett Bradley confident he can hold the middle ground as Derry champions set sights on an Ulster adventureHow Enniskillen Gaels learned from forgetting youth as they prepare for Fermanagh finalChanging Covid picture is a concern for Irish League, admits Colin McKendryDesert storm... but Qatar determined to host a spectacular  World CLatestChildren in Need chairwoman praises ‘generosity of British public’Labour pledges tougher sentences for LGBT hate crimeAntonio Conte relishing opportunity to work with Harry Kane at TottenhamIreland taking ‘mitigating actions’ amid Covid cases surge, health chief saysPhotos of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted online,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer First Minister Arlene Foster.Garrett HarganTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe former First Minister Arlene Foster has expressed her annoyance about the common refrain that religion should be taken out of politics.Mrs Foster, an Anglican, said having a strong Christian faith should have a positive impact on politics.She explained: “Christianity doesn’t call you to be neutral. It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in.“It does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the door… like it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.“Your Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You can’t just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.”In one of her first public appearances since she quit politics, Mrs Foster took part in the Autumn Series at the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick, the world’s only permanent exhibition to Saint Patrick.She was in conversation in front of a live audience with former UTV presenter Gerry Kelly and opened up about her faith, political career and the trauma of the Troubles.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said “we got into a spiral and we couldn’t stop it”.Mrs Foster added: “It got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.”She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. “He used to joke with me and say, ‘How are the Anglicans doing Arlene’ ”Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: “I never knew Dr Paisely personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the sixties, seventies and eighties.”She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. “I don’t know. I can’t answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider.“He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.”The audience included The Dean of Down, the very Reverend Henry Hull and her long-time friend, and former Education Minister Peter Weir MLA, who is recovering from surgery.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason for going into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border - and a bomb attack on her school bus driver, in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.“It was a very strange time,” she said. “My mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I don’t know what she was doing but I will never forget her face….she just froze.”Ms Foster said it was not politically correct to say it but she felt she benefited from being educated at an all-girl school, where she grew in confidence.The former political leader said she was enjoying her new role in journalism as a presenter on GB News.Related topicsArlene FosterMore On Arlene FosterIn court: Former DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly s to le as barrister PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionIs threat of SF First Minister enough to get DUP vote out My father held dying woman in his arms after blast: McAleeseHonouring the war dead… NI falls silent for fallen heroes PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionTwo decades on and our police is still failing to win some hearts and mindsMost ReadActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsEast Belfast residents have their say following Bertie Ahern’s ‘ghettos’ commentsBelfast man Jordan Kennedy sentenced to le for murder of his mother Emma Jane McParland in Ormeau Road flatTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest Northern Ireland‘It’s not rudeness’: Bethany Firth opens up on memory problems and calls for more understanding of mental health issuesGlen vs St Eunan’s: Emmett Bradley confident he can hold the middle ground as Derry champions set sights on an Ulster adventureHow Enniskillen Gaels learned from forgetting youth as they prepare for Fermanagh finalChanging Covid picture is a concern for Irish League, admits Colin McKendryDesert storm... but Qatar determined to host a spectacular  World CLatestAntonio Conte relishing opportunity to work with Harry Kane at TottenhamIreland taking ‘mitigating actions’ amid Covid cases surge, health chief saysPhotos of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted onlineScotland hit by second earthquake in a week with Highlands tremorPolice open fire amid ‘orgy of violence’ during Covid protests in Rotterdam,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its organisers, Market Place Europe, announced that it will be mandatory at all times for those seeking entrance to the market from Saturday to provide a Covid passport, proof of vaccination, proof of a negative Covid test or lateral flow test taken in the previous  hours, or evidence of a positive PCR test taken in the previous  to  days.Customers will also be encouraged to wear masks and make payments using cards instead of cash where possible. Footfall will be closely monitored and when nearing capacity, a queuing system will be put in place and there will be a number of hand sanitising stations throughout the premises.They also said that “the operating environment is subject to change” in preparation for legislative change due on November , adding that “with this in mind we will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated”.Read MoreCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsApproval of mandatory Covid passports responsible for ‘small surge’ in young people getting vaccinatedBut coronavirus precautions won’t get in the way of the excitement of those setting up for the market’s reopening, with make-up entrepreneur Ciara Daly believing it couldn’t have come at a better time.“We missed last year, so we’re absolutely delighted to be back. Everybody needs a lt,” said the west Belfast woman, who runs her own business and owns a salon on the Lisburn Road.“We need a bit of magic back in our lives and there’s no better time to bring the magic back than Christmas, and I think that the Christmas market is the thing that epitomises that out of everything in Belfast.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Kids, grannies and everybody in between all love the Christmas market. I’m hoping to get a great footfall, that everyone is looking forward to it as much as I am, and that they’re all going to help ‘spend local’.”The ‘spend local’ prepaid debit cards issued by the NI High Street voucher scheme can be used at many of the local stall holders’ discretion, and Ciara is encouraging the public to do so to help out small homegrown businesses like her own and that of artist Danni Simpson, who has a stall right beside Ciara outside the front of City Hall.Danni would have gained a lot of commissions for murals in hospitality businesses, but found work drying up a bit when a lot of that industry had to close.“I had to focus on online sales and juggle dferent things. It’s been quite dficult, so hopefully this goes really well and people get out shopping and ‘spend local’. I’m excited for more people to get to see my art.”Brexit has also affected the Australian native, with a lot of packaging products being out of stock, unable to deliver to Northern Ireland or having postage costs higher than the price of the products themselves.While admitting some aspects have been “a little bit harder to navigate”, it’s her first time having a stall at the market, and she’s now feeling positive about being able to show the public her creations up close.“All the maps I have of cities and countries across the world are very intensely detailed, so although I have an online shop, for people to come down and actually see everything, they can personalise it and gt wrap it or whatever they want to do.“Everyone here has been so supportive, it’s my little home away from home. I like telling the story of dferent cities, not just the tourist side of it, but what it feels like to be at home within this city.”The Aussie artist has lived in Belfast for nearly four years, coming originally to visit her Belfast-born granny, and now believes “it’s been the perfect place to land”.Of course, it wouldn’t be the Christmas market without the legendary German beer tent, owned by Merry Monk Taverns, of which Alan Gilchrist is the managing director.“Everyone can’t wait for a Paulaner beer, or a strawberry beer, which we’re really famous for,” he said.The tavern is annually renowned for its Paulaner Oktoberfest Lager which is brewed for the Munich Beer Festival.“We usually have three lorries in from Munich and there’s  pallets per lorry,  kegs per pallet - so there’s thousands of pints here!” assured Alan.While he believes the demand will exceed previous years, he also thinks Covid precautions may lead to a reduction in business.“Obviously we’ve got to limit numbers and adhere to all the restrictions. Brexit has made things dficult, trying to get the codes for everything we needed to bring over was nearly impossible.“Trying to speak to the right people was awful, and it took us six months to get the right codes and the right people, but once you do that, it’s relatively easy. It’s just the knowledge isn’t freely available and it’s very frustrating.”Further inside the City Hall grounds is OutsideIn, a local clothing service that provides an additional product to someone experiencing homelessness with every purchase made.Founded in  by Cullybackey man David Johnston, the company has recently provided products to over , homeless people across the globe and this will be their third time appearing at the Christmas market.“Getting to have that face-to-face value now with your customers is incredible, as well as seeing people experiencing homeless coming in and getting some products at the stall,” said David.David pointed out that while the impact of Covid has been “tough” on OutsideIn, the numbers of homelessness have also risen dramatically. Since the virus’ outbreak, his team have additionally provided meals and hygiene kits to those in need, alongside their ‘wear one, share one’ mantra.He hopes that because of the pandemic, people will feel more encouraged to help others in need and believes the market is the perfect place to instil a sense of community.“In general, I think the market does so well because people love coming together, they love the experience of Christmas time and family, friends and community and it creates that togetherness, and we’ve missed that for two years, which is why I think this year is going to be even bigger.”The market will open at noon on Saturday November  until December . It will open Monday - Wednesday from am-pm, Thursday - Saturday am-pm, and Sunday will be from pm-pm.Most ReadActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsEast Belfast residents have their say following Bertie Ahern’s ‘ghettos’ commentsBelfast man Jordan Kennedy sentenced to le for murder of his mother Emma Jane McParland in Ormeau Road flatTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest Northern Ireland‘It’s not rudeness’: Bethany Firth opens up on memory problems and calls for more understanding of mental health issuesGlen vs St Eunan’s: Emmett Bradley confident he can hold the middle ground as Derry champions set sights on an Ulster adventureHow Enniskillen Gaels learned from forgetting youth as they prepare for Fermanagh finalChanging Covid picture is a concern for Irish League, admits Colin McKendryDesert storm... but Qatar determined to host a spectacular  World CLatestAntonio Conte relishing opportunity to work with Harry Kane at TottenhamIreland taking ‘mitigating actions’ amid Covid cases surge, health chief saysPhotos of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted onlineScotland hit by second earthquake in a week with Highlands tremorPolice open fire amid ‘orgy of violence’ during Covid protests in Rotterdam,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Robinson.Bertie Ahern. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA paramilitary mural on the Newtownards Road in east Belfast.Allan PrestonTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailResidents in east Belfast have largely defended their home after former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern named the area in the same sentence as “ghettos” – while also saying people were incapable of understanding the Northern Ireland protocol.Mr Ahern drew criticism from unionists on Thursday after speaking at an event hosted by the Brexit Institute at Dublin City University.“I spend a lot of my le still in the North. The reality is in East Belfast and in the ghettos and in the areas where you’re likely to get trouble, is that people haven’t got a clue about the protocol, not a clue. They see it as identity,” he said.Mr Ahern said that loyalists were only able to view the protocol as a “trick by the south” to force them into a united Ireland.In a later interview with RTE radio, Mr Ahern denied his comments were anti-loyalist, adding: “There are many areas in my own constituency in the past where they were described as ghettos or rough areas.“Thankfully we moved away from that, so I don’t think people should get themselves in a knot.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBertie Ahern told to apologise for loyalist #ghetto# remarkOn east Belfast’s Newtownards road on Friday, many residents said they were offended by the remarks, while one former shipyard worker wholeheartedly agreed.Waiting on the shutters of her hairdresser to open, one longtime resident, who referred to herself as Mrs B, said: It sounds ridiculous. At one time, east Belfast did look like a ghetto because there was a lot of shops and things closing.But it’s got on its feet again, so calling it a ghetto now is a bit too much. There are some streets I hardly recognise because there’s that many new buildings and houses.A lot of these streets were just little one room places with a toilet that’s out the back. But today it#s new houses everywhere you look.”On Mr Ahern’s comments about the protocol, she said: “I very rarely listen to politics. Sometimes I think politicians will just say what you want to hear.”Discussing the recent bus burnings carried out by loyalist paramilitaries as a protest against the protocol, she said: “It’s sad to think we’re going backwards as whenever I grew up, you were dodging bullets.”James Nelsonworked in the Belfast shipyards for over  years and said Mr Ahern was right to call his home a ghetto.I was born and reared down here, they haven’t improved anything,” he said.They’ve actually made it a worse ghetto and tore the heart right out of east Belfast and lower Newtownards Road.There’s hardly any shops and there’s just one pub on this whole road when there used to be around .They’ve boxed everything in and they’ve put no infrastructure in at all.”He added: “I think Bertie’s got it right, there#s nothing down here for anyone. Especially with the drug problem in east Belfast right down to Bangor.It doesn’t seem to be getting addressed whatsoever, even though the dogs in the street know who’s at it.”He said Mr Ahern was probably right that most loyalists didn#t understand the protocol.I don’t believe we think it’s a trick though. Although some people are blind after listening to the DUP as usual.Personally, I think the DUP signed up for it and backed Boris, then Boris back-doored them and said ‘see yous later’ as the Conservatives always do.”Nearby, waiting for a metro bus into town was Mr A. Robinson . He said he took exception to having east Belfast dismissed by Mr Ahern.“Personally speaking, the ordinary common man in the whole of Ireland doesn’t really understand the protocol,” he said.I don’t understand it and I think half the people in Stormont don’t understand the protocol. We’re relying on our politicians here to work the protocol out.But Mr Ahern is an intelligent man, he shouldn’t have said things like that because that’s wrong.I’d say % of people down south don’t understand the protocol either.”Mr Robinson also rejected the idea that east Belfast was a ghetto.There is a couple of ghettos in east Belfast but that’s not true for the majority of the area,” he said.You have rough areas anywhere  like in the Shankill but it’s not fair to say we’re in a ghetto.I think sometimes politicians like Mr Ahern speak without using their brains, he may regret it later on.”A short distance up the road, another resident, Robert Jenkins , was out walking his two dogs.“I’m not happy to hear east Belfast called a ghetto, I don’t think Bertie Ahern’s been in east Belfast enough to pass comment,” he said.I’ve lived in east Belfast all my le and I’m proud of it. Like in every part of the province, there’s rough parts but there’s also areas where the houses cost nearly a million pounds, it’s hardly a ghetto.”He said he did believe the protocol had the effect of chipping away at the identity of the community.This is just the straw that broke the camel’s back really. We’re not allowed to march where we want and things like that, so people feel they’re being picked on in east Belfast.”Another lelong resident, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I don’t know about anyone  in east Belfast but I definitely don’t consider it to be a ghetto.There are honest, hardworking people and to say that it’s a ghetto is disgusting.”One resident of the Bloomfield area was out with her friend, Stephanie Pepaj , from New York, who has recently started working in east Belfast.Stephanie said: “I don#t see it as a ghetto really. This building here is beautul but I do think there are parts that maybe need more regeneration.But I definitely think it is an up and coming area.”Her friend, from Belfast, added: “I think over the past few years, everything has been developing around here.Even in the past year or two, lots of businesses. House prices out here are more affordable than other parts of the city which is a big attraction too.”On Mr Ahern’s comments about the protocol, she said: “Some people are interested in researching what’s going on and others just go along with the crowd.I think a lot of people probably do think it’s a trick to get a united Ireland and that no one really cares about Northern Ireland at all.”Stephanie added: “It’s alarming when I see the news and hear about burning buses. There’s other violence and crime back home but it’s dferent.It’s confusing because I feel like I can’t really say anything because I would need to know the history and live here for years and years.”Speaking from behind the counter of his butchers shop on the Newtownards Road, David McMullan called Mr Ahern’s ghetto comments “very rude”.People in this area, working class people are lovely. It’s a thriving community where everyone sticks together,” he said.A woman has just been in the shop and she gave me £ to donate to the food bank down the street.She used her High Street Voucher to do that, and another woman did the same thing last Saturday.”On the Northern Ireland protocol, he said: “It is very hard to understand. You have to be really tuned in to understand it.”Sourcing his meat locally, however, he said Brexit concerns had not affected his business.Things like that don’t bother me. I would just tell Bertie Ahern to be more respectful.”Most ReadActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsEast Belfast residents have their say following Bertie Ahern’s ‘ghettos’ commentsBelfast man Jordan Kennedy sentenced to le for murder of his mother Emma Jane McParland in Ormeau Road flatTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest Northern Ireland‘It’s not rudeness’: Bethany Firth opens up on memory problems and calls for more understanding of mental health issuesGlen vs St Eunan’s: Emmett Bradley confident he can hold the middle ground as Derry champions set sights on an Ulster adventureHow Enniskillen Gaels learned from forgetting youth as they prepare for Fermanagh finalChanging Covid picture is a concern for Irish League, admits Colin McKendryDesert storm... but Qatar determined to host a spectacular  World CLatestLabour pledges tougher sentences for LGBT hate crimeAntonio Conte relishing opportunity to work with Harry Kane at TottenhamIreland taking ‘mitigating actions’ amid Covid cases surge, health chief saysPhotos of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted onlineScotland hit by second earthquake in a week with Highlands tremor,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Peter ByrneNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEven prior to the pandemic, it wasn’t unusual for trusts to struggle to find space for patients in their hospitals.As far back as , the Royal College of Nursingwas warning about the dangers of squeezing hospital beds into areas without oxygen points and call bells, while overstretched staff complained they didn’t have enough time to take toilet breaks or administer medication to their patients.The situation deteriorated to the point where thousands of healthcare staff took industrial action at the end of , but there was barely any time between the end of the strike and the arrival of Covid- for NHS workers to catch their breath.So, it’s little wonder that almost two years of a global pandemic have had such a profound effect on the health service.As of Wednesday, there were  Covid occupied beds across the hospital system here, which is  beds not available for the patients who need treatment for non-Covid conditions, some of whom are acute medical emergencies, while others have been suffering without treatment for years.And while they languish on ever-stretching hospital waiting lists, their conditions worsen and they turn more frequently to their GP to manage their symptoms.However, there aren’t enough family doctors in Northern Ireland to cope with demand, resulting in more people going to AE for help.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the same time, an increasing number of people waiting for a hospital appointment are becoming emergency cases, requiring admission to hospital.Meanwhile, staff are exhausted, an unknown number are living with the effects of long Covid, others are trying to process the trauma of working through the pandemic, while the workforce is depleted further due to the requirements of isolation.Add to that the shortage of resources in the community, which makes it so dficult to discharge patients from hospital, and it has created the perfect storm in which we now find ourselves.It is true that the vaccines have put us in a better position than this time last year — but only to a certain degree.Despite the rush when they first became available, health officials have struggled to reach their target uptake.Public confidence in the vaccinations has been damaged by the messages coming from some politicians, as well as the disappointment that they aren’t the silver bullet many people mistakenly believed they would be.The fact that they reduce the likelihood of catching the virus, experiencing serious illness and even decrease the chance of dying from Covid- doesn’t seem enough to convince the sceptics that they are an efficient tool in getting us through the pandemic.Sadly, some have taken an all or nothing approach — either the vaccine works % of the time or it isn’t worth getting, even more so now they have realised the vaccines don’t protect for le.Then there are others who can’t see the bigger picture and the reality that by being vaccinated, they are reducing the risk to those most vulnerable from the virus.Waning immunity is also likely to be a factor in Northern Ireland’s depressing case rate. That’s why the booster programme is so important — but even that doesn’t appear to be rolling out as quickly as hoped. All of this is set against a backdrop of an Executive that has pressed ahead with lting restrictions despite the most ardent warnings from health professionals over the state of the health service.Over the summer, officials were once again caught off guard by the might of Covid-, as case numbers spiked a number of weeks sooner than expected.At the time, they blamed the less than impressive vaccine uptake for the surge in positive cases.As a result of the premature peak, operations were cancelled as staff were erted from their normal roles to help care for the influx of seriously ill patients.Even as the health service faltered and pupils ed to class, the Executive approved further relaxations — at the same time there was a contact tracing disaster in our schools.By the time politicians gave the green light to the reopening of nightclubs, health workers were well and truly exasperated by the path we were on.It was abundantly clear that it wasn’t the best move to allow hundreds of people, many unvaccinated, to cram together in loud and unventilated venues, without social distancing or face coverings, while also adding alcohol into the mix.Even more incredibly, the relaxation was timed to coincide with the Hallowe’en holiday. The warnings from staff on the frontline became more frantic. Unusually senior officials even joined the chorus, with Seamus O’Reilly from the Northern Trust explaining that emergency departments may have to shut in response to the mounting pressure.Then as last weekend approached, rumours began to swirl that the AEs at Antrim and Craigavon were close to collapse, emergency plans were put into place to bolster staff numbers and free up beds. Antrim Area Hospital struggled through, but the measures weren’t enough to stabilise the situation at Craigavon.An ambulance ert was implemented twice in the space of -hours, putting further pressure on the hospitals that stepped in to assist.Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association gave an ominous warning.“This is only the start of it,” he said, as the crisis appeared to finally shake the Executive into action. Eventhere was an acceptable Covid- death rate, the impact of coronavirus goes much further than those who lose their lives as a result of this wicked respiratory virus.The elderly pensioner waiting eight hours on the floor before an ambulance arrives, the families caring for frail loved ones due to a lack of care in the community, the parents sending themselves into debt to fund their child’s much-needed operation, the nurses, porters and paramedics who consistently work hours past their finish time to give the best possible care to their patients despite the system falling down around them.They’re all casualties of this mess we’re in.It wasn’t dficult to predict, as we failed to meet keep coronavirus under control, vaccination rates stuttered, the temperatures started to drop and winter viruses began to circulate, that even a small number of Covid- cases would be enough to tip the NHS over the edge.Related topicsAntrim Area HospitalCraigavon Area HospitalThe Executive OfficeMore On Antrim Area Hospital PremiumCovid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health service Premium died after catching virus as patients in Northern Trust hospitals PremiumAftermath of funfair ride accident looked like scene of a bomb, says shaken councillor‘Behaviour’ of teenagers and ‘misuse’ of equipment blamed for Carrickfergus ride mal‘It was terrying’: Eyewitnesses share their shock at Carrickfergus ride malMost ReadActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsEast Belfast residents have their say following Bertie Ahern’s ‘ghettos’ commentsBelfast man Jordan Kennedy sentenced to le for murder of his mother Emma Jane McParland in Ormeau Road flatTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest Northern Ireland‘It’s not rudeness’: Bethany Firth opens up on memory problems and calls for more understanding of mental health issuesGlen vs St Eunan’s: Emmett Bradley confident he can hold the middle ground as Derry champions set sights on an Ulster adventureHow Enniskillen Gaels learned from forgetting youth as they prepare for Fermanagh finalChanging Covid picture is a concern for Irish League, admits Colin McKendryDesert storm... but Qatar determined to host a spectacular  World CLatestLabour pledges tougher sentences for LGBT hate crimeAntonio Conte relishing opportunity to work with Harry Kane at TottenhamIreland taking ‘mitigating actions’ amid Covid cases surge, health chief saysPhotos of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted onlineScotland hit by second earthquake in a week with Highlands tremor,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive.

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question. Those who said they would not support a career in policing amounted to around a thirdof the party’s voters polled, with a further % undecided.Sinn Fein politicians attended a PSNI recruitment event for the first time in . Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Policing Board member Gerry Kelly attended the event in what was seen as an open show of support for the force.In a recent interview with the Belfast , North Belfast MLA Mr Kelly said: “People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.”However, he added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one. That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI. There were % of Sinn Fein voters who said they either had no opinion or remain undecided.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyUlster Unionist PartyArlene FosterMichelle O#NeillGerry KellyMore On Police Service of Northern Ireland PremiumConcern as  serving PSNI officers not fully vetted PremiumMisogyny should be a hate crime, says senior PSNI officer Mark HamiltonFormer PSNI chief Stephen Martin ‘regrets’ not meeting employee who raised sexual misconduct allegationsMore than  reports of  school TikTok accounts reported since October, reveals PSNICall for social media companies to take action to stamp out abuse from ‘rate your teacher’ Tik Tok videosMost ReadActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsEast Belfast residents have their say following Bertie Ahern’s ‘ghettos’ commentsBelfast man Jordan Kennedy sentenced to le for murder of his mother Emma Jane McParland in Ormeau Road flatTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest PoliticsJon TongeOpinionNo consensus on the past, but  holds out hope for futurePM silent on grope claims against his dad StanleyYou can push yourself: Alliance councillor Peter McReynolds living with multiple sclerosis to run for StormontViewpointOpinionPoliticians do not deserve this abuseActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongLatestAntonio Conte relishing opportunity to work with Harry Kane at TottenhamIreland taking ‘mitigating actions’ amid Covid cases surge, health chief saysPhotos of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted onlineScotland hit by second earthquake in a week with Highlands tremorPolice open fire amid ‘orgy of violence’ during Covid protests in Rotterdam,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For Eimhear, it was a moment she had been waiting on since  when she got her first taste of dancing at the prestigious competition which attracts Irish dancers from all over the world. “The first year Eimhear danced at the Worlds she came sixth. In  she came fth, in  she came third and in  she came second,” said Eimhears mum Bernie. With the Covid- pandemic hitting in early , Eimhears dreams of becoming a World Champion were put on hold once more. “She was so close the last year she performed at the Worlds and she just had it in her head that she was for doing this year – she was determined,” Bernie continued. Mum Bernie made the trip to Killarney with Eimhear, who has been dancing with the McNicholl School of Irish Dancing for approximately  years. She watched on proudly as her daughter took to the stage on November  to show her best moves to the judging . It was a tense wait at the adjudicators made their decision and when Eimhears number was called out Bernie said they both couldnt believe it. “We are just so delighted, there are no words for how we are feeling,” said Bernie “We are all just over the moon. Eimhear puts in a lot of work. She goes to classes three times a week and her daddy Anthony got her her own wee studio out the back so she can practice at home. Shed be out there for an hour or more every night.” Paying tribute to McNicholl School of Irish Dancing, Bernie said: “Sineacutead, Seamus and Niall have been really, really supportive of her. They also put in so much work behind the scenes and should be commended.” Bernie said following her success, Eimhear, who attends St Patricks College, Maghera, was welcomed home last week by her proud family and friends. “Eimhear just couldnt wait to get back to see everybody to celebrate her success. All the family were there with a big banner to welcome her home. Fr OReilly even congratulated her from the altar at the weekend masses.” Speaking about her success, Eimhear, who also plays camogie for Banagher GAC, said she really enjoyed the experience. “It is indescribable how Im feeling and I just want to thank Sinead, Seamus and Niall so much,” said the teenager. “I enjoyed dancing on that stage so much and I just couldnt wait to get on there because I didnt have a single nerve in my body. When my number was called out I just burst out into tears, I was just so happy. “My friends couldnt believe it. They were texting me and messaging me when I was crowned World Champion as they were watching it live on Facebook. “Im now planning to compete at the Worlds in April  so Ill be back at the dancing again this week,” she added. Teacher Sineacutead Burke also paid tribute to the north Derry dancer. She said: “Eimhear is a really good example of hard work pays off and not giving up. She deserves this title so much as she was simply outstanding . Her self belief and the hard work she put in are what earned her that success.”             ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDeep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Danny Cooley.Derry NewsSad passing of Danny Cooley overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

David said: “Each winning photographer received their own copy of the calendar and an organic cotton Trek NI beanie hat.“I know the judges found it really tough choosing just  images from those sent in, such was the overall quality of the submissions.  per cent of every sale goes to PIPS charity, a non-profit organisation which provides crisis support for those at risk of suicide or self-harm. David continued: “ was obviously an incredibly dficult year for everyone due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions imposed on everyday le because of it. “Mental health, which was already a major issue for many around the world, was exacerbated further by isolation and loneliness. “PIPS do fantastic work with those suffering from poor mental health, especiallytheyve considered suicide, so we wanted to help support their efforts this time round.” Trek NI is an online resource and eco-friendly brand inspired by Northern Ireland that connects local businesses with a highly-engaged local audience, championing everything Northern Ireland has to offer.

We just thought, lets try and get them to train for something, and we thought a k was just the right distance. “So, we’re now doing a ‘Couch to k, and we wanted to make it into an actual event, and kind of official, because we just feel like theyve never participated in anything like this before. “Theyve worked so hard and next Thursday, were going to do our official k, asyou were training for a marathonweve got a start line and we’ve got medals. “Danny Quigley is going to come and surprise them and run it with them and cheer them on. We just want to make it as big an event for them as possible because its such a big achievement. “We wanted to do something for them, so they get to do an event. We train people with learning disabilities, thats what we do. We wanted to try and give that opportunity to adults with learning disabilities to push themselves and have goals. “This is their first ever run to show their training and show what they’ve achieved. There’s never really anything like this organised and we wanted to do it for them.” There will be around  to  participants andSineacutead and Bronagh are hoping to encourage families, friends and the Derry public to pop down on Thursday and cheer all the runners on. Sineacutead added: “They’ve trained so hard, especially at this time of the year, in the wind and the rain, they have shownup and they’ve done it no matter what. “Some of them wouldnt even have attempted to go outside before and theyve just come so far. Im so delighted for them andeverythingthey’ve achieved.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDeep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Danny Cooley.Derry NewsSad passing of Danny Cooley overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDeep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Danny Cooley.Derry NewsSad passing of Danny Cooley overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDeep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Danny Cooley.Derry NewsSad passing of Danny Cooley overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

She was admitted to hospital with stroke-like symptoms.  However, In December, Nicoles condition deteriorated signicantly and she lost her eyesight  Speaking to the Donegal Live, Geraldine McDermott said she and her family were “overwhelmed” with the fundraising effort currently taking place in Inishowen and wider Donegal to support Nicoles future treatment.  FND is a medical condition in which there is a problem with the ing of the nervous system and how the brain and body sends and   or receives signals. Symptoms can include motor dys, seizures, vision and speech dficulties, and paralysis. Geraldine said: “Nicole will be under the care of Neurologist, Professor Mark Edwards. Professor Edwards specialises in FND. He will prepare a rehabilitation plan for Nicole. She will be an in-patient in the Brain and Mind Hospital in London for anything from six weeks onwards, depending on how much time she needs.  “FND is essentially a signal, a message from the brain which is not getting to the body. Professor Edwards is hopeful they can turn the signals on again and restore Nicoles eyesight.  “There has been a massive, massive fundraising effort for Nicole. It started off with Veronica Dowds Long completing a k, which finished up in the Wooden Brew Coffee Shop in Burnfoot, where they had a coffee morning. There was another coffee morning in OFlahertys Pub in Buncrana and there was a golf tournament at the North West Golf Club at Lisfannon. Well known Gael, Burnfoots Andrew Wallace organised a Run for Nicole k on November  Sister Act held an event in OFlahertys, Burt GAA held a fundraiser and Burnfoot Service Station sold lines and raised €,. We cannot thank everyone enough.  “On Sundaythere will be a stellar line-up at our major fundraising concert in An Grianaacuten Hotel in Burt. The artists performing include, John McNicholl, Dominic Kirwan and Sandy Kelly, along with local musician, Keelan Arbuckle, and young Killian Joe.” The David Craig Band, which played at Nicole and Ciarans wedding two years ago, is also playing at the An Grianaacuten concert. Tickets for the event are available from the hotel and Creative Landscaping Works in Letterkenny and from Geraldine who can be contacted on: . According to Geraldine, up until December , Nicoles quality of le was fine. She added: “Nicole was having daily seizures and was in chronic pain but she could manage. If she had a seizure, we dealt with it. Maybe a stranger looking on would have thought it was terrible but, it was part of our lives, part of Nicole. “But, in December, she lost her eyesight and then she lost her speech. She now has limited speech and is in bed all the time. She has no social interaction at all now.  “We met Professor Edwards on October . because she will not be well enough, initially, to travel to London, she will begin her treatment here. We have raised €, for Nicoles treatment to date and are going to continue fundraising.  “We would definitely like to thank everybody from the bottom of our hearts. We are overwhelmed. Nicoles consultant is hopeful her eyesight can be restored, as well as her speech and some of her mobility. There is definitely hope.  “I would like to thank everybody. The support for Nicole has been as been overwhelming. We have had businesses and people coming forward with donations without even being asked. The An Grianaacuten concert will be a fantastic. We have loads of prizes, including € vouchers and hampers. Inishowen, Donegal and Derry are rallying around for Nicole.”  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DCUs Donegal contingentSportDonegal students to the fore as DCU win Second Year A football Championship final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsHeres the line-up of guests for tonights Late Late Show on RTE One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Items seized in Donegal Town as part of the search warrant Local NewsGardai seize cannabis with estimated street value of €, and over €, in cash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Moville woman Natasha Crumlish has lashed out at the Health ServiceLocal NewsThe Health Service is broken - Natasha Crumlish overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   Atlantic Way, BundoranLocal NewsTwo Donegal apartments set to go under the hammer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDeaths in Donegal - Friday morning, November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDeaths in Donegal - Friday evening, November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New advice on how long your immunity lasts after Covid- infection National NewsNew advice on how long your immunity lasts after Covid- infection overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeJason Quigley stopped in round two as Demetrius Andrade delivers statement win overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lack of parking enforcement raises concerns from Buncrana tradersLocal NewsThere will be no retail left in five or ten years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAPhoto Gallery of GAA supporters at Junior A  B Finals in ODonnell Park, Letterkenny overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The court heard how police had been called to Secrets night club, Magherafelt, at around .pm on the night of December  , where the security manager told them he had ejected a female. The manager told police she had bottled another female over the head while inside, knocking her unconscious in the process. The injured party had then been taken to AE, where she was forced to remain overnight and had surgical glue applied to a wound. When being arrested, the defendant became irate and police reports from the night in question revealed she shouted “F**k you, f**k your ma and f**k your da” at police and members of the public. She also yelled repeatedly that she did not hit anybody. Later, on viewing CCTV footage of the incident, a guilty plea was entered by the defendant. Judge Mullan noted that the contents of a pre-sentence report completed on McKenna did not endear her to the court. While discussing the injuries to the other female, the report noted the defendant as saying: “She got hair extensions a few days later.” Defence for McKenna said the incident had arisen due to a school-type hostility between the women. Although noting the defendant had no previous record, they conceded that due to the amount of alcohol taken, the defendant had made her debut in a most spectacular way. Counsel also noted that at the time of the offence, McKenna had been just  years old, and had been initially charged in a youth court but turned  in the meantime. They said the incident should be viewed in the context that the defendant was a youth who was intoxicated on licensed premises and that the behaviour was consistent with that context. McKenna had indicated she was unable to complete community service or probation, and Judge Mullan told the court this had limited the options available to her. She sentenced the defendant to four months imprisonment, suspended for a period of  months, and issued a three-year restraining order prohibiting her from contacting the injured party.

Judge Mullan began by telling the court the defendants pre-sentence report had made for unbelievable reading, and that she had no regard for road traffic laws. She said Johnston had already received suspended sentences, probation and disqualication, but that she continued to get into a car in the knowledge that she could well go to prison. Addressing the defendant, the judge asked why this was the case. “A lot of it has to do with my head, but Ive been working with the mental health team to get it in order,” she replied. Judge Mullan told the defendant the court had been patient with her, and noted she had even gone out, bought a vehicle while disqualied and then subsequently drove the vehicle. Defence for Johnston said she had engaged with probation and that they hoped she had begun a process of rehabilitation as a result. The court was told the defendant now understood she could not just get in a car and drive anymore. Judge Mullan ordered Johnston to complete  hours of community service, fined her pound and disqualied her from driving for a further period of  months. A pound offenders levy was also imposed, and the defendant was advised by the judge not to buy any more vehicles while disqualied from driving.

This will mean an extra pound. per week to your energy which will amount to paying out pound a year more than Power NI users did  months ago. Power NI has blamed the rise on the increase in global wholesale gas prices but MS Ferguson says that will cut little ice with Derry households already struggling to make ends meet. She said: “News that hard-pressed families are set to be hit with another price hike will come as another huge blow. “As with all such price hikes, those hardest hit by this will be low-paid workers and middle income families. Many of these families are already struggling to make ends meet. “We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis as energy prices soar largely due to global demand issues at the same time as inflation is rising and food and other costs are increasing. “Sinn Feacutein is calling on the British government to remove VAT on energy bills during this global price spike to help support families. “It should also explore a windfall tax on energy generators similar to that introduced in other European states and redirect the money raised towards tackling fuel poverty.” In response, William Steele, director of Power NI customer solutions, said: “We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible, but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months. “ Like other suppliers, we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tarfs. “As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay. For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDeep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Danny Cooley.Derry NewsSad passing of Danny Cooley overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDeep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Danny Cooley.Derry NewsSad passing of Danny Cooley overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Pic by Seb Daly SportsfileReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk tonight, but he is still hoping to write more chapters in what has so far been a career of glittering success. googletag.cmd.push Ironically, McEleney will bid his farewells to Oriel Park at the end of the game against his new club and hometown team in Derry City. While the Dundalk fans will be saying goodbye, the travelling City fans will be welcoming home a prodigal son in the same breath. McEleney signed with the Lilywhites in December , as he went on the search for trophies – and in that, he has succeeded. Three league titles,  FAI Cups and  League Cups have all been won in Dundalk colours, and he has been part of two squads who have made it to the Europa League group stages. For all those achievements, he has a thousand more memories scoring against BATE Borislov in the Champions League qualying round, scoring a penalty against Sherf Tiraspol to help Dundalk qualy for the - Europa League group stages, and playing against Arsenal at the Emirates. Any footballer would be proud to look back on all that, but not Patrick. For him the past is the past, and he wants to achieve so much more now that he is ing to Derry City. If anything, he is even hungrier than he was when he left the Brandywell six years ago. “It came full circle,” he agrees. “I’m properly excited to kick on with Derry City and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve been watching them a lot, especially since I’ve signed and I’ve been trying to pick up things. There are some really good players there which I knew from playing against them anyway. I’m really looking forward to next year and getting my family back home.” “Whenever he contacted me in  he said he really wanted me and he explained how I was going to fit in and how I was going to play. I went down that first year and won the league and got to the Europa League Group Stages and that was surreal to be honest. “Being in that environment I knew there was only one way it was going and we were going to be successful for a lot of years. I was just thankful to Stephen for the opportunity, but I had no doubts in my own ability and what I was going to be able to do for the team. It was amazing times, but it’s gone now, and it’s in the past and it’s time to make new memories.” McEleney did enjoy some success with Derry City after arriving back from Sunderland back in . A part of the squad which win the First Division that year, McEleney went on to win a League Cup in  and the FAI Cup in . Since then, Derry City have won just one trophy – the  League Cup, while McEleney has gathered enough silverware to make any other footballer jealous. With the tide changing at the Brandywell in recent months following theof Ruaidhri Higgins, McEleney is hoping all those statistics can improve. He would oven thing ore than to win wearing the red and white of his home town club. “Whenever I was leaving Derry at the time, I was leaving home,” he said. “It was no secret about how much I loved the club – I still do, I’m a fan and I still go to Derry matches whenever I can – Even playing against them for Dundalk, I’m not going to lie, it was dficult and it was the same the whole time. “I knew at the time I had to make the move, and I’m clever in that sense to know what I need to do, My timing has been pretty good so far, maybe apart from my Oldham move, but you live and you learn. To come down here and play in two Europa League group stages and won what I’ve won, was definitely the right thing to do, and I’m sure % of people would agree with it.” Unexpected McEleney’s final year at Dundalk did not go how anyone expected, with the Lilywhites at one stage looking over their shoulders at relegation, such has been their fall from grace. A new takeover has restored some optimism to the club, but so much damage has been done, proving that in football, success is never guaranteed. “I could sit here all day and explain a million dferent things of what I believed happened, but it is what it is,” McEleney states. “You have to dig deep sometimes and people get things wrong. The players need to look at themselves too. We’re the ones playing and you have to take some responsibility and accountability somewhere. I do anyway. To go from the Europa League group stages to the way it was this year was not good enough and it was a big shock, but we got through it and that was the main thing.” McEleney’s decision to join Derry City was announced in July, and that did not go down well in some quarters, but there was no doubting the player’s focus, and he starred for Dundalk in the weeks that followed, the stand-out performance coming in the two-goal display against Vitesse Arnheim in August. “It was a strange situation but I had to do it for a number of reasons,” he admits. “I think a lot of people were going to question of I was going to down tools. From the outside looking in, it might look asI’m an easy-going guy, and even in the way I play because I can float about, but the people that really know me, know that’s not me. I’m definitely a winner, and I was never going to let anybody question me as a person or question what I was going to do for Dundalk, so it was up to me to put in performances on the pitch in that period of time to make sure no-one would question me. I believe I did that and more.” Goodbye McEleney was given a nice send-off by some fans at training this week, and he is sure to be given a huge ovation tonight. It is the end of an era for both he and his family. “It’s sad,” he admits. “Obviously during the time of it, it can get frustrating and getting the injury it’s hard and you can get yourself down. But now that I’m leaving and I can look back, of course it was amazing what we did, and the success I’ve had here. “I was training and a fan called me over and said ‘Thanks for everything. You were amazing for the club. We’ll not forget the memories and you go with our blessing’. It was just a nice touch and the club has been the same. “I can’t thank them enough, for what they’ve done, not only for me, but for my family. My kids were raised here, so it will always have a place in our family, but everything is in the past now. To be successful you can’t really rest. You can’t say ‘I’ve won this, I’ve won that’. It’s time for new things and to be able to do it for Derry would be beyond dreams so that’s the target now.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDeep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Danny Cooley.Derry NewsSad passing of Danny Cooley overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

James McClures th minute goal saw the Loup take a healthy six-point lead into the half time break, after the hosts had cut loose during the second quarter. However, St Patricks would not score for another  minutes, and their opponents used the time wisely, chipping away at the lead, with just the goal separating the sides at the second half water break. The Magherafelt side defeated in tonights Jack Cassidy Cup semi final. Loups composure had deserted them and by the time an Eoghan Hawe free reduced the gap to one on  minutes, the side in red looked the more likely winners. Time was on Rossas side, but just as the tide appeared to be turning, Loup rode the wave and hit back, John McClure tapping over a free with five minutes to go to settle the nerves. Aidan McAlynn then slotted another free, and despite a late Magherafelt onslaught that yielded a Dan Higgins point, the hosts held firm to reach a decider against Dungiven. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

If the proposed Mid Down College gets the green light, then it will close and become part of the new school.Cllr Walker said he understood the constraints Blackwater was operating under and that there was no room to expand at its Old Belfast Road site, suggesting that it should also relocate to Down Highrsquos current site when it becomes available.The Rowallane politician has again insisted that he supports integrated education and was behind the proposal to create Drumlins Integrated Primary School in Ballynahinch and Killyleagh Primary Schoolrsquos decision several years ago to embrace integrated status.He said he was ldquoin no way attempting to turn the proposed Mid Down College proposal into a political football, branding such a suggestion as ldquoludicrous.Cllr Walker also rejected claims from Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown that the DUP narrative in the post-primary school proposal was ldquoshort-sighted and  in parts and that the steering group behind the new Mid Down College had no intention of taking students away from other schools.Accusing the Alliance man of being ldquodisingenuous, Cllr Walker said his party is not anti-integrated education.In addition, he rejected Cllr Brownrsquos assertion that Newry, Mourne and Down Council did not want to meet with the Mid Down steering group to discuss its proposal.ldquoIt was agreed that steering group members, along with representatives from the other post-primary schools in the area who have concern about the new college proposal, would be asked to meet with a working group comprising elected representatives to outline their respective views, he said.Cllr Walker said that whatever happened moving forward, childrenrsquos education must always come first as they are the future of the district.He continued: ldquoThe bottom line for me is thatthe proposed Mid Down College impacts on existing schools, I will continue to point that out. We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do. The question I have for Cllr Brown is, has he done likewise .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_TUV.jpg","title":"‘Traditional Unionist’  McKee joins TUV weeks after his UUP departure  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has its first TUV councillor.Harold McKee mdash who recently quit the UUP over concerns about the leadership of the party under Doug Beattie mdash had intended to become an Independent member of the local authority, but has instead joined the TUV.The veteran Mournes councillor and former South Down MLA, says joining Jim Allisterrsquos party presents him with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people across his electoral area.This week, Cllr McKee has thanked the many people who have wished him well on his departure from the UUP and his political direction into the future.He explained that since announcing his resignation, he received an overwhelming number of positive messages of support on social media and via phone calls.ldquoI would take this opportunity to thank all those who took the time to message and telephone me, not only local people in Newry Mourne and Down, but also across the whole of Northern Ireland, said Cllr McKee.ldquoIt is often the case when a member leaves a political party that they receive offers from other parties to have a chat with members or indeed the leader to discuss potential future membership.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park. There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Agreement on the draft lease came at a recent meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillors High Gallagher and Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said plans to signicantly invest in the park will be a ldquogame changer for the South Down area.He said the cocktail of funding which has been secured to finance the revitalisation project will transform the built and natural heritage of the sprawling forest park andact as a huge pull for visitors to the area.Cllr Gallagher said he was delighted that the lease issue had been resolved and that the project was progressing.ldquoAs a Castlewellan councillor, this project is huge and will bring so much benefit to the wider area, he continued.ldquoThis same lease confirmed that the very popular lsquotouring in the treesrsquo permit for touring caravan owners will remain in Forest Service control until the end of . This was an issue that was raised with me and many local businesses in Castlewellan.Cllr Gallagher said that after , the local authority will assume responsibility for lsquotouring in the treesrsquo and that the local authorityrsquos senior management team recognises the importance of this longstanding tradition continuing.Cllr Devlin said that as a Castlewellan resident and a member of the forest park revitalisation project board, agreeing the draft lease represented a huge step, one she described as ldquohugely signicant.She added: ldquoThis project has been underway for many years and so much work, time and effort has been exerted by council officers, all of the ious agencies, elected members and project board chairperson Sally Montgomery.ldquoTo see all of this work now materialise is superb. I more or less grew up in the forest park as a child and it was so disheartening to see its deterioration over the years so this is one particular project that I am very excited about.Cllr Devlin extended a ldquohuge thanks to everyone who played a signicant part in getting the project to this stage and looks forward to seeing further developments on the ground..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Lions go contactless  ","story":"NEWCASTLE Lions Club have invested in a mobile contactless card payment device for use with their Christmas collections.The card reader was purchased with donations from Lions members and will ensure that % of all donations will go to charity.Club president Liz Murphy hopes themachine will be a success and stresses that the mobile card payment will be set for a pound donation.The card reader card can be used as a contactless or pin number device.

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede.

Contributors include Lord Trimble, Graham Gudgin, Ray Bassett, Mike Nesbitt, Jeff Dudgeon and News Letter editor Ben Lowry. There is a foreword by Baroness Hoey. The book is available for £. through Blackstaff Press, Amazon and bookshopsAt the back of the dust jacket for ‘The Idea of the Union’ the bottom strap line compares the intellectual case for maintaining the link with the rest of the UK to a fully drawn out test series.“Irish separatist nationalism has had a fair innings. Now it’s time for reason and reality to go to bat,” the editors tell the reader.Twenty contributors go to the crease to hit home the runs for the union in a book which turns out to be as fascinating, eclectic and strategically adept as the first  of any battle-hardened veteran international test cricketing outfit.The collection edited by academics John Wilson Foster and William Beattie Smith  also contain both politico-economic fast and spin bowlers who are capable of dismissing nationalist assumptions as efficiently as the world’s best bowler Trent Boult can dispatch New Zealand’s opponents from the field.The former first mininster of Northern Ireland Lord Trimble. All three leaders of unionism should read this book, and they should certainly read Lord Trimble’s contribution and take heed of his prophetic warning towards the end of itOne of the highlights of this ‘innings’ from the pro-union end of the pavilion comes from the economist Dr Graham Gudgin. His chapter is a particularly devastating ‘over’ that bowls out some of the new smug notions about the Republic’s economy. Dr Gudgin takes to task southern economists who point to higher Irish GDP and the supposed integration of an all island economy as reasons why people would be better off joining an all-Ireland entity rather than opt for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK. On the supposed all island economy Dr Gudgin sticks to facts such as only  per cent of Northern Ireland’s exports going south to the Republic and only  per cent of ROI output of goods and services going into Northern Ireland.Dr Gudgin also argues cogently that living standards in Northern Ireland remain higher in the Republic eventhe latter has one of the highest Gross Domestic Product figures in the EU. He berates those Dublin based economists who do not factor into their calculations the fact that prices especially house prices are far cheaper in the north than the south. Which means households in Northern Ireland get more goods and services still for any given amount of spending.“The result is staggering. It means that after  years as a tax haven and  years inside the EU, the Republic of Ireland has not managed to raise the living standards of its people to Northern Ireland levels,“ Dr Gudgin notes.His deployment of economic facts and statistics is apposite because other essayists in this collection contend that the battleground to save the union must be shted from the traditional ones of faith and crown to hard-headed socio-economic arguments for remaining in the UK.Several deal with the biggest public opinion paradox in Northern Ireland: a falling vote for unionist parties in elections and a consistent majority support for the union in every credible, scientically based opinion poll.In contrast to Gudgin’s forensic demolition of the economics of a united Ireland, David Trimble’s essay is surprisingly painful and personal. It is laced with a sense of betrayal regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Nobel peace prize winner’s anguish over Boris Johnson’s post Brexit betrayal of unionists is encapsulated in two emotionally charged passages on page  which are worth replicating here:“Despite strong opposition within my own community who resented the concessions to those engaged in indiscriminate killing. I campaigned for a Yes vote in the referendum on the Agreement, arguing that it made the Union safe and the future of Northern Ireland was totally in the hands of its people through the ballot box. They put their trust in my assurances and gave me and the Agreement their backing.“That is why I feel betrayed personally by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and it is also why the unionist population is so incensed at its imposition. The Protocol rips the very heart out of the Agreement.”Leaving aside his own distress over the fate of the Belfast Agreement he helped shape and bring into being in , Trimble’s essay is the first detailed analysis of the legal implications of the protocol. Forever the lawyer he reminds the reader that the EU laws which Northern Ireland will have to comply with runs to  pages and contains hundreds of thousands of regulations. Trimble also points out that these future EU imposed laws will govern nearly  per cent of Northern Irish economic activity.All three leaders of unionism should read this book and use it as a tool to rethink their political strategies into the next few decades. Perhaps those in power in London, Dublin and Brussels also might care to dip into this challenging series of essaysthey really want to understand the dangerous tensions bubbling just below the surface of post-Brexit Northern Ireland.They should certainly read Lord Trimble’s contribution and take heed of his prophetic warning towards the end of it.“So, far from keeping the peace, the protocol risks ato violence despite claims from its supporters that it is all about protecting the Agreement.”• ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ is edited by John Wilson Foster and William Beattie Smith.

The main health unions vehemently oppose mandatory vaccination while the Health Minister Robin Swann won’t even agree that patients and their families have the right to ask which staff in a particular care home or hospital are not vaccinated.”It is striking how politics, medicine and much of the media in NI was uncritical of lockdown, yet are reticent around jab compulsion for health and care staff.Dr Tom Black recently talked on BBC Radio Ulster of the need to be respectful of arguments on both sides.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere we break down how Cardf and Vale University Health Board has performed in October .Ambulance response timesCardf and Vale had the highest emergency response rates in October according to the latest Welsh Government NHS Wales Performance data.For the health board,  lsquoredrsquo calls ndash calls which are for immediately le-threatening incidents ndash were received in October, with an emergency response sent out in  of these cases.Of these,  were at the scene to treat the patient within the Welsh Governmentrsquos eight-minute target. This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A motion to ban MPs from holding second jobs outside parliament as paid lobbyists or political consultants has failed. MPs voted by a majority of  votes to reject the motion which had been put forward by the Labour Party following the recent Tory sleaze row and the government’s handling of the Owen Paterson case. Boris Johnson had instructed his MPs to vote against the Labour motion, with a following Conservative amendment passing through a majority of  votes. Labour leader Keir Starmer announced that the party would be tabling a motion to call for a ban on MPs being able to hold “any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant”. It came after huge backlash over the Owen Paterson row and the accusation that the Conservative government had ed to a policy of “sleaze”. Johnson had previously instructed Tory MPs to vote against the immediate suspension of former MP Owen Paterson, who had been found by the parliamentary standards committee to have broken lobbying rules while working as a consultant and earning £, per year. The committee had recommended that Paterson serve a -day suspension, however his suspension was initially blocked after a vote in the House of Commons, where a reform of the parliamentary standards committee was also voted through. The government was forced to do a hard u-turn on blocking Paterson’s suspension following intense backlash from opposition parties and the public, with critics claiming that the incident had heralded ato “Tory sleaze”. As a result of the incident, Labour took the opportunity to table a motion which banned the paid employment of MPs in positions consultancy and advisory role outside of parliament. At a vote in the House of Commons on  November, the motion was rejected by  votes to . Despite rejecting the motion with a majority of  votes, the vote showed that Boris Johnson’s majority on the issue had decreased. Many Tory MPs abstained from voting against the controversial motion, while four Conservative MPs - Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone, Nigel Mills and Dan Poulter - rebelled against the party and voted in favour of the ban on certain kinds of second jobs. Upon the announcement that a Labour backed motion calling for a ban on paid lobbying and consultancy role for MP would be tabled, Johnson tabled an amendment. The amendment described the ban as “the basis of a viable approach” and called on the Standards Committee to update the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Labour called the motion a “watered down” version of the original amendment. Despite the original motion being rejected, the amendment passed with  votes to zero, with Labour MPs abstaining from the second vote. A Government spokesperson said: “The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.“This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.“This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.”Following the vote and rejection of the Labour motion, Starmer said: “We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics.“Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesn’t get.”“We are not going to back down from these proposals, we’re not prepared to have them watered down, so we will press on with them.“But it is unbelievable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"junior reporter needed to interview the fureys ","story":"MPs back government’s ‘watered down’ plans on second jobs last seen in Craigavon area\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news people ethan-carville-missing-boy--last-seen-in-craigavon-area- itm_sourceparsely-api\" data-el\"right\" data-s-el\"right\" data-direction\"right\"    last seen in Craigavon area\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news people ethan-carville-missing-boy--last-seen-in-craigavon-area- itm_sourceparsely-api\" data-el\"left\" data-s-el\"right\" data-direction\"right\"Ethan Carville: Missing boylast seen in Craigavon areaNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleJunior reporter needed to interview The FureysWe’re on the lookout for a junior reporter interested in the unique assignment of interviewing members of top Irish folk band, The Fureys.By Valerie MartinMonday, th November , : am  \"       \"  The Fureys, will be performing at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Saturday, January  and in advance of this showpiece event, we are giving one young person a unique opportunity to interview Eddie and George Furey from the band.The interview will take place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday, December .
