Officials warned at the time this would likely trigger an uptick.But the test positivity rate — the proportion of tests that detect the virus — has also doubled suggesting there is a real-terms increase in cases. The Government-run National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said that detected cases and the percentage testing positive are \u0027increasing quickly\u0027 in three of the country\u0027s provinces including Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria.A cluster outbreak was recently identified, concentrated at a higher education institute in the capital Pretoria, the NICD said.Last year South Africa also detected the Beta variant of the virus, although until now its infection numbers have been driven by the Delta variant, which was originally detected in India.The country has the highest pandemic numbers in Africa with around 2.95million cases, of which 89,657 have been fatal. After a rather slow start to South Africa\u0027s vaccination campaign, around 41 percent of adults have received at least a single dose, while 35 percent are fully vaccinated.WHO officials said its Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) was assessing the variant.They will be convening a meeting tomorrow to determine whether the variant should be marked as being of concern — the highest alert category — or of interest — meaning monitoring of the variant will be ratcheted up.In a glimmer of hope, however, British experts told MailOnline yesterday that the extensive mutations might work against the virus, making it \u0027unstable\u0027. The first case was identified in Botswana on November 11, and it was picked up in South Africa the following day. A case was also spotted in Hong Kong on November 13 in a 36-year-old man who had travelled back from South Africa on November 11.In South Africa it has been officially spotted in the Gauteng, Limpopo and North West provinces.Worldwide it has been detected 100 times so far, but experts warn there are likely many more cases. World Health Organization officials said the majority were in South Africa. Dr Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, who first sounded the alarm about its spread, described the variant\u0027s combination of mutations as \u0027horrific\u0027.He warned that B.1.1.529 had the potential to be \u0027worse than nearly anything else about\u0027.    Professor David Livermore, a microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline the Botswana variant concerned him because of its \u0027very extensive\u0027 set of mutations. He said: \u0027This increases the risk of vaccine escape, but doesn\u0027t prove that it will occur. \u0027Nor is the strain\u0027s infectiousness clear, and it too will be affected by the spike\u0027s structure.\u0027The Botswana variant carries mutations K417N and E484A that are similar to those on the South African \u0027Beta\u0027 variant that made it better able to dodge vaccines.But it also has the N440K, found on Delta, and S477N, on the New York variant, which are also linked to antibody escape. The variant also has mutations P681H and N679K which are \u0027rarely seen together\u0027 and could make it yet more jab resistant. And the mutation N501Y that makes viruses more transmissible and was previously seen on the Kent \u0027Alpha\u0027 variant and Beta among others.Other mutations it has include G446S, T478K, Q493K, G496S, Q498R and Y505H, although their significance is not yet clear.Dr Meera Chand, from the UKHSA, said: \u0027The UK Health Security Agency, in partnership with scientific bodies across the globe, is constantly monitoring the status of SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge and develop worldwide. \u0027As it is in the nature of viruses to mutate often and at random, it is not unusual for small numbers of cases to arise featuring new sets of mutations. Any variants showing evidence of spread are rapidly assessed.\u0027 It comes as Covid cases continued to rise across the UK but deaths and hospitalisations still firmly trended downwards.Another 43,676 cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours, a rise of 14.1 per cent on the 38,263 confirmed positive cases last Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"McDonalds worker shines light reveal mass WORMS inside soft drinks machine","story":"Share this articleMcDonald\u0027s customers disgusted as worms seen in drinks machine at South London restaurant - MyLondon"},{"url":null,"title":"Spectator names Rishi Sunak parliamentarian year new sign Chancellors political rise","story":"Share this article Meanwhile, Downing Street has sought to play down reports of tensions between Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak.The Times reported that Mr Sunak was becoming increasingly frustrated with the \u0027chaotic\u0027 operation in No 10.The newspaper said the Chancellor\u0027s chief of staff, Liam Booth-Smith, was being blamed for briefing that there was \u0027a lot of concern in the building\u0027 about Mr Johnson.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman insisted that the teams in No 10 and No 11, where the Chancellor is based, \u0027continue to work together very well at all levels\u0027.Asked if the Prime Minister had confidence in Mr Booth-Smith, the spokesman said: \u0027Of course, the Prime Minister has confidence in the team at No 11.

London had the lowest rate with just 8,813 cases estimated per day in the capital — a rate of one in 81 people. Meanwhile the UKHSA data showed  the number of positive cases overall increased by eight per cent from 223,000 in the week ending November 14 to last week."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"pfizer vaccine immunity starts to wane 90 days after second dose study","story":"Over five million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been administered in IrelandExperts who have been tracking the effectiveness of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine have found that the risk of Covid infection begins to increase 90 days after people had a second dose.The study backs up the need for booster doses to prevent people suffering breakthrough infections as immunity wanes, according to the team, who published their findings in the British Medical Journal (BMJ).Over five million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been administered in Ireland, making it the main vaccine used here. However, booster doses are only given here five months after the second dose.Experts from the Research Institute of Leumit Health Services in Israel found a gradual increase in the risk of Covid-19 infection from 90 days after people received a second dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.Israel was one of the first countries to roll out a large scale Covid-19 vaccination campaign in December 2020, but has been battling a resurgence in infections and has been looking closely at waning immunity.The experts examined electronic health records for 80,057 adults (with an average age of 44) who had a PCR test between mid-May and September at least three weeks after their second vaccine injection.None of the people in the sample had evidence of previous Covid-19 infection.Of the group of 80,057 people, 7,973 (9.6 per cent) had a positive test result.They were then matched to people of the same age and ethnic group who tested negative in the same week.The study found that the rate of positive results was found to rise in line with the time since people had had their second dose.Across all age groups, 1.3 per cent of people tested positive 21-89 days after a second dose, but this increased to 2.4 per cent after 90-119 days 4.6 per cent after 120-149 days 10.3 per cent after 150-179 days and 15.5 per cent after 180 days or more.Compared with the first 90 days after a second dose, the risk of infection across all age groups was 2.37-fold higher after 90-119 days 2.66-fold higher after 120-149 days 2.82-fold higher after 150-179 days and 2.82-fold higher after 180 days or more.While the study is observational in nature, the experts said it appears clear that immunity wanes after the first three months of being double-vaccinated.They said: “Large scale Covid-19 vaccination campaigns can achieve control over the spread of the virus, but even in countries with high vaccination rates, breakthrough infections can occur.“The risk of (Covid) infection in adults who received two vaccine injections increased with time elapsed since vaccination compared with the reference (iniduals vaccinated in the last 90 days).”AstraZeneca has said antibody protection from its vaccine also wanes, although its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said on Tuesday that the jab is thought to offer long-term T-cell immunity for older people, which could be better than other vaccines. –PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"walk in booster vaccination clinics to open for people aged 60 to 69","story":"     The HSE said that mass vaccination centres would open to those over 50 who are over five months since their second dose.The HSE has started offering walk-in clinics for Covid-19 booster vaccines to people in their 60s and to healthcare workers at designated times through its vaccination centres.In a speed-up of the booster programme, the walk-in clinics will be available to eligible groups once it has been at least five months since their second dose of a Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca jab in their initial vaccinations, or three months since the inidual received the single Janssen vaccine. It comes as the Department of Health said that there have been 4,764 confirmed cases of Covid19. As of 8am today, 598 Covid-19 patients are hospitalised, of which 126 are in ICU.Damien McCallion, the HSE’s national lead for vaccinations and testing, said that many of the 470,000 people in their 60s will only become eligible for boosters over the coming weeks.The walk-in clinics will allow the HSE to administer booster doses more quickly. Details of the times and locations of the walk-in vaccinations are available on the HSE’s website. “We are very conscious that life has moved on for many people and it isn’t always possible for people to come forward on an appointment basis,” he told the weekly HSE briefing.Turned awayMr McCallion said that people will be turned away from vaccination centres if they are not in one of the eligible groups and five months have not elapsed since their second primary dose.The HSE has been offering appointments by calling people in their 60s to receive their booster jabs at vaccination centres and has vaccinated about 48,000 people so far. GPs may also refer some people aged 70 years and over to vaccination centres for boosters.The booster vaccination programme is currently being offered to people aged 60 and over, residents of long-term residential care facilities and healthcare workers.Third vaccine doses are being given to about 100,000 immunocompromised people. The Government has agreed to extend booster doses to about 620,000 people aged between 50 and 59 but they will only start receiving booster doses from mid-December, the HSE said. Mr McCallion said that the HSE expected to start administering booster doses to the medically vulnerable people next week. There are an estimated 489,000 people in this group, but this includes immunocompromised people, almost 75,000 of whom have already received third doses. HSE chief executive Paul Reid said that about 600,000 booster doses have been administered so far. There were about 192,000 vaccines administered last week.He said the HSE would step up to between 200,000 and 250,000 boosters a week and eventually 270,000 a week through GPs and pharmacies but primarily through vaccination centres. Mr Reid said that there were currently 598 people in hospital with Covid-19 - down 7 per cent on last week. This included 126 in intensive care units. There have been 395 admissions of Covid-19 patients to hospital over the past seven days, up 29 per cent on the previous week.Mr McCallion said that people in their 70s and 80s have been receiving booster doses through their GPs but that the vaccination centres would start “to get moving” as the number of people becoming eligible for the boosters jabs increases significantly over the coming weeks. Most people in their 60s and 70s would become eligible for boosters before Christmas, he said. He could not provide a figure on the number who would have to wait until after Christmas.Asked about what people in older age groups should do at Christmas if they haven’t received their vaccine boosters, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said that the general advice for everyone was to reduce their contacts and follow basic health measures over the coming weeks.Meanwhile, the latest official figures on coronavirus deaths from the HSE show a further 18 people died from Covid-19 last week. This brings to 5,652 the number of deaths from the coronavirus over the course of the pandemic, according to the weekly report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The HPSC said that the 18 deaths were people who died between November 17th and 23rd and do not include deaths reported during that period but with an earlier date of death. Additional deaths occurring during the past week may yet be reported to the HPSC, the HSE unit that tracks the extent and impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the State.The National Public Health Emergency Team said on Wednesday that there were 43 newly notified deaths related to Covid-19 over the past week. This figure includes deaths with an earlier date of death prior to the previous week. The HPSC figures show the number of weekly deaths has fallen steadily over the past three weeks, from 25 in the first week of November to 22 in the second week of the month. The mean age of the most recent deaths was 63 and the median age was 66.Separately, Northern Ireland’s Department of Health said that a further five people with Covid-19 have died there and 1,549 additional cases have been confirmed.A total of 396 patients are receiving hospital treatment for Covid-19, with 35 in intensive care. Fourth waveIn this fourth wave of the pandemic, there have been 112 deaths from Covid-19 in the Republic this month, compared with 198 during the month of October and 175 in September.Of the total 5,652 deaths during the pandemic, 3,017 - or 53 per cent - have been men and 2,635 - or 47 per cent - have been women. Some 85 per cent had an underlying health condition. Just over 11 per cent, or 656 people who died, had been admitted to intensive care. Where their working status was known, 19 of the people who died were healthcare workers. The majority of the deaths have been in older age groups, with 41 per cent of fatalities occurring among those aged 85 and over, 33 per cent in the 75- to 84-year-old age group and 16 per cent in the 65- to 74-year-old age group. People ranging in age from 14 to 105 had died from the virus. Some 1.2 per cent of deaths, or 66 people, were people aged 44 and younger. Overall, the median age was 82 and mean age was 80.Just over half of all deaths, 2,884 people, took place in a hospital and a further 36 per cent occurred in a residential institution such as a nursing home, community hospital or long-stay unit. Among the 3,578 deaths linked to Covid-19 outbreaks, 62 per cent occurred in nursing homes, 24 per cent in hospitals and 4 per cent in community hospitals and long-stay units. January 2021, the peak of the third wave of the pandemic, was the worst month for Covid-19 deaths with 1,420 people dying that month, followed by April 2020 when there were 1,161 deaths.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere is still “quite a big gap” between the EU and the UK in the dispute over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade rules, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said. The Minister told the Seanad Brexit committee that there was “a lot at stake over the next few weeks” given the potential “carryover” for the EU-UK trade deal to be affected if the London government decides to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland protocol over the row.The EU has warned that the protocol and trade agreement were “inextricably linked” and that it would respond “very robustly” to the suspension of parts of the protocol under Article 16.Brussels would regard this “as a fairly serious breach of good faith,” said Mr Coveney. “That is the last place any of us want to be, particularly in Ireland or in the UK,” he said.Mr Coveney said that there was a chance “to seize momentum” toward finding a compromise in EU-UK negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute over the protocol but that it required “a much more positive, much more stable, much more trusting EU-UK relationship.”“We have some way to go to get there,” he added.The EU and the UK are locked in negotiations in a bid to break the deadlock over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it creates a trade barrier between Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government is seeking changes to the protocol and has threatened to trigger the Article 16 clause of the protocol to suspend parts of its operation if it is not changed. Under the protocol, Northern Ireland remains under EU trade rules for goods. Mr Coveney told Independent senator Michael McDowell that the UK government’s request for all goods coming from Britain sold in Northern Ireland to be exempt from all checks and customs declarations was “a very difficult thing for the EU to deliver.” The EU can “go a long way” to reduce those checks significantly, he said, referring to the EU’s proposals to reduce food checks by 80 per cent and customs checks by 50 per cent.Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost had “shown a lot of scepticism” on whether these proposals are possible but Mr Coveney said the EU’s Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic and his team were “very clear and strong” that they can deliver on those proposals. The UK “has got to give something here too”, said Mr Coveney.On the prospect of a compromise being reached, he said he was “more hopeful than I was a fortnight ago.”Mr Coveney described Lord Frost as a “good and tough negotiator” and that the British negotiating tactic has been “very successful in terms of delivering concessions and flexibility from the EU” but it has not been successful in terms of “reputation and relationships.” The Minister said the way the UK government had behaved over the last 10 months had “put a lot of strain” on relationships, between the EU and the UK, between the Ireland and the UK and, at times, between the UK and the US given the responses from the White House and Capitol Hill.However, he said he was very anxious to focus on “the limited but nevertheless limited progress of the last 10 days or so.”He said the Government wanted to maximise the opportunities in the post-Brexit trade deal agreed by the EU and UK and to develop the future relationship with the UK positively.“In order to achieve this, the parties must work together, in a spirit of partnership and trust. When trust is compromised, progress is threatened,” said Mr Coveney.“The recent UK approach to the protocol has unfortunately called that trust into question. I believe, however, that there is an opportunity before us now to seize momentum toward agreeing a constructive way forward.” How is Brexit affecting you?

Video: EU CommissionThe nine-month period reflects scientific advice that the first round of vaccines wanes after six months, adding three months to allow governments to establish  booster programmes. Photograph: iStockPeople living in the European Union who want to travel around the bloc without being tested or going into quarantine should get a Covid booster jab nine months after their original vaccination, the European Commission has proposed.The EU’s executive body said there should be a standard nine-month acceptance period for vaccines across the bloc, in an attempt to do away with a confusing mix of rules across the 27 member states. The commission is also expected to propose similar measures for travellers coming into the EU. The nine-month period reflects scientific advice that the first round of vaccines wanes after six months, adding three months to allow governments to get booster-shot programmes up and running.Both draft laws would have to be approved by EU member states before coming into force, which is expected in 2022.Didier Reynders, the EU commissioner for justice, described the policy as a move to a person-based approach, rather than classifying travellers purely by their country of departure.Under the plans, cross-border commuters, lorry drivers and children under 12 would continue to be exempt from travel rules, although the list of exempt groups has been reduced.StrategyUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, urged European citizens to get vaccinated, after EU health agencies recommended booster jabs earlier this week as part of a strategy to stem a surge in infections.Von der Leyen, a trained medical doctor, said: “A quarter of EU adults are still not fully vaccinated. If you are unvaccinated, you are more at risk of having severe Covid-19 symptoms. Vaccination protects you, and the others.”France said on Thursday it would make Covid-19 booster shots available to all adults, toughen rules on wearing face masks and ramp-up health pass checks as it seeks to curb a fifth wave of infections that risks undermining its economic recovery.The number of infections is doubling every 11 days in France, but officials said there was no need to follow European countries such as Austria that have reimposed lockdowns.The French health minister, Olivier Veran, said anyone aged 18 or over would be eligible for booster jabs and that the period between full vaccination and the booster shots would be shortened to five months instead of six.Veran said France currently held about 25 million vaccine doses, enough to accelerate the booster campaign. Booster shots are currently available only to over-65s and to those with underlying health issues. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hse plans covid vaccine for children aged 5 11 as eu regulator approves use","story":"It is seen as unlikely the vaccine will be administered to primary school children here before the new year. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe HSE is stepping up its planning on how it will vaccinate children between the ages of five and 11 after the EU’s drug regulator approved use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for that age group.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in children aged between five and 11.The EMA has said the under-12s should get a lower dose of the vaccine than teenagers and adults.The move paves the way for Ireland’s National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to consider the rollout of the vaccine to children here. It is understood the special shots for children will not be delivered to Ireland until around December 20th, and it is seen as unlikely that the vaccine will be administered to primary school children here before the new year. Paul Reid, the chief executive of the HSE, said that it welcomed today’s decision of the European Medicines Agency to extend vaccinations to younger age groups and awaited sign-off from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on the vaccinations for younger children.“Our understanding is that the delivery of those vaccines right across Europe will be towards the end of December, so what we will be doing in the meantime is mobilising a plan and the channels in which we would prepare the vaccinaion of those younger age groups,” he told the HSE’s weekly Covid-19 briefing. RolloutDamien McCallion, the HSE’s national lead for vaccinations, said that they had already started preliminary planning about how it would vaccinate the estimated 480,000 children in this group.He said the rollout would depend on what other vaccinations were taking place at the time but that it planned to start vaccinations “as quickly as possible” after delivery of the vaccines.Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only being administered to people aged 12 and over.The development comes as the latest figures show primary school-aged children now have the highest Covid-19 incidence of any age group in Ireland, with some 10,000 positive cases in the past fortnight. The vaccine, as with older age groups, is given as two injections in the muscles of the upper arm, three weeks apart. The EMA said the main study among children aged five to 11 showed the immune response to the Pfizer (Comirnaty) vaccine, given at a lower dose (10 µg) in this age group, was comparable to that seen with the higher dose (30 µg) in 16- to 25-year-olds as measured by the level of antibodies against Sars-Co V-2. The most common side effects in children aged five to 11 are similar to those in people aged 12 and above. They include pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, redness and swelling at the site of injection, muscle pain and chills. The EMA said: “These effects are usually mild or moderate and improve within a few days of vaccination.”It added that its human medicines committee “therefore concluded that the benefits of Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 outweigh the risks, particularly in those with conditions that increase the risk of severe Covid-19”.The EMA said: “The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in both children and adults will continue to be monitored closely as it is used in vaccination campaigns in EU Member states.”Dr Clíona Ní Cheallaigh, consultant in general medicine and infectious diseases consultant at St James’s Hospital in Dublin, told RTÉ’s Brendan O’Connor that the news from the EMA was a “brilliant” development.“The initial data that has come out looks like it works well. It is about 90 per cent effective in the time period they looked at at preventing Covid infection in children and they didn’t detect any serious side effects in children that were in the study so that is really good news.”Dr Ní Cheallaigh said she also feels that the wearing of masks among young primary school children is inevitable.Marco Cavaleri, Head of Biological Health Threats and Vaccines Strategy at EMA, said he was pleased to announce the approval of the vaccine for young children. Meanwhile, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Thursday said it is important not to rush into a decision in relation to possible new restrictions, stressing it was important to stay positive.Although the virus is not under control currently and the situation in ICUs was “worrying”, the Tánaiste said there were reasons to be hopeful.In relation to making a decision about whether to introduce new measures to combat the fourth wave of the virus, Mr Varadkar stressed he did not want to speculate. “We need another week or so to see where we are going,” he said.Efforts are being put into getting people who have been hesitant about taking the vaccine to go for their first dose, he said. The Tánaiste is also encouraging the public to attend for their booster vaccine if it is offered to them. ‘Three-dose vaccine’“It is becoming increasingly clear that this is a three-dose vaccine,” he said.Mr Varadkar acknowledged the issues around obtaining PCR tests but stated the HSE has done a “phenomenal job with testing”, with current rates at about 30,000 tests per day. He said he was in favour of antigen tests but warned people they need a PCR test if they have symptoms. He said a decision has been made to subsidise the test and that the details are being ironed out. Mr Varadkar said a requirement for primary-school children to wear face masks was under consideration, acknowledging it would be “very hard” to ask young children to wear masks.The move is also expected to be discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) when it meets on Thursday.Kingston Mills, professor of experimental immunology at Trinity College Dublin, on Thursday said mask wearing among children would lower infection. However, he said getting young children to wear masks is “going to be challenging”.Speaking ahead of the EMA announcement regarding vaccine use for children aged five to 11, Prof Mills said a significant number of children had been vaccinated already in the United States and Israel.When asked to comment on parents who are wary of their children receiving a vaccine, Prof Kingston told Newstalk Breakfast it was up to every family to consider its position on the matter.On balance, the risk of getting the vaccine is less than the risk of getting Covid, said Prof Mills. In most children, Covid-19 is very mild, but for some it can persist for months, he said.Prof Mary Horgan, Nphet member and president of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, on Thursday said it has been known for the past few months that the increase of infection in primary-school children is higher than the rest of the population.“Probably for two reasons or many reasons. Firstly they are a group that haven’t been vaccinated,” she said, adding the age group still does not use masks, while the rest of the population does.Prof Horgan said she hoped Ireland can avoid a lockdown: “A lockdown is just a blunt instrument, and it is really the last resort. We have developed loads of tools that we need to effectively use to avoid a lockdown. The current situation in hospitals is steady.”Although Prof Mills said Ireland was not moving quickly enough with its booster-vaccination campaign, Prof Horgan said the rollout of booster vaccines is “a big operation”.“I believe it is being done as quickly as possible,” said Prof Horgan. She said the benefits of boosters were being seen already.Public transportMeanwhile, the trade union Siptu called on the Government to reduce capacity on public transport amid a surge in Covid-19 numbers.“We can’t have overcrowded buses and not expect to have overcrowded hospitals as well due to higher infection rates,” Siptu transport organiser John Murphy told Newstalk Breakfast.The trade union wrote to Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan on Wednesday urging the Government to reduce passenger capacity from 100 per cent. The union represents 4,500 staff who work on all forms of public transport. – Additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"government set to spend a few hundred thousand before deciding on world cup bid","story":"The Department of Tourism and Sport has said that nothing has been spent on the World Cup proposal so far but there is a financial commitment to scoping out the possibility of a bid. Photograph: iStock The Government expects to spend “a few hundred thousand” on scoping out a bid to host the 2030 football World Cup before deciding whether or not to proceed.The estimate for the cost of deciding on officially proceeding with a bid along with the United Kingdom was provided to the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The potential joint bid is being considered by both governments.Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy raised questions about the cost of attracting major sporting events with senior officials from the Department of Tourism and Sport at the PAC on Thursday.Funding for attracting major sporting events to Ireland will be €6.4 million next year after an extra €400,000 was allocated for this in the budget.Cian Ó Lionáin, the department’s assistant secretary general for tourism and sport, has said that nothing has been spent on the World Cup proposal so far but there is a financial commitment to scoping out the possibility of a bid.“We reckon that by next summer a few hundred thousand will have been spent on that. At that point Government will need to take the decision as to whether to proceed with the bid,” he said.The Government has advertised for a “suitably qualified candidate” to lead Irish efforts as the proposal is being assessed.The closing date applications for the role – where experience on the football field as an international player or coach is “desirable” – is Friday.The successful candidate will not be paid but will see their expenses covered as they attend meetings of the board of the newly established company UK \u0026amp Ireland 2030 Limited which will generally be held in Wembley.The company is to complete a feasibility study and advise on whether there should be a bid and if a decision is taken to proceed, the company will pursue and oversee the process to its conclusion.Ryder CupMr Ó Lionáin said that €3.2 million has been spent so far on the 2027 Ryder Cup which is to be held in Adare Manor, Co Limerick. The PAC was told that the Ryder Cup in 2006 – the last time the tournament was held in Ireland – was worth €143 million to the economy, €7 million more than the pre-event predictions. A study also showed that more than 80 per cent of visitors on that occasion suggested they would return to Ireland in the future.Ms Murphy also asked about spending on the proposal for Cork to host the America’s Cup yacht race.Mr Ó Lionáin said the department is in the middle of a six-month assessment process on that event and that the “expenditure to date is effectively staff time”.He said: “There will probably be some expenditure then on economic and other specific appraisals and the intention is to have that piece of work finished by the end of March, early April.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Officials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissenters"},{"url":null,"title":"time world let foxy knoxy go free","story":"Until this week, did you recall the name Rudy Guede? Quite possibly not. Or Meredith Kercher? The name of the 21-year-old British student raped and murdered in Perugia, Italy, 14 years ago is probably more familiar.Now how about the name Amanda Knox, aka ‘Foxy Knoxy’? Chances are that you will not only know her name, but also the face of the slightly oddball American girl who was accused of murdering her friend in a “sex game gone wrong”.Knox is so inextricably linked to the events of November 1 2007 that the New York Post ran a headline last year saying: “Man Who Killed Amanda Knox’s Roommate Freed on Community Service.” The “man” in that headline was Guede, an habitual criminal who was convicted of murdering the “roommate”, Kercher and who, this week, has been controversially released from jail after serving just 13 years and six months of his 16-year sentence. Yet the public fascination with Knox is so intense that it is her name that remains shorthand for the horrific crime, with that of her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito – who also spent four years in prison before being acquitted by the Supreme Court in Rome – having become hardly more than a footnote. Even now photographers wait outside 34-year-old Knox’s house in Seattle, hoping to snap the first pictures of her with her baby daughter, named Eureka.Little wonder, then, that she has called on the newly freed Guede to confess to the crime – which he has always denied, despite DNA evidence – and clear her name once and for all. “Guede holds a tremendous power to heal others harmed by his actions. He has the power to tell the truth, to take responsibility, to stop blaming me for the rape and murder of Meredith Kercher, which a wealth of evidence shows he committed alone,” Knox wrote on Twitter this week.So is it time for us to let go of our fictionalised version of ‘Foxy Knoxy’ and allow married mother Knox to reclaim her life, and her name? Where can she go from here?According to Knox, “the controversy, not the truth, is what people care about more”, and the reason that controversy lingers on is that the Italian courts have never accepted Guede acted alone.Guede – who was arrested three weeks after the murder and convicted in a fast-track trial – holds in his hands the ability to clear Knox’s name once and for all. The Italian courts could, if they wanted, apologise for the four years she spent in prison and the eight-year legal process in which she was enmeshed, but to do so would be to admit to embarrassing flaws in the country’s legal system.Yet Italian prosecutors would not let go of a bizarre theory that detectives had formed from the off: that Kercher had been murdered because she refused to take part in a “sex game” with Knox and Sollecito. The pair were convicted of murder in 2009 in 2011 their convictions were quashed in 2013 a new trial was ordered, then in 2015 Italy’s Supreme Court exonerated them for good. Knox blames the police’s preferred scenario on a “misogynist fantasy” – one which so excited the public imagination that Matt Damon’s current thriller Stillwater is based on the Knox trial, and it also helped inspire new BBC drama Showtrial, both more than a decade on.She did not, it must be said, help herself in the way she behaved after the murder: having implicated an entirely innocent local man, bartender Patrick Lumumba in the crime. She was photographed kissing Sollecito in public, which was taken as evidence of her guilt – though she insists that she did not, contrary to reports at the time, perform a cartwheel in the local police station. In her 2013 autobiography, Waiting To Be Heard, Knox admits that she is not good at “social norms” and accepts that her behaviour could have been misconstrued.Nowadays, we are more aware of the sexist stereotypes that paint women as “she-devils” and “ice queens” – both accusations thrown at Knox during that time. Would she be treated differently now?Her detractors (and it must be said that the Kercher family has never explicitly accepted she is innocent) accuse her of hypocrisy in asking to be left alone. She has, after all, written a memoir, given numerous interviews to newspapers, television and radio, hosts her own podcast, and has reportedly negotiated exclusive rights for pictures of herself with her daughter, born earlier this year to husband, novelist Christopher Robinson. In her defence, Knox says that she needs the money to pay off her family’s huge legal bills, and that turning around her reputation by standing up to the critics – reclaiming her own story – is her only hope of freeing her daughter from the curse that follows her name. She could hardly, she has also pointed out, get a regular job given the press who still regularly follow her around. She is in touch with Monica Lewinsky, whom she regards as a fellow victim of misogyny in the early years of 24-hour rolling news and social media a woman who for decades was characterised as a guilty party despite being a young intern in thrall to the most powerful man in the world. A woman whose name is still used as shorthand for that scandal, rather than Bill Clinton’s. Twenty years on, Lewinsky has found a new voice campaigning against cyberbullying, in the same way that Knox now hopes to raise awareness of other victims of wrongful conviction.Knox, then, does not intend to disappear, saying this week in response to those who suggest that she changes her name: “My name is not wrong, they’re wrong about me.”“I am not Foxy Knoxy,” she insists – and it is this misinterpretation of her character that she wants to see off. The nickname, unearthed on her social media profile by a reporter, dated back to childhood and, she has always insisted, was given to her because of her wily skills as a footballer.Either way, her rhyming epithet was irresistible to headline writers, and has come to define her in the public eye. In Britain it marked her out as a vamp in Italy it was even more damaging, as the public associated it with fox-like cunning, the sort that would course through the veins of a murderer.“The prosecution and the media crafted a story, and a doppelgänger version of me, onto which people could affix all their uncertainties, fears and moral judgments. People liked that story: the psychotic man-eater, the dirty ice queen, Foxy Knoxy,” she has said. Strangers who sent her lingerie and love letters were, she adds, taken in by the “cardboard cut out” character. “Amanda’s out of prison, but she’s not out of the prison of public vilification,” her husband, Robinson, has explained.Rudy Guede is the only person who knows what happened that night, but he says he “just wants to be forgotten”. Unlike Amanda Knox, he is likely to be granted his wish.Additional reporting by Claudia RowanMore from NewsBBC and other media asked to avoid using ‘dehumanising’ words like ‘migrant’Emmanuel Macron clashes with Boris Johnson and warns him not to \u0026#39exploit a tragic situation for political ends\u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s busiest railway stations revealed as Waterloo loses top spot during pandemicPrince William tells emergency workers: \u0026#39Be the first responders for your own mental health\u0026#39Winter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains busiest railway stations revealed waterloo loses top","story":"Waterloo has lost its title as Britain\u0027s busiest railway station for the first time in 17 years, amid a fall in long distance commuting.Station footfall statistics from May 2020 to April 2021 showed that London’s Stratford station was the most visited during the pandemic.The figures come as train usage dropped to the lowest levels since Victorian times during the pandemic, with less than five per cent of the usual number of travellers on the railways at points during the lockdowns.Waterloo’s passenger figures plummeted from 87 million people in 201920 to just 12.2 million last year, ending its 17-year run as the UK’s busiest station.The latest statistics, compiled by the Office for Rail and Road (ORR), showed that Stratford emerged as the most visited station during the coronavirus crisis, with 14 million passengers.The ORR said Stratford attracted a relatively high number of passengers in lockdown because it is a hub for connecting between different lines. As well as a number of overground lines, the busy Jubilee and Central Tube lines run through the station. Stratford is also near some popular attractions, such as the Westfield shopping centre and the Olympic Park.Other stations to make the top 10 most busy list for the first time during the pandemic were all hubs for changing between different lines - such as Clapham Junction, with 8.7 million visitors, and Highbury and Islington, with 8.7 million.Feras Alshaker, director of planning and performance at the ORR, said: “We’ve seen a radical change, especially in London, in the stations people were using the most. Stratford, Highbury and Islington, Clapham Junction, Barking and East Croydon replaced Kings Cross, St Pancras, Euston and Paddington in the top 10, underlining their importance as vital stops and interchanges, linking key workers with underground and bus services to travel.”Outside London, the most used stations were Birmingham New Street, Leeds and Glasgow Central.More from NewsBBC and other media asked to avoid using ‘dehumanising’ words like ‘migrant’Emmanuel Macron clashes with Boris Johnson and warns him not to \u0026#39exploit a tragic situation for political ends\u0026#39Prince William tells emergency workers: \u0026#39Be the first responders for your own mental health\u0026#39Winter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?Geminid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont listen gloomsters cop26 british success","story":"The debate over Cop26 has prompted an explosion of talking heads, and the synergy between two groups of them is particularly curious. The radical wing of the climate protest group Extinction Rebellion seems to be in perfect harmony with staunch climate deniers, with both branding the climate negotiations a failure despite sitting at opposite extremes of mainstream politics. This isn’t a surprise, because successful climate diplomacy fits neither of their agendas. For radical protesters, diplomacy is too slow and involves careful compromise. For climate deniers, it works on a problem they pretend doesn’t exist. Both were always going to slam the outcome of the Glasgow summit. And yet, for people who trade on attention, both groups seem out of step with the public, for the public appetite for proper climate action is clearly growing. A recent YouGov survey found that the number of people rating the environment as a key issue facing the country has hit a historic high, with its importance standing in equal measure to the economy.Moreover, in positive news for the Government, the number of people who expect COP to have a successful outcome was higher at the end of the talks than at the beginning, and is highest of all among Conservative voters. Such optimism was not misplaced, since the Glasgow agreement did indeed turn out to be something of a success. Where the 2015 Paris Agreement set out the framework for slowing down global heating, Glasgow is forcing the world to pick up the pace. Just look at the hard numbers. Before Paris, we were on track for 6 degrees of warming. In the years that followed, we lowered that to 4 degrees. Before the Glasgow summit, we were on track for 2.7 degrees. Now estimates say we’re on track for between 2.4 degrees and 1.8 degrees. These numbers aren’t about temperatures gently rising and falling on a summer’s day. If this planet warms by 4 degrees, ice sheets will melt and virtually all coastal cities will be inundated. At 3 degrees, farmers’ food yields fall rapidly and marine ecosystems are likely to collapse. Every fraction of a degree matters, and the Glasgow agreement has successfully bent down the curve.Thanks to the extraordinary abilities of British diplomats, this is the first time that a reduction in coal use has been mentioned in an international agreement. They have brought India more into the fold, signing them up to an ambitious decarbonisation plan which includes a commitment to generate 50 per cent of its electricity from renewables by 2030.It’s time to ditch the defeatist, fatalistic idea that there’s no point in Britain going through such pains when other countries pollute more. Our country is one of the most influential in the world, and where we lead on climate, others follow. We can change world emissions through our finance, influence, and diplomacy. Since Britain became the first country to set out a detailed net-zero strategy, much of the Western world — and even China and India — have followed suit. Britain was also a first mover on ending overseas fossil fuel finance. Now, scores of other countries are doing the same, including China and America. Thus for all the shouting from the sidelines, this country’s environmental campaigns have proven to be a success. I would caution the small number of MPs who might be tempted to talk this down that in doing so they would not only be wrong, but unpatriotic. They would be dismissing a hefty British achievement. My time as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change taught me that people don’t want politicians and activists to be po-faced defeatists. They want pragmatists who crack on with the job and are grown-up enough to accept a compromise. When I was MP for Hastings, my constituents broke down into three groups after the Brexit referendum. A small minority were hardcore Remainers who wouldn’t accept any form of Brexit. Another small minority were hardcore Leavers who wouldn’t accept any deal. The vast majority in the middle wanted a compromise deal, brokered without fuss, which kept us trading and friendly with Europe but honoured the referendum.That same silent majority exists when it comes to climate change. People want international leaders to come together and deal with it. They are prepared to make changes and compromises, because they know that the cost of failing to act is steep. What they are not interested in is perfectionism or cynical delay tactics.Amber Rudd was secretary of state for energy and climate change 2015-2016More from NewsBBC and other media asked to avoid using ‘dehumanising’ words like ‘migrant’Emmanuel Macron clashes with Boris Johnson and warns him not to \u0026#39exploit a tragic situation for political ends\u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s busiest railway stations revealed as Waterloo loses top spot during pandemicPrince William tells emergency workers: \u0026#39Be the first responders for your own mental health\u0026#39Winter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon stuck rut","story":"Instead she has, quite neatly, encapsulated the current status of the pro-independence movement that she leads. A YouGov poll has suggested that opposition to independence among Scots is now more popular than independence by a six-point margin. Perhaps more interestingly, the First Minister’s personal popularity has plummeted by nearly 40 per cent since the height of the pandemic in August last year. Before her political opponents start measuring the curtains in Bute House (from a safe distance), they should consider that Sturgeon remains, far and away, the most popular (or the least unpopular) political leader in Scotland.Recent SNP history has been a story of dramatic victories followed by fallow periods of introspection. A narrow win at the Holyrood elections in 2007 was followed four years later by a nationalist landslide and a consequent independence referendum, during which Alex Salmond took support for independence from an anaemic 30 per cent to 45 per cent. Under Sturgeon, a few months later, the SNP took all but three of Scotland’s 56 Westminster seats at the 2015 general election, ending Scottish Labour’s dominance of Scottish politics. There have been two more general elections and two more Holyrood elections since, each one delivering eye-watering triumphs for nationalism, and each has been accompanied by rampant speculation as to when (not if) the rerun referendum will be held. That unbroken run of success and the excitement it generated for her activists has been crucial to Sturgeon’s continued domination of her movement and of Scottish politics. It is the periods between such triumphs when SNP members start to get impatient: they have spent their entire lives dreaming of freedom from Westminster. Their leader’s urging towards patience is making her troops feel. . .  well, impatient.Which leaves Sturgeon in an uncomfortable position of promising a new referendum by the end of 2023 even though she and her ministers know she has no power to deliver it. She is instead betting on persuading the UK government to come to her aid by accepting what she describes as her “unarguable” case for a rerun vote.She is an intelligent woman and therefore must know that that isn’t going to happen. That being the case, and with a majority of Scots unconvinced about constant SNP assertions about mandates for another isive referendum, the First Minister is taking a big risk with talk of an unofficial (illegal) referendum that, by definition, could be nothing more than an expensive publicity stunt with no legal standing. Are Scots really in the mood to restage the disastrous Catalan referendum? Given YouGov’s findings on mandates for a second referendum, not to mention Sturgeon’s popularity and support for independence itself, it is clear that if, as she insists, she’s going nowhere in the near future, her movement is accompanying her every step of the way.More from NewsBBC and other media asked to avoid using ‘dehumanising’ words like ‘migrant’Emmanuel Macron clashes with Boris Johnson and warns him not to \u0026#39exploit a tragic situation for political ends\u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s busiest railway stations revealed as Waterloo loses top spot during pandemicPrince William tells emergency workers: \u0026#39Be the first responders for your own mental health\u0026#39Winter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"super jelly can survive run car could replace cartilage knees","story":"A “super jelly” created by scientists which can withstand enormous compressive forces, despite being soft and flexible, could one day replace cartilage in people with knee problems.The unique material, developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge, resembles a slab of gelatin but remains unchanged when driven over by a car.It could one day revolutionise robotics and also be used as a cartilage mimic, as it has similar properties to the natural material that protects our joints.When a person’s cartilage deteriorates following injury, disease or age, there is no substitute. Scientists are experimenting with synthetic options but have yet to find a solution.The researchers wrote in their paper, published in Nature Materials, that the “super jelly” is capable of supporting 100 megapascals without fracture - equivalent to 14,500 pounds per square inch. That means a stamp-sized piece could support an elephant.Researchers have been trying to make novel hydrogels for several years as they are flexible, durable and often self-healing. But until now, they have been unable to develop a durable version that can resist crushing.The new material uses a tubular molecule called cucurbituril, which can then host two other linked molecules. These molecules can be tweaked and modified by the researchers to alter how the entire gel behaves and performs.“At 80 per cent water content, you’d think it would burst apart like a water balloon, but it doesn’t. It stays intact and withstands huge compressive forces,” said Professor Oren Scherman, who spearheaded the project. “The properties of the hydrogel are seemingly at odds with each other.Dr Jane McCune, co-author from the Department of Chemistry and the University of Cambridge, added: “The way the hydrogel can withstand compression was surprising. It wasn’t like anything we’ve seen in hydrogels.Hydrogels are seen as integral to the future of soft robotics, a rapidly growing field where machines can handle and manipulate delicate objects without breaking them, for example, in farming and medicine.

I thought applying to the Home Office would be less political, less contentious, more organised and more impactful. But little did I know. I joined the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and after signing the Official Secrets Act, I settled into the MP and Ministerial Correspondence ision. This was a dynamic unit which gave me a good ground for future work and challenges ahead. This ranged from visa to passports, from asylum to human rights, from international students to the UK labour market. What I learned is that asylum seekers fleeing certain countries are never ed, due mainly to British economic interest in that country, the type of political regime, or because ing an asylum seeker would cause embarrassment to the sovereign of that country, no matter questionable their human rights practices. Some asylum seekers are officially designated stateless. People flee their home countries for a number of reasons, and when I interviewed asylum seekers as part of their application, many, believe it or not, would rather stay in their home countriesthe basic necessities of le - food, shelter and clothing - could be met for them and their children. Asylum seekers often talk about mining in their villages and the pollution it brings to the water, the babies born with deformities and the appalling working conditions their partners have to endure. Their government may have no financial muscle to challenge the foreign-owned companies and there are no labour laws. The over-mining helps contributes to the climate crisis, and when minerals and resources dry up, Western companies just pack their bags and leave. We know of one famous prime minster whose son was implicated in a coup in an African country – he simply picked up his bags and boarded a plane. Then there is terrorism. Asylum seekers were often extremely nervous, traumatised and bordering on the psychotic during my interviews with them , recalling the horrors of their journeys and their homes and community being burnt to the ground by insurgents. Sometimes even their child’s school, despite them not being involved in any religious or political movement. Asylum seekers can also be political prisoners or prisoners of conscience – simply for expressing a view. You can be tortured, raped, murdered, evenyour family member has a political view and not you. According to the International Organisation for Migrationsince , over , asylum seekers and migrants have died or disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea alone.  Why do they come  Asylum seekers often say the UK has a long tradition of welcoming people fleeing dangerous or totalitarian states. They say they believe their rights will be respected – whether they have £, or £ in the bank. That there is a court system, judiciary, and a trial – rather than an execution. They admire our fight for equality, fairness and social justice. Above all, asylum seekers say they believe they will have dignity.  There is a distinction between asylum seekers and refugees. An asylum seeker is just that – anyone fleeing persecution or death and seeking safety in another country. A refugee is someone who has actually been granted refugee status – meaning their claim has been fully assessed, usually via medical reports and reports in their country of origin and found to be genuine. Refugees are then granted asylum or humanitarian protection. At times this can be for a limited time to see whether the situation in their home country improves. So there is no automatic “open door” of asylum seekers as is the common perception. If a claim fails, asylum seekers are ed to Third Countries where we have an agreement - a safe country they have passed through on their way to the UK. We had a department in the Home Office dedicated to this known as the Third Country Unit. Most European countries are part of this agreement and signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, since we have left the EU, we cannotany asylum seeker to a Third Country. Own goal. Our government has signalled that it will also pull out of the ECHR. The UK again will not get the cooperation it seeks, and asylum seekers will not get the protection they deserve. Another own goal. An important strategy in the asylum crisis was that asylum seekers were able to apply for asylum at any British Embassy or High Commission in their home country with whatever documentation they had or none. Their claim would be assessed by embassy staff and intelligence officials and a decision would be made in a matter of months – not years as it is now today. No one wins in these scenarios. Not the taxpayer and certainly not the asylum seeker. This was a safe, sensible route and would often negate the contentious issue of an asylum seeker’s age. In its wisdom, the government decided to discontinue that system. Yet another own goal. The government has imposed hefty fines on lorries crossing the Channelan asylum seeker is found, and also the airline industry. Checks are now overzealous in these sectors. The only route left for asylum seekers are small unsafe boats - sometimes inflatable dinghies with little protection from the wind and waves. If a solution isn’t found fast, I fear many more will perish in the English Channel.

Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessubcommittee advising on behavioural science, said itaposs much more important for the Government to provide clear information on how well ventilated spaces are, rather than placing the responsibility on themselves to follow particular rules. And he stressed the importance of ventilation in reducing the spread of Coronavirus. Earlier this week, the Government updated its Covid guidance on testing and prevention, warning people that they are more likely to catch Covid or pass it onthey are in crowded spaces or where there is limited fresh air. Officials noted the risk of catching Covid is much higheryou are spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces and even told people to take lateral flow tests before heading out to crowded spaces. Nicola Sturgeon went a step further and told Scots to take rapid Covid tests anytime they were socialising or shopping.  Professor Reicher said improving the ventilation of all public spaces is the most crucial thing we can do to stop the spread of the airborne virus. Even more important than hand washing, he explained to a  of experts hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine. Rather than castigate the public as irresponsible, it will be much more productive for the Government to create systems that allow people to express the safety of spaces.The Department for Health and Social Care have only rolled out an advert explaining the importance of keeping spaces well ventilated, almost two years since the pandemic begun. The explainer film launched in November , shows the impact of ventilation on reducing COVID- levels, and has clear advice for people to open windows for  minutes each hour when socialising indoors. Health officials admitted new research reveals how only a third of the public understand importance of ventilation, backing up Professor Reicheraposs call for clearer Government messaging.The sage adviseraposs comments echo the calls of Independent Sage scientists. The group said there is a need for a public health messaging scheme, including a rating and potential certication system, that can support behaviour around the use of indoor spaces. It follows a new study from Cambridge University which claims Covid became much more lethal across the UK in late . Experts used modelling to show that infections were becoming more deadly even before the highly transmissible Alpha iant of the virus took hold. They concluded that other factors, such as pressure on health services and the colder months, may have led to a higher number of people dying once they were infected than earlier in the year. Ventilation has finally been addressed under Boris Johnsonaposs Covid aposplan Bapos for winter.

A Whitehall source previously told the Mirror that the aim was to deter people from making the crossing, as passengers were already dying trying to reach the UK. But Amnesty described attempts to intercept vessels as incredibly high-risk, adding that to push people back will endanger their lives which is totally at odds with the legal duty of rescue at sea. Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “It is disgraceful that the government is even considering pushing boats back in the Channel after yesterday’s tragic news. Priti Patel must immediately rule out these dangerous and cruel pushback tactics which don’t work and could cause yet more unnecessary deaths. The government’s incompetence and failure to get to grips with this crisis has led us to the heartbreaking situation we find ourselves in. Instead of yet more unworkable gimmicks, ministers must now focus on providing safe and legal routes to take refugees out of the grip of smugglers and traffickers.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: There are a number of operational capabilities that Border Force have. As Iaposve said on a number of occasions, I wouldnapost get into those operational tactics. Ms Patel is due to speak to her French counterpart Gerard Darmanin this morning before updating MPs on efforts to stop people smugglers sending desperate migrants across the Dover Strait. Mr Foster said The Home Secretary will be speaking to her French counterpart later this morning. Obviously our heart goes out in terms of those who have lost their lives yesterday and their loved ones. As you know, at least  people have died but it is a dynamic situation, the French authorities are investigating and obviously weaposre keen to let them get on with their work and weaposve obviously offered any support we can give. Tensions between France and Britain have been escalating, with a growing blame game over the crisis unfolding in the Channel. Boris Johnson has urged Emmanuel Macron to agree to joint police patrols along coast, but France has so far resisted the call. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “Yesterday we saw footage of French police standing by while people got the boat ready, picked up the engine and took to the water on the French side. They did absolutely nothing. Thataposs unacceptable and thataposs got to change.  The British are standing by willing to put people to help, the EU Iaposm sure will come to the Frenchaposs aid as well, this is a humanitarian crisis on the shores of France, these people smugglers must not be allowed to continue to ply their trade and put peopleaposs lives at risk in these wintry seas. It is vital that actionaposs taken and the only way to do that is to stop people on the beaches of France from getting into the boats and turning them around quickly in French waters. But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont said: Iaposm not sure that having more police officers or more materials on the French shore will help to stop these crossings because we have  or  kilometres of shore to monitor  . It only takes five to  minutes to take a boat and put it at sea filled with migrants, so Iaposm not sure it is only a question of money and the number of men. Charities stepped up calls for the Government to devise safe and legal routes to come to the UK. This tragedy was completely predictable, indeed it was predicted and it was completely preventable,” said Zoe Gardner, from the Joint Council of Welfare for Immigrants. This has to be a time for our Government to mark a turning point, this tragedy must not be allowed to continue and that means changing our approach, not more of the same failed policies. We need to offer people alternatives to the smuggling boats.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Priti Patel\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mims Davies called for tougher action to prevent the incidents after becoming a target of the vile, dangerous tactic.

Ms Davies said: “I cannot imagine the worry you would haveyou’d had one of those spikes on you. “It’s absolutely right that people report that and I’m very pleased Sussex Police are taking this very seriously.” She went on: “Please keep an eye on your drinks, please stay togetheryou’re out with friends, please make sure you’re being sensible when you’re out and about. “Andyou’re one of these culprits, absolute shame on you.

Parliamentaposs lobbying watchdog ruled a bid by Lord Hammond to arrange a meeting between OakNorth Bank and a senior Treasury official in July  was not acceptable and not consistent with the Business Appointment Rules. Advisory Committee on Business Appointmentschair Lord Pickles said it had been an unwise step for him to contact a senior Treasury official about a project developed by OakNorth. But Tory Cabinet Office Minister Lord True decided it wasnapost a deliberate attempt to break the rules, and so Lord Hammond would face no sanction. In that light, although we concur with your conclusion, we do not believe further sanctions should be taken given the particular circumstances of this case, Lord True said in a letter to the chair. We also note there has already been public criticism from your committee.  Lord Hammond had argued he emailed Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary at the Treasury, in a bid to establish that senior officials in the department were aware the bank was offering free support to aid the Covid pandemic national response. Lord Hammond joined British banking startup OakNorth as an advisor in January , just six months after leaving his role as Chancellor. Documents show the bank wanted to meet with the government to discuss a financial toolkit which might help the government’s response to the Covid- pandemic. But after OakNorth initially failed to get a response from Treasury, Lord Hammond contacted top official Charles Roxburgh to seek confirmation that OakNorthaposs message and offer of pro-bono support had been received and understood. Lord Hammond told Mr Roxburgh that OakNorth was “very keen to ensure that the right people” saw a presentation about “Covid stress-testing.” When he took the job at OakNorth, the committee told Lord Hammond he was banned from making contact with HMTit had been to benefit OakNorth or secure business on behalf of OakNorth.

The data appears to undermine top Tories’ insistence that asylum seekers should only use “safe and legal” routes to get to the UK, not dangerous small boats from France. After  people died trying to cross the Channel yesterday, Immigration Minister Kevin Foster highlighted the schemes as a way of helping people legitimately. He said: “What we want to do is focus our efforts on the most vulnerable in the regions concerned, rather than those who would prefer to claim asylum in the UK rather than the country they’ve reached.” Resettlement schemes were paused between March and December  due to the Covid pandemic, only for another UK lockdown to hit just after they resumed.  Home Office statistics published today now show that since December , , people have been assigned places with UK councils. Of those,  were relocated through the new UK Resettlement Scheme , which launched in March this year after being delayed by Covid. In total  were helped in January-March,  in April-June, and  in July-September.

Brave UK troops helped , British citizens and Afghans escape under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy . Separately, Tory ministers promised an Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme, which in its first year would help around , Afghans who could not escape in time. But a minister this week said they were still working urgently to design the ACRS. Before Covid hit, the resettlement policies were helping around , people per year. Figures show , were resettled in , , in  and , in .  Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: “The Home Secretary has spoken of her commitment to safe and legal routes but, once again, this shows her actions do not match her words.“Today’s statistics show the Government has - woefully – fallen short with only just over , having been resettled this year. At the same time, the Government closed down the Dubs Scheme having helped only  children when it was meant to help ,, and has still not set out how the Afghanistan Resettlement Scheme will work.“Having properly-managed safe and legal routes is essential to tackling the vile people-smuggling gangs – urgent action is needed.” It came as official figures revealed overall net migration to the UK has also dramatically dropped.

Police say she was also blue ripped jeans and white trainers when she vanished. They discovered her headphones and a pouch of tobacco on grass nearby. Brotheraposs Facebook posts Her brother Lee McLeodaposs desperate Facebook appeal illustrated the familyaposs torment.Police have rung and someone has handed in Bobbiaposs mobile, he posted. I’m begging everyone single person in Plymouth help me search everywhere search everything. Someone has my f***ing sister. In an earlier post he said: My sisteraposs phone has been tracked by police, however due to the phone being off, they’ve managed to know she’s still in the Plymouth area but don’t know her actual location. Body found  On Tuesday night came the shattering news that a body had been found as officers searched for the -year-old. A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said the body of a woman was located near Bovisand, South Hams, during their searches.

Two arrested  As the same time they announced a body had been found, police confirmed two men were arrested on suspicion of murder. Devon and Cornwall Police then later issued an update confirming one of the suspects has now been released. A spokesperson said: A -year-old man remains in police custody at this time on suspicion of murder under a warrant of further detention. A -year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released from police custody with no further action being taken in relation to this matter. aposSnatched by strangersapos theory  Detectives are understood to be working on a theory the young woman was abducted by strangers.

Earlier this year it was claimed that half of the worldaposs population will suffer from poor eyesight inside  years.Currently, patients undergo a two-hour session to mould their eye socket. But the procedure will cut the time it takes to be fitted with their prosthetics in half, experts say. “I’ve needed a prosthetic since I was , and I’ve always felt self-conscious about it,” he said. “When I leave my home I often take a second glance in the mirror, and I’ve not liked what I’ve seen. “This new eye looks fantastic and, being based on D digital printing technology, it’s only going to be better and better.”Professor Mandeep Sagoo told the BBC that this is a big step forward.The consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital, said the staff were “excited” ahead of the operation on Thursday.

Ten months after the tragic blaze which claimed the le of the previous owner, potential buyers are being given the opportunity to take on the ultimate fixer upper that would need a complete rebuild.Repair work alone could cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, buyers have been warned - so itaposs better to knock it down entirely and rebuild. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  The property is by far the cheapest on the market in Oxford but comes with no roof, is currently boarded up and is need of a lot of work. The listing, on Mchugh and Co, warns potential buyers that they view the house at their own risk due to the condition of the building. The terraced house with two floors is located near to the junction with Berry Close, close to local shops and public transport.  On the first floor there is three bedrooms and a bathroom and on the ground floor there is a reception room and a kitchen. The house also has a front and back garden. Devastatingly, the homeowner - -year-old Martin Patten - was killed in the fire alongside his dog Jolly in February. At the time, family friend Lynne Berry, set out on a mission to raise £, to help rebuild the home which is barely a shell.  But the fundraiser was cancelled after she received online abuse. The house will be auctioned on Thursday, December . Just last month, a grim studio flat in central London that was left in a similar condition went on the market for £,.  And for that enormous sum its owner would get a pad the size of an average single-car garage. Even the estate agentaposs description fairly represents the gaff, calling it run down and in disrepair. But the property definitely had potential. A glimmer of hope lies in the fact that other similar studios in the block reach a tidy sum of £,. Agent photos from neighbouring properties show gleaming white walls, light-filled living rooms and even compact but stylish kitchens.The tired flat is being marketed on Rightmove by central London agents Frank Harris  Co, but even they admit it is in dire need of some renovation. Pictures show what appears to be smoke damage with every room appearing blackened and charred. In June, a team of estate agents went viral for their honest advert for a fire-torched house with an almost identical price tag to the one in Cowley. The three-bed terrace home was used by previous owners as a cannabis factory, with the hypothesis being that the hydroponic lights sparked a blaze. Several rooms are severely smoke damaged while the bathtub appears to have melted.

This group survived the journey, but hours later a child and five women were among those who died when their boat capsized in the ­Channel’s worst-ever migrant boat disaster.PM Boris Johnson tonight said that he was “deeply saddened” by the tragedy. Migrants drag a huge inflatable across the beach to the sea, with French police watching from a pick-up as children are put on the boat for the perilous Channel crossing. The two officers did nothing to stop the dinghy setting off near the town of Wimereux just after am.  Mercully, six-and-a-half hours later it arrived on the coast near Dover, where Border Force officials were there to help. The group survived the journey on the day at least  other desperate migrants, including five women and a young girl, died attempting the same crossing. The death toll was earlier estimated to be as high as , but the French government said late on Wednesday night that its official toll was , down from . French interior minister Gerald Darmanin described the victims’ vessel as “very frail, like a pool you blow up in your garden”. Read MoreRead More French President Emmanuel Macron called for an emergency meeting of European ministers, as he vowed: “France will not let the Channel become a cemetery.” The scale of the tragedy unfolded in the afternoon when fishermen out at sea  miles north of Calais spotted bodies floating in the waves. By evening, French Coast Guard and Navy vessels had retrieved nearly  bodies and at least two survivors, with boats and helicopters searching for more.  Six people had been seen alive in the water. The British Coast Guard was helping the operation and, with more than  dinghies setting out today, officials fear other vessels could have sunk too. Four suspected traffickers were arrested and Dunkirk prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for manslaughter and “assistance with illegal immigration”. Gangs have been charging refugees more than £, for passage in inflatable dinghies, with le jackets of little use in the treacherous currents and freezing temperatures of the Channel.  The joint rescue operation was called off late tonight. Mr Darmanin said: “There are no words strong enough to describe the criminality of the smugglers.” Before todayaposs tragedy,  people had died attempting the crossing this year. More than , migrants have made the journey in November alone, the most ever in a single month. It brings the total for the year so far to more than ,, compared to , in , and , in . Britain pledged to give France £million to stop the crossings but tonight Boris Johnson, who chaired a Cobra meeting on the crisis, offered more support.He said: “The operation being conducted by our friends on the beaches, supported with £million from the UK to help patrol the beaches, the technical support we’ve been giving, they haven’t been enough. “Our offer is to increase our support and to work with our partners on the beaches concerned, on the launching grounds for these boats.”He said smugglers had to be shown “they can’t simply get people over the Channel”, or they would continue to “get away with murder”. France has refused to let UK officers work on the other side of the Channel to detect people-smuggling operations.The two French officers at the beach near Wimereux were powerless to stop the boat launching with around  families on board. The police truck flashed its lights and circled the migrants but soon gave up and went to patrol another area of beach. Home Secretary Priti Patel posted: “This Government’s New Plan for Immigration will overhaul our broken asylum system and address many of the long-standing pull factors encouraging migrants to make the perilous journey.”  But the Government is under pressure to offer safe asylum routes.Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: “The UK Government, France and the wider international community have a duty to prevent people being forced into such peril.” Enver Solomon, of the Refugee Council, called for “safe routes for those men, women and children in desperate need of protection”.British Red Cross chief executive Mike Adamson said: “Everyone deserves to live in safety and it should be unacceptable to us that people have no choice but to make dangerous crossings in their search for this.” aposVictims of inevitable tragedyapos - Comment - by Jason Beattie, Mirror head of politics The deaths in the Channel were a tragedy waiting to happen.We knew that desperate people were risking their lives on a daily basis to seek a better le. And we knew they were being exploited by people smugglers.And we knew that unless something was done, it would result in the loss of lives.Politicians on both sides of the Channel pledged action but what was promised was not delivered.  In September  Home Secretary Priti Patel agreed a joint plan with France for   patrols on the beaches of northern France, greater intelligence sharing and “intense efforts” to tackle gangs. These measures, we were told, would prevent the majority of crossings by the spring of . But so far this year more than , people have crossed and we are struggling to control our borders. It is not for lack of money. The UK Government paid the French £.million in , followed by a further £million in July this year.  With some justication Britain claims France is not keeping its side of the bargain. But much of the blame lies at the door of the Government. It has all but shut the door for genuine asylum seekers. With no safe passage, those escaping bloodshed and oppression turned in desperation to criminal gangs. And now we are out of the EU we are no longer part of the Dublin agreement that states illegal migrants must be processed in the EU country they first entered. Solving this crisis requires compassion and co-operation. Both have been in short supply.

The thousands of pounds referenced were supposedly paid out between May and August last year, Leeds Live reported. The couple insisted they have never claimed them before, and believe they have been the victims of fraudsters who have used their personal details. But the couple claim when they tried to explain this to the DWP, they were told by the debt management team the debt of £,. must be paid by December  - or it could be taken from them via payroll or bailfs could be sent to their home.  Mrs Robinson said: The letter from DWP came out of the blue, at first we thought it was a scam, it was only after we looked into it we realised it was legit. She claims when they called the DWP they were told their personal information was used for the benefit claims, so they were responsible for the debt - and couldnapost see the account into which the benefits were paid. She claims the DWP told her the claims for Universal Credit stopped when a request for ID was made. Mr and Mrs Robinson have never claimed Universal Credit in their lives and the letter was the first of its kind they had ever recieved at the home they have lived at for more than  years. She said: What an absolute joke. My husband has been so frustrated and anxious over the situation, weaposve hardly slept, we feel abandoned. Itaposs taken such a toll on daily le, itaposs all we can think about since receiving the letter, you work all your le then someone takes money off you. It would be a weight lted off our shoulderswe could just speak to someone in the fraud department.She said the couple phoned the fraud department only to hear an automated response saying the phones were currently unmanned due to coronavirus and to visit the government website.They were also unable to find an email address and resorted to sending a letter. Mrs Richardson said: This is absolutely ridiculous, there has been not one person from the DWP trying to help us, with another obstacle at every turn.

My husband has spoken with Citizen’s Advice who are trying to help, we even called the police but were told they can’t help with this matter. We are going to contact our local MP to seethey can help, it’s absolutely disgusting the treatment we have received from the DWP.

Dad-of-four and parenting blogger Simon Harris made the generous offer after parents at Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle in Gwynedd, north Wales, received a letter warning them that their children wouldnapost be fed unless their accounts were up to date. The letter, sent out in the name of headteacher Neil Foden, said the school cook had been instructed not to give food to any child unless their inidual accounts were in credit by November . A “handful of pupils had run up debts totalling more than £, resulting in an unexpected deficit in the school meals budget, Foden said.Writing on Twitter, Mr Harris called the letter madness and offered to pay the £, that was outstanding on the pupilsapos accounts.However,Man Behaving Dadlyblogger Mr Harris said his offer was not taken up by the school - who have since released a statement saying they are not supportive of any system which refuses the provision of a school dinner. In a post on Facebook, Mr Harris said: After offering to pay the pupil lunch debt at Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle, I had no reply to the tweets or emails, and it was made clear to me by others linked to the school council that any attempt to transfer the money to them would be refunded.Keen for the money to go to a good cause, the dad-of-four has decided to donate the money to a local foodbank instead.  He continued: Therefore, I’m pleased to say that the £, has now been donated to Arfon Food Bank   Banc Bwyd Arfon who are the closest Trussell Trust-linked food bank to the village. Some of their food packages go to families within the school’s catchment area, and so it’s still going to benefit families with pupils at the school.The Essex-based blogger toldNorth Wales Live: Iaposve tried to be as good as my word in the circumstances. Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlleaposs letter attracted lots of media attention after it was posted on social media last week. Premier League footballer and free school meals advocate Marcus Rashford responded to the letter and called for the school to be more understanding of pupilsapos circumstances.It has now been announced that primary school pupils in Wales will be given free school meals as part of a new deal between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru.

And one royal she appears to share an especially strong relationship with is the Queen. Although Prince Williamaposs romance with Kate blossomed during their university days - it wasnapost until years after that Kate finally officially met the Monarch.It was thought that at first the Queen had some concerns about Kate as a future we for her grandson. But these concerns have clearly faded away with the pair now enjoying a close bond. Here we look at how their relationship bloomed... First meeting  William and Kate first started dating while both attending St Andrews University in Scotland between  and . They both graduated in the same ceremony attended by the Queen, but despite being an item, it seems an official meeting between Kate and Her Majesty came much later.In fact, it was in  at the wedding of Williamaposs cousin Peter Phillips to his now ex-we Autumn.Recalling the meeting during an interview to mark their engagement, Kate said: Well I first met her at Peter and Autumnaposs wedding and again it was in amongst a lot of other guests and she was very friendly.

But despite the friendly meeting, the Queen reportedly did have her reservations about Kate as a future we for William.Royal expert Katie Nicholl claims Her Majesty always liked Kate but was worried she didnapost have an identity of her own before she married into the Royal Family.In her book, The Making of a Royal Romance, Katie writes: Privately she had grave concerns and believed that Kate needed to have a job and an identity in her own right before an engagement was announced. And sheaposs not the only one, with royal correspondent Phil Dampier echoing the claims and saying the Queen was worried about Kateaposs work ethic. Phil told express: Kate was Williamaposs girlfriend for eight or nine years before they got engaged and got married. There was a phase where she appeared to be doing very little really.The Queen once remarked Kate doesnapost do very much so I think she had a fairly long entrance to the Royal family.Rare privilege  However, it seems the Queenaposs doubts were short-lived and before marrying William she was invited to spend some time at the Queenaposs Scottish retreat Balmoral.Keen for Kate to feel welcome, the Monarch then gave Kate a rare privilege. According to author and royal commentator Katie, the Queen allowed Kate to take photos while at Balmoral, knowing how much she loved photography. It may not sound like a big deal to the average person, but as Katie explains this simply wasnapost the done thing usually. In her book, Kate: The Future Queen, she wrote: Until now the Queen had met Kate only fleetingly at the wedding of Peter and Autumn Phillips, but she went out of her way to make her feel welcome, giving her permission to take pictures at Balmoral. And according to Katie, this and being invited to Balmoral showed how the Queen was ready to let Kate into the inner royal circle. She added: As a woman who has lived her entire le in the public eye, the Queen rarely lets her guard down, and very few apart from her family and closest friends get to see the real Elizabeth. Borrowing jewellery  Kate and William finally wed at Westminster Abbey in April , with the proud Queen watching on as her grandson tied the knot. And in a sign of her approval, Her Majesty allowed Kate to wear her beautul Cartier Halo tiara on her big day. But itaposs not just the tiara that Kate has borrowed from the Queenaposs personal collection over the years. Sheaposs also worn her Cambridge Loveraposs Knot tiara, her Lotus Flower tiara, a pair of sapphire earrings and one of her pearl chokers. Touching gts  But itaposs not just the Queen who has gted Kate several pieces of jewellery.Kate has also given Her Majesty sweet gts - including a touching homemade present on her birthday. The Duchess revealed how she had been in a pickle over what to get the Queen for her birthday.  And in a documentary to mark the Monarchaposs th birthday, she revealed: “I was thinking, ‘Gosh, what should I give her ’ “I thought, ‘I’ll make her something.’ Which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my granny’s recipe of chutney. I was worried about it, but I noticed next day it was on the table. “Such a simple gesture went such a long way for me.” Shared interests and future role So what is it that makes the two women get along so well  According to royal author Victoria Murphy, itaposs their very similar personalities.  She told Yahoo UK : I’ve always thought that Kate has more in common personality-wise with the Queen not an extrovert, but quietly self-assured with a love of the outdoors and the ability to compartmentalise.I think she still remains more of a team player than a leader though and perhaps more of a listener than a talker, but I think these qualities are well-suited to her current and future roles.

The defendant was with his father in the garage of his home in the leafy village of Yatton, in Somerset when his dad refused to give him money.Richardson picked up the weapon and struck him over the head while his back was turned before hitting him again after he fell to the floor. After beating his dad, he turned on mum Janet, and struck her over the head with the crowbar three times.He hit his mum with such force that the iron bar became embedded in her skull.Neighbours heard screams and ran to the property, where they discovered the seriously injured couple and Richardson walking away from the scene.Richardson, of no fixed abode, has been jailed for  years at Bristol Crown Court after confessing to two counts of attempted murder last week. After the cruel beating, Richardson called a woman he had befriended while staying at a hostel, said Prosecutor Rachel Drake.Latasha Sheppard recalled he sounded out of breath and she thought he was running, as he told her down the phone: “I’ve just done a double murder.His mother has suffered reduced cognitivesince the incident.The attack caused underlying compressed skull fractures with signicant le-threatening hematomas [bruising].The bruises were putting pressure on her brain and surgery was required to reverse this.She now needs two-on-one support and itaposs still unclear whether she will ever recover.Richardsonaposs father also needed surgery after his skull and elbow were fractured.The day before the attack, the -year-old threatened to chop his parentsapos heads off during a conversation with a friend.He told her he wanted to make a name for himself before he mentioned killing a wealthy Australian couple, and the devil.In a police interview following the attacks, he said: I am a psychopath. I live in hell the devil wanted my parents dead. But the prosecution argued that he knew what he was doing at the time of the attack, knew it was wrong, and therefore couldnapost plead insanity.He had, however, spent long periods of time on psychiatric wards after being diagnosed with schizophrenia. One inpatient stay lasted six years between  and .Community mental health discharged him from their care six months before the incident, after he told a nurse he did not believe he had psychosis and wanted to stop his medication. Psychiatrist Dr John Sandford told the court Richardson was not displaying symptoms of schizophrenia at the time of the offences. Adding that the disorder was not the cause of his actions on  April. Defending, Harry Ahuja asked that his client is sent to prison where he “felt more comfortable” rather than be detained in a psychiatric hospital. “He felt more settled in prison”, he said. “He was keen for the court to sentence him to an immediate custodial sentence.” Judge Lambert described the defendant’s actions as chillingly premeditated as he handed down a -year custodial sentence with an extended licence term of five years. He made an indefinite hospital order alongside the custodial sentence, meaning Richardson will serve the first part of his sentence in a secure hospital facility before being transferred to prison when appropriate. “You have had near-constant conflict with your parents since you were a teenager”, he said. He added: “Drug abuse is the route cause of your problems. “You have made the lives of your parents a living nightmare and you have previously made attempts on their lives. “You acknowledge attempts to kill your parents on four occasions.” Judge Lambert said the messages he sent to his friends show his actions were premeditated. He added: “There is little evidence there were active symptoms of schizophrenia at the time of the offences. “They were chillingly premeditated, you admitted premedication in your statements at the time. These are premeditated hideous offences. “You are dangerous, very dangerous, and you will be for a long time, there is a high risk to members of the public.” Speaking after the case, DC Lucy Hastings-Knott said: “James Richardson’s violent actions that day have caused devastation for his parents and siblings, whose lives have been turned upside down. “There is no doubt he tried to commit murder and it’s only down to excellent medical care and a degree of luck that fortunately neither of them died.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON PrisonsCourt caseCrown courtMental healthCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Bizarre footage of the incident shows the hungry customer parked up in the centre of the road in Manchester city centre last Friday, blocking a large truck and the cars behind from passing. Multiple people can be seen attempting to help or intervene, only for the stubborn man to repeatedly shout “I just want the fish and chips that Iaposve paid for”. Passerby David Williams had presumed the battery on the manaposs scooter was flat so went over to seehe could help but was told to “back off” by the scooter user. In the clip, the furious customer bellows at anyone who urges him to move, despite holding up traffic for several minutes while waiting for his fish and chips order to be brought out to him.  He then becomes embroiled in an explicit slanging match with furious drivers, branding them “f***ing low lives” and threatening them with “the law”. Even when his meal finally emerges, he refuses to budge, even telling a frustrated policeman who stops on his motorbike that “as soon as he gets the chance heaposll be out of the way”. The copper then proceeds to escort him down the road while warning heaposs “causing chaos”. David, a local Manchester man, said the scooter driver “wasn’t moving anywhere”. You can hear the horns going, the guy in the lorry behind was shouting but I couldnapost hear what he was saying,” he said. Everyone was getting irate, not knowing what was going on.  I was on route from an interview to where I live and I just happened to see this guy in the distance sitting in the middle of the road in a wheelchair. I thought he must have broken down or his motor had gone. I came to his aid initially but he shouted at me so I backed off. There was traffic behind him so I thought there must have been some reason why he was stuck there in the middle of the road. I got closer and realised he was waiting for his fish and chips of all things, at . in the morning. He paid for his fish and chips and was waiting for them to come out. I just couldnapost believe it. I was gobsmacked heaposd stopped in the middle of the road with a [lorry] behind him which could quite easily have pushed him aside. There were more than  other cars behind him. As Test and Trace general assistant David, , stood at the roadside in disbelief, he claims the bloke was there for more than five minutes while ious onlookers approached him to warn of the commotion. Itaposs quite a narrow street, itaposs one-way, sothereaposs a blockage at the front youaposre pretty stuck,” he said. After more than three minutes filming the heated arguments, David then spotted a unormed officer pull up at the side of the road while someone asked “have we got a protest going on here ”. Upon realising the wheelchair user is sat in the middle of the narrow side street, he warmly says: “right, letaposs go, youaposre causing chaos young man” before putting his thumb up at the lorry driver in thanks. David said: A policeman on a motorbike spoke to him and the man said aposIaposm waiting for my changeapos. The chap came out from the chippy with his change then off he went down the road followed by the local constabulary. He was making sure he kept going. You donapost see that very often.

She was described as very frightened and nervous when she arrived in July but has started to come out of her shell. However, living in kennels has left her stressed and it is hoped she can find a permanent home before Christmas. In a post on Facebook, Oakwood said: “How has Epiphany been with us  days and still no viewings “Not only is Epiphany absolutely stunning but she has a larger than le personality and is a true bundle of fun! She who loves running around and playing with toys, she also enjoys a fuss once she knows you. She has lots of potential and is a beautul dog. Epiphany needs an owner with a lot of time and patience to help her build up her confidence with people and certain other dogs. The post continued: Epiphany is too nervous to be placed with younger children and needs a mature home. She can be selective about her doggy friends so would be best with a very calm male that will not pester her. She does enjoy the company of other dogs and could live with a male dog and children  years and over. Epiphany will need to live in a home with ft secure fencing and someone who can supervise her in the garden as she has been known to make escape attempts.If youaposre interested in rehoming Epiphany, or any other dogs in Oakwoodaposs care, visit their website.

Campaigners last night called for a rethink of rules which allow giants such as Pfizer to siphon off money from a publicly funded vaccine. The NHS paid £.bn to Pfizer for  million doses of its Covid vaccine, with a £.bn mark-up above production cost. The jab cost just £. to produce – but the taxpayer was billed £ a dose for the first  million jabs and £ a dose for the next  million.  The eye-watering profit margin is more than six times the £million ministers have allowed NHS England to spend on pay rises for nurses.Campaign group Global Justice Now has called on the Government to drive down drug prices by waiving intellectual property rules on coronavirus vaccines and treatments for the remainder of the pandemic.The rules allow Pfizer to patent the vaccine and hold the exclusive rights to produce them. This means they can dominate the markets, setting prices without any competition.What do you think of this story  Join the debate in our comments sectionPharma campaigner Tim Bierley said: “Like all of our Covid- vaccines, the Pfizer-BioNTech jab was developed with huge public funding. “It should belong to all of us, not used to rip off the NHS. “Throughout this pandemic, the Government’s priorities have been all wrong. Instead of valuing the key workers who have got us through it, or ensuring everyone has access to lesaving vaccines and treatments, they’ve helped big businesses profit from a crisis.  “At the World Trade Organisation next month, the Government has a choice to make. They can stand with our NHS and demand the right to healthcare for all, or they can side with Pfizer and other big-business profiteers who only want to extract a profit from the public purse.” The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received £.bn in public funding, mostly from the German and American governments. But the company has been allowed to demand huge profits from healthcare systems around the world. Pfizer says it will net bn this year from Covid vaccine sales. AstraZeneca partnered with Oxford University to sell Covid jabs at cost while the pandemic lasted. But this month it announced it was to start signing deals for profit. More than  countries, including the United States, support a waiver on intellectual property rights, which was first proposed by India and South Africa last October.

Thanksgiving in America also marks the start of the run-up to Christmas and speculation is already mountingHarry and Meghan willto the UK for the festive season.However, one report has claimed they will not be coming to the UK to join the Queen for her first Christmas without the late Prince Philip. The couple had reportedly been invited to join the rest of the royals at Sandringham for Christmas. It would be the first chance for Royal Family to meet Lilibet, the Queenaposs namesake great-granddaughter. Meghan and Archie have yet toto the UK since they left for the US last year. The Queen has faced a number of health concerns in recent weeks, after being hospitalised for a night in October and then having to cancel her appearance at the Remembrance Day service after spraining her back. But a source told Page Six : “There’s a lot that goes into the logistics and the planning of the family Christmas, so of course, staff know that Harry and Meghan are not coming.“If they were, they would have communicated it to their family by now. “But this is Her Majesty’s first Christmas without her husband, so one would have hoped they would want to be with her.” The Sussexes have not commented on the claims.

Charles’ romance with Camilla during his marriage to Diana has been part of royal gossip for decades and that his first love was never the Princess of Wales who was forced to suffer in silence for much of the time.It is a version that was also pushed by the Netflix series The Crown where he was seen heading off to meet up with Camilla and Diana was left crying at home.But this take on the marriage has been disputed by a former protection officer who said that Diana first had other love interests. Allan Peters has claimed that Charles began his romance with Camilla again after he found out that Diana was having an affair with another protection officer, the late Barry Mannakee.  Peters also said that he was the one to tell Charles of Diana’s relationship with Mannakee. The popular perception is that the Prince of Wales was straying all the way through his marriage — and that is definitely, unequivocally, not the case, Peters told CNN. The first person that strayed was the Princess. He went back to see Mrs Parker Bowles after he learned about her affair with Mannakee. Diana’s affair with Mannakee is believed to have started in  during a fishing trip to Balmoral. Then a year later he was moved to the Diplomatic Protection Squad where he died aged  in a crash. The version from Peters that Diana strayed first was also claimed by Jonathan Dimbleby in his authorised biography of Charles published in . Peters told CNN: I started to notice her behaviour was unusual whenever we were anywhere near Mannakee, so I decided to talk to her about it. For the first  minutes, she categorically denied it. But then she told me exactly what was going on: she was having some sort of relationship with Mannakee. He said that Charles asked him why Diana was acting dferently, and Peters told CNN that he replied that he had better speak to her about it. “Well, I’ve tried all that, and the only thing that seems to be upsetting her is that Barry Mannakee is going back to unorm. And,she’s that upset, Barry can stay, Peters claims Charles told him. At that stage, I was forced to say: aposWell, Sir,he stays, then I’m afraid I’ll have to leave.apos And, I think, at that point the penny dropped. He was utterly shocked and was clearly very upset.

In recent years, there has been a string of fictionalised TV shows and films about the Royal Family ranging from The Crown on Netflix to Princess Diana movie Spencer. It’s never been confirmedthe likes of the Queen or Kate Middleton have actually sat down in front of their TVs to watch these dramas. But according to Ken Wharfe, a former royal protection officer who worked for Princess Diana from  to , the royals do indeed love to watch these types of TV shows and movies.He told OK! : The royals love that stuff. They will watch it and they have no fear of that. They’re watching it to see how true it is or how untrue it is.However, some of these shows, especially The Crown have recently come under fire, with their historical accuracy called into question. And Ken added: Peter Morgan [creator of The Crown] has said himself that this isn’t a documentary of truthful facts. Some of it is truthful and some of it has a license to draw people in.

But one thing’s for certain, Diana didn’t roller skate around Buckingham Palace.” The Crown season five will be released on Netflix in  with filming for it currently underway.The new episodes will focus on the royals during the s - one of their most turbulent times in recent history.The early s saw the breakdown of the marriages of Prince Charles and Diana as well as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.There was also a devastating fire at Windsor Castle in , which the Queen dubbed her annus horribilis. Later in the decade, Diana gave her famous BBC Panorama interview, where she talked about Charlesaposs relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.And in , she tragically died aged  following a car crash, leaving the world completely heartbroken.Season five of the show will see wholesale changes to The Crown cast with the role of the Queen falling to BAFTA winner Imelda Staunton, who takes over from Olivia Colman.The Two Popes star Johnathan Pryce will portray Prince Philip and is taking over from Tobias Menzies. Meanwhile, the coveted role of Princess Diana has been given to Elizabeth Debicki, who takes the part from previous actress Emma Corrin. However, speaking to True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, royal historian Anne Whitelock said the new season of the show might not be something the royals want to watch when it is released. She said: If the Royal Family have found The Crown uncomfortable viewing up until now, this season is not going to give them any respite.  However, Prince Harry confessed earlier this year he has watched the show - and says it is more accurate than people think.During an interview with James Corden, he explained it is loosely based on the truth. He added: They donapost pretend to be news, itaposs fictional but itaposs loosely based on the truth. Of course itaposs not strictly accurate, but loosely, it gives you a rough idea about what that lestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything , what can come from that. I am way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my we or myself.

The Christmas tree is always the jewel in the crown of a homeaposs decorations and so deciding when to put it up is a big deal. Thankfully, following a study by electrics firm ERF, some answers have started to emerge about when exactly really is best.After the challenging months gone by, and with many families relishing the prospect of being able to spend Christmas together again after a year apart, the phrase that the holidays get earlier every year may never have been so welcome.

Jo had hoped to celebrate her centenary with the whole family in person but, despite her party being cancelled due to Covid concerns, she was left feeling very special on her big day.As well as receiving a Royal birthday card from Her Majesty she was inundated with gts, cards and video messages from family members as far afield as Canada, USA and Australia. Jo was married to husband Dave for  years before he passed away in  aged .Their children include eight daughters – Pauline, Joan, Judith, Barbara, Mary, Catherine, Susan and Steph, together with sons, Doug, Bernard, Gerard and Dave.Her oldest child is now aged , while her youngest great-grandchild is just five months old.Instead of birthday presents, Jo asked friends and family to make donations to Our Hospitals Charity towards the Stroke Unit at James Cook University Hospital, where late husband Dave was treated before his passing. The couple lived in the North East their entire lives, only moving away for a brief period during the war while Dave served as an wireless operator and air gunner at RAF Valley, Holyhead, and had a brief stint in Hereford at the end of the War. Despite a health scare two years ago, Jo is still going strong at her care home in Linthorpe on the outskirts of the town.Eldest child Pauline said: Mum has always been the most loving, interesting and energetic mother, always on the go, putting us children first and herself last.My earliest memory of her would have been  when I came in from a walk and found Mum in the kitchen with hands and arms covered in red.I was terried but it turned out she was dying someoneaposs old curtains for our new house.Eldest son Doug paid tribute to his mother and said: She not only had  children but then went back to full-time work until her retirement at .Her favourite joke is that she knew what she was doing in bearing so many children – ensuring that she had sufficient carers as she grows old.And she often complains that Covid is preventing her from going off on holiday, which is unfair as she might not have many years left!

Kate looked stunning in her glittering green recycled Jenny Packham gown while Prince William was dapper in a velvet blue tuxedo jacket and bow tie.And not only did they look dazzling, the pair seemed to be on top form - and in one sweet moment, Kate was caught on camera cracking a joke at her husbandaposs expense.After the performance, which included sets by Ed Sheeran and Sir Rod Stewart, the royal couple were introduced to some of the performers and others attending the show.  Footage shows Kate chatting to one man and William another but he starts to have a small coughing fit. Like a true professional, William carries on with his chat as aides go to fetch him a glass of water. As the aide s with the water, Kate turns to her husband, before laughing and joking his tickly throat was caused by too much singing.

Although the performance took place last week, it is due to air on TV next month. And it appears it wonapost be the only time we will see Kate and William on TV in the coming weeks.Reports yesterday suggested that the couple has banned the BBC from showing their Christmas carol concert amid anger over a new royal documentary. The charity fund-raiser, which is reportedly set to be hosted by Kate herself at Westminster Abbey, will be broadcast by rival ITV. It is said the Cambridges have opted to turn their back on the Beeb after its two-part series The Princes and the Press kicked off on Monday night.It has been claimed William - who missed the first part while attending the Tusk Awards - had briefed against his younger brother Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle. A source claimed to The Sun the move is a “real coup” for ITV, with the special having been arranged by the BBC before a U-turn following the “terrible row over the documentary”.“It is a brand new format — the royals have never hosted a televised TV concert before. And to have the Duchess leading on it is a big deal,” they said. “Naturally most royal programming goes automatically to the BBC as the national broadcaster. Now it looks like they will work more with ITV in the future.” The source added ITV were “very surprised but delighted” to the call offering them the show. Kensington Palace declined to comment when contacted by the Mirror about the carol concert. The Mirror also contacted the BBC for comment.

TikToker @emmanuttyjane told how she and her friend came up with the plan after seeing a special offer at the popular roast dinner chain.Toby offered standard adult plates for only a fiver, but the big sell was that children ate for free when families paid them a visit.

As such many may find themselves taking it out on the doctoraposs receptionist or assuming they are being rude when they are actually just really busy.A former doctoraposs receptionist has recently lted the lid on what itaposs really like to work in this role and shared some of the biggest mistakes patients can make. Speaking to Fabulous, Richard Kellow, who now works as a hypnotherapist at Kellow Hypnotherapy, told how the job is non-stop all day and the receptionist does so much more than just answering the phones.G et the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.He said: It was non-stop from the moment we switched on the phones in the morning. As well as booking appointments, weaposd type referral letters from doctors to specialists and do the filing. Weaposd also liaise with the couriers who collected the blood and urine samples taken, and then weaposd process prescriptions and have to keep the waiting room tidy. Theyaposd also have to deal with patients demanding to see the doctor quicker and assuming the receptionist was making them wait just for fun. Sometimes people felt that we just didn’t want them to see the doctor - asit was our choice when they would get medical attention or maybe we were just making them wait for the fun of it, Richard recalled. In reality, it would make our le so much easierwe could get everyone through as quickly and smoothly as possible. He went on to say how dealing with rude patients was the most dficult part of the job, as when people get stressed they often refuse to listen to logic or reason. As such people often committed some major faux pas towards the receptionists - including making personal comments about their image, booking appointments and then not turning up and making demands to see a doctor. These are the biggest mistakes a patient can make according to Richard, as well as assuming the receptionist is being rude, when really they are just doing their job. Remember that they are there to help and not hinder you, he added. Sometimes it’s easier for us to put our head down and get on with the job.

You might have fond memories of taking on one of the leading roles as Mary or Joseph, or you mightaposve preferred to stay in the background as a star, or even one of the wise men - but either way, it was the pinnacle of attending a Christian school. Many parents will look back on these memories fondly as they watch their own children taking part in the annual performance later this year. When youaposre a kid, being picked for a certain role in the nativity can feel huge, but does it actually mean anything, or is it just done randomly   Well, according to one former teacher, the role given to your child could say an awful lot more about them than you think. Leon Hady, former superhead and founder of Guide+, told The Sun: Each year at my previous school, Year Two was tasked with the job of putting on the much coveted Nativity play. It was a performance that had the hall filled with parents, teachers and students who would be won over by a very small and very adorable cast retelling the much loved story of Nativity to bring the Autumn term to a close Given the signicance of the play, much was deliberated when it came to picking the children who would take on each role. Leon has gone to the trouble of explaining why some children were chosen for particular roles in the play and exactly what it says about them.  Mary According to Leon, the leading lady position was given to the child who could give the most convincing weary expression, while sitting sensibly for a long amount of time. Although, as most of us will no doubt remember, the role was always, always given to one of the top achievers in the class - after all, it was an honour and privilege. Joseph When it came to Joseph, Leon explained that the role would usually be given to a child who could be relied upon, but who also would benefit from a confidence boost. He added that it could also be someone that had the potential, but didn’t have self-belief. Despite being main characters, Mary and Joseph donapost actually have that many lines, so it means that not much consideration needs to be given to their acting ability. The Inn Keeper As we all know, the Inn Keeper played a small but pivotal role in the Nativity, becauseit wasnapost for them, Away In A Manger would have some very dferent lyrics. According to Leon, this role would be reserved for the cheeky, funny, outspoken member of the class, who could passionately deliver the line, thereaposs no room at the inn! The Angels Although the angels donapost have anything to say in the Nativity, their costumes are arguably among the cutest in the whole play and often, Leon says, these kids would be given a dance routine to make up for the lack of lines. Therefore, these roles would be given to kids who could comprehend basic dance routines while commanding the attention of their audience. The Three Kings The three kings were some of the less vocal roles in the Nativity, but still an essential part of the cast, as they delivered the gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Therefore, Leon said, these roles would be given to kids who were slightly shier, but still wanted to be part of the main story. Narrators And, finally, one of the most underrated roles of all were the narrators, who were essential in telling the story. According to Leon, the narrators needed to be loud and confident, with the ability to learn their lines well.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, liked the unframed sketch of a mother and child, which was elegantly drawn onto yellow linen.He didnapost suspect it was an original piece of artwork of any signicance, even though it had one of the art world’s most well-known monograms— Albrecht Dürer aposs A.D., as the Smithsonian Magazine reports. Now the artwork has been assessed by experts and scholars, who agree the sketch is an original - and conservative estimates put the value at around £m . What do you think about the sketch  Let us know in the comments...The sketch was sold in Massachusetts in  by the family of late architect Jean-Paul Carlhian, and previously it had been passed down by the family. Clford Schorer, an art collector, said: It was an incredible moment when I saw the Dürer. It was either the greatest forgery I have ever seen - or a masterpiece. The artwork was veried by two telltale features, the artistaposs monogram was done with the same ink featured in the drawing, and it was done on paper bearing a watermark seen on more than  sheets used by the artist.  Albrecht Dürer is a German painter from the renaissance movement, who established his reputation and influence across Europe in his twenties due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in contact with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Leonardo da Vinci, and from  was patronized by Emperor Maximilian I. Meanwhile, an amazed pensioner has found that a piece of jewellery she was about to bin during a clearout is in fact a diamond worth £ million.

Max said: I am a huge fan of Friends, it was my favourite show growing up and the Thanksgiving episode with Rachel’s trle was definitely one of the best episodes. “My partner is American, and I have a lot of American friends, so I have celebrated Thanksgiving for a number of years. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. “I was re-watching this episode recently sparked an idea to recreate the trle and supersize it.” Max admitted that this challenge was as gross as it looks on the show. He added, “I really didnapost think it would be that bad, but I was really wrong! “Just a bit of the minced beef, peas and onions isnapost too bad, but having to eat so much it quickly got dficult. “The flavours managed to mingle with the custard early on and each spoonful did not look too bad, but when you took a mouthful, you realised just how much beef it had in it.” Despite the large quantity of trle, Max managed to complete the challenge in just  minutes.He said, “I thought it might take me around  minutes or more for this one, butI was really impressed with my time.  “I was really nervous throughout because I needed to get the recipe exactly right from the episode, and then go on to eat and finish it. “I didnapost originally plan on making it as big as it was, and the beef was present all the way to the bottom of the trle, which left me with beef stuck in my teeth!” Max prepared the mega dish entirely himself in preparation for the video. He added: “I topped it with whipped cream as per the recipe, but I also love spray cream so I just went all out and sprayed a can of it on top to add to the calories. “It took about an hour to prepare this for the video, but a large part of that was cooking the minced beef earlier on to ensure it was ready for layering.” Max holds a lot of nostalgia for the episode because of Joey’s hilarious realisation that he enjoys the trle, much to the disgust of the others at the table. Max said: “My favourite characters growing up were easily Joey and Chandler, who always used to have me in hysterics. “Joeyaposs reaction of being sweet and not wanting to let Rachel know she messed up the trle and finally finding it delicious is just incredible.” Max does not typically use pop culture recipes for his video inspiration, but he is now open to trying and taking on even more cinematic classics. He explained: “I do a lot of home food challenges normally, but this was a really unique opportunity for me.“I always love to hear from my audience through YouTube comments and Instagram, soanyone ever has any suggestions, I encourage them to send them in and I will try to take them on.“There will certainly be some more famous dishes from movies and TV shows in the future as well!”Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Itaposs no secret that the last  months have been incredibly dferent for new parents, whoaposve been forced to give birth alone and missed out on many face to face appointments.In fact, many parents of babies have grown frustrated at missing out on simple things, such as regular weigh-ins for their newborn babies, which is what led one mum to turn to supermarket scales. Tasha Moss was shopping in her local branch of Marks and Spencer in Reading, Berkshire, when she spotted the weighing scales in the fruit and veg aisle. With her -week-old son Freddie-Jay Moss in tow, she couldnapost quite resist the urge to stick the newborn on the scales after missing out on having the youngster weighed due to the pandemic. We were just walking past the fruit and veg aisle, Tasha said. I had Freddie in my arms, I had just finished feeding him, and I saw the scales. I said aposshall we quickly weigh him apos I havenapost had him weighed for so long, itaposs obviously not as accurate as the digital ones but itaposs given me a slight idea of what he weighs now. So, the -year-old wiped the tray with an anti-bacterial wipe and popped little Freddie-Jay in there, while carefully cradling and supporting his neck. A few seconds later she scooped him out, thrilled to finally find out how much he weighed. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The mum-of-three said: It was funny, usually he would cry at something like that but he loved it. It was reassuring to know that he is putting on weight and that Iaposm doing something right. Heaposs putting on weight so thataposs a good sign he must be healthy. The front of house team leader, who is currently on maternity leave, was thrilled to discover that Freddie-Jay, who was born weighing lb .oz, now tips the scales at lb oz. Tasha said: I think, especially for first-time parents, it can be worrying. You do wonder aposare they putting on weight  How much should they be eating apos I still do it with Freddie, you just want that reassurance that since heaposs last been weighed heaposs put on this much and itaposs all good.  Tashaaposs friend Natalie took a snap of baby Freddie-Jay in the scales, and later posted the picture on Facebook, writing: NO BABY WAS HARMED IN THE MAKINGWhen your best friend can’t get her baby weighed as no baby clinics running due to Covid .

As heavy snow is expected toto the UK just in time for winter, weaposve taken a look back at some of the most dramatic weather events to hit the nation.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.The Great Smog -  Dubbed as one of the most severe air pollution events to ever affect the capital, The Great Smog hit London in December of . Lasting four days before clearing, a thick layer of smog smothered the city - making visibility dangerously low.In fact, around , people died as a result of the pea-souper and , more were made ill by the event. According to the Met Office, the smoke-like pollution was so toxic it was alleged to have choked cows to death in the fields.The Great Smog of  may seem more like a pollution issue than a weather event - but itaposs actually a combination of both. Winter had gotten off to a very cold start with plunging temperatures and snowfalls across the region. So, in a bid to keep warm and avoid frostbite, the people of London naturally lit their coal fires to stay toastie. Usually, this wouldnapost cause an issue as smoke rises into the atmosphere where it disperses. However, an anticyclone, ie. an area of high atmospheric pressure where the air is sinking, was hanging over London. As a result, the warm smoke leaving the chimneys, as well as all of the pollutants pumping out of factories, got trapped - creating the ideal conditions for radiation fog.Britainaposs first sting jet -  A sting jet is basically a small area of very intense winds. Now, weaposre not talking about those blustery days where you have to hold your brolly from popping out, or your hat flying away. Sting jets are usually winds that exceed mph. Britainaposs first officially-documented experience with the phenomenon occurred in October of  and has been classed as one of the most damaging events to impact parts of the UK. Southeast England was battered with winds reaching a staggering mph - reportedly killing at least  people and knocking over millions of trees. The then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd went as far as describing the sting jet as the worst night since the Blitz. Scientists have since warned that the number of storms with exceptional wind speeds, like Britainaposs first sting jet may hit the UK, may doubleglobal warming continues to accelerate.How many of these weather events have you lived through, and how many can you remember  Take part in the survey below to have your say. Similar wind speeds to the sting jet were recorded on January  in . However, the Burns Day Storm affected a signicantly larger area than the  disaster - sweeping across southern Scotland and creating severe gales across many parts of Wales and England. Millions were left without electricity as the hurricane wind wreaked havoc on power supplies and phone lines - and fallen trees caused major disruptions to public transport and roads. Commonly referred to as Cyclone Daria, the Burns Day Storm also killed more than double the number of people than the sting jet that came three years before as it struck during daytime hours when millions were going about their day-to-day business. After raging through the UK, the violent storm, which began as a cold front over the Northern Atlantic Ocean, tracked east towards Denmarks and caused more deaths across Europe, including the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as floods in Germany.The hottest day in history -  Brits moan when itaposs not sunny and then moan even more when it is. But the heatwave of  was unbearable for even the most dedicated sun-worshipper. In Kent, recorded temperatures hit a stling .°C on August  - which remains a record-high to this day. And Brits werenapost the only ones sweltering that summer - with many European countries affected by the lack of rain and record-breaking temperatures. And while that temperature may not seem alarmingly high for some countries - the August heatwave was actually associated with a large short-term increase in mortality, particularly in London. Environmental think tank The Earth Policy Institutionactually claim that , people died as a result of the Europe sizzle - and warns that such deaths are likely to increase. “Though heat waves rarely are given adequate attention, they claim more lives each year than floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes combined,” the EPI said. “Heatwaves are a silent killer, mostly affecting the elderly, the very young, or the chronically ill.Boscastle flood -  Nestled on the north coast of Cornwall, England, the small village of Boscastle was savaged by a catastrophic flood on August  in . It started with heavy rainfall - more than mm in two hours to be precise - which consequently resulted in two river banksbursting.According to the BBC, this resulted in around two billion litres of water gushing into Boscastle - causing thousands of pounds worth of damage and sending residents into a frenzy.Cars were swept to sea, trees uprooted and buildings were damaged. However, nobody was killed and the village received a hefty donation from Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, to help rebuild the area. £. million has since been spent on a flood defence scheme - which includes making the river channel wider and deeper to be able to hold more water.Storm Kyrill -  Cyclone Kyrill was a low-pressure area that rapidly developed into a surprisingly violent windstorm that battered Europe. It originated in North America on January  and travelled across the Atlantic, hitting Ireland and England just two days later. Hurricane winds with gusts of up to a shocking mph then moved eastwards towards Poland and the Baltic sea - even managing to reach parts of Russia. An estimated , homes in England suffered power outages after pylons were damaged from the wind, and nearly  flights were cancelled at Heathrow Airport due to health and safety concerns.  people in the UK loss their lives from the storm - including a two-year-old boy who received severe head injuries and died in hospital after a wall fell on him. Across Europe, around  fatalities were reported, many from driving accidents caused by fallen trees or collisions.St. Jude storm -  Named after the patron saint of lost causes - St. Judeaposs storm saw winds touching mph pound the Isle of Wight as well as parts of Wales and England. Heavy rainfall also lashed areas of the UK on October  and  in  before crossing the North sea and reaching Denmark, where wind speed resulted in a record-high of . mph. Five people were killed from the storm - one couple losing their lives after a tree fell onto gas mains, causing an explosion. A -year-old boy was also swept out to sea. In comparison to the storm of  - five million fewer trees were destroyed and the total damage was nearly £billion less. Still, the gusts caused chaos to public transport and left , homes across the country without electricity.Hurricane Ophelia -  Forming in the Atlantic Ocean itself on October , , Storm Ophelia strengthened into a hurricane as it headed across the Azores, an autonomous region of Portugal. While it started to weaken on its journey towards the UK, it was still powerful enough to hit Ireland days later with record gusts of over mph recorded in Cork. Sadly, three people in Ireland were killed from the unprecedented storm and more than , people were without power. The arrival of Ophelia also brought Saharan dust to parts of the UK - which resulted in a hazy sepia-toned sky. Across parts of Devon, residents reported a strange burning smell which were attributed to forest fires over in Spain and Portugal.British Isles Heatwave -  June  was an extremely dry month across central and southern England - with London recording little or no rain for a staggering  days. It is this drought-like condition that contributed to drier soil, which can subsequently lead to increased temperatures. Similar to the heatwave of , Brits were subjected to scorching temperatures exceeding °C - resulting in a widespread drought, crop failures and a number of wildfires. There were fears of over , deaths during the heatwave - and warnings from experts about how intense temperatures will become more frequentglobal warming continues to accelerate.The heatwave was also blamed for record numbers of people admitting themselves to AE, as health bodies shed concern on how the NHS was under severe strain.

But when she got there and saw a long blond hair on the side, her mind was going all over the place. So I started doing some digging, she said. Thataposs when she went through his Facebook friends and through a process of elimination and deleted texts, she found the girl her boyfriend had been chatting to. Since being posted, the original video has racked up more than . million likes and comments. from people who applauded her excellent detective skills. One person said: Youaposre wild for that... but Iaposm here for it. Another wrote: First of all, excellent detective skills. A third commented: Imaginethe FBI field consisted of mostly females. Someone  put: our intuition is our superpower. After a number of people begged her to share how she found the deleted iMessages, she revealed all. In a follow-up video, she told people to click on aposFinderapos on a Mac computer, and type aposArchiveapos in the search bar. At the top, there should be a button that allows you to search for files on aposThis Macapos only - press that. Then select aposArchiveapos again. Then you will find your own messages from the day you bought your laptop or when you connected your iMessage. So, it has corresponding dates, it has corresponding times, it has all the numbers slash names of the people you have messaged on your Apple watch or on your phone. She says it doesnapost matteryou have deleted them from the devices, unless you physically go in and delete them from the files, they will be there.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

After the European Union’s health agency recommended boosters for all, it is expected to reveal new Covid- travel guidelines based on vaccination status, rather than country of origin.The new guidance will determine how long vaccinations should remain valid and give its recipients the subsequent freedoms to travel and enter venues.Some EU member states, such as France, have already set an expiration date on vaccine certicatesFrance has announcedthat after December , people over  will be allowed to enter restaurants, take an intercity train or attend cultural events onlythey have proof of a booster jab.Documentation of this booster jab will mean the pass stays valid. The new guidelines will not mean a ban on unvaccinated travel, according to iNews, a valid negative test uploaded onto the Covid pass will be a second option for travellers who have had their second jab more than six months earlier.  Travellers going down this route will have to be aware of the rules, and potentially pay for testing. There was not yet an overall consensus from the EU on how soon the Covid pass would expire after the second vaccine. Six, nine and  month periods had all been suggested. The move is aimed at clarying rules on free travel, as EU members adopt dferent approaches to managing booster jabs. The Commission’s move to rewrite the guidelines comes hot on the heels of the EU’s public health agency calling for vaccine boosters to be considered for all adults. “Countries should also consider a booster dose for all adults  years and older, with a priority for people above  years old,” said Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control . “There are still too many iniduals at risk of severe COVID- infection whom we need to protect as soon as possible. We need to urgently focus on closing this immunity gap, offer booster doses to all adults, and reintroduce non-pharmaceutical measures.” While rates of vaccination y widely between countries in the EU, only . per cent of the population is double jabbed.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has in recent weeks said there wereplans in the pipelineto add proof of a third dose of the vaccine to the NHS Covid pass. He said: I think that we will be making plans to add the booster to the NHS Covid travel pass.But again, I think what the general lesson is,anybody wants to travel, you can see that getting fully vaccinated with a booster is going to be something that will - on the whole - make your le easier in all kinds of ways including for foreign travel. So I would just say, you know,youaposre thinking about that, then this is yet another reason to get it done. Mr Johnson was later pressed on whether the concept of being fully vaccinated would need to be changed to include boosters. The PM told journalists: On boosters, itaposs very clear that getting three jabs - getting your booster - will become an important fact and it will make le easier for you in all sorts of ways, and we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full vaccination to take account of that. And I think that is increasingly obvious. The booster massively increases your protection - it takes it right back up to over %. As we can see from whataposs happening, the two jabs sadly do start to wane, so weaposve got to be responsible and weaposve got to reflect that fact in the way we measure what constitutes full vaccination. It comes after the UKaposs vaccine experts announced an expansion to the booster programme to extend the rollout to the over-s. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation issued a new recommendation for  to -year-olds to get a third dose, alongside a decision to offer a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to  and -year-olds. Mr Johnson warned that a surge in Covid cases in Europe could derail Christmas unless people get their booster jabs. While he said there was nothing in the data to suggest the country needed to move to Plan B of Covid measures, he warned that action could still be taken.

Now, the Daily Star reports, police are targeting people who sell the fashionable garments. A resident of Pyongsong, a city north of the capital Pyongyang, told Radio Free Asia that the coats have grown in appeal this year after leading women, including Kim Jong-unaposs sister and likely successor Kim Yo-jong, were spotted in them.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror The source said: Now the leather coat has become a symbol for powerful women too. As leather coats began to be recognised as a symbol of power, private clothing merchants asked trading company officials to import synthetic leather since September of this year. They copied the design of the leather coats worn by the Highest Dignity and the officials and now they are being sold in the marketplace. The resident added that police in Pyongsong recently started cracking down on both vendors and wearers, even though young men have been protesting against the new measures. Authorities have described the fashion fad as an impure trend to challenge the authority of the Highest Dignity, according to the resident.  Leather jackets, as opposed to full- trench coats, have actually been worn in North Korea since the early s, popularised by illegally smuggled South Korean films which circulate in provincial cities. Another resident, from the North Pyongan province, explained that coats are both imported from China and made domestically with imported materials. Rich entrepreneurs are able to import the fabric for the coats by placing an order with state-run trading companies who have partially resumed maritime smuggling, they explained. Although North Korea stopped trading with China in January  due to Covid, official smuggling by state-run firms resumed in part in April this year.A Chinese customs document seen by Free Asia Radio supposedly confirmed that dozens of metres of leather were imported into North Korea this month.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Kim Jong-unNorth Korea\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Letrsquos look at the dferent stages in the le of both types of trees.Real treesThe growing time for real trees is approximately - years to reach the most popular size of  ft . During that time, they provide habitat for wildle, capture carbon from the atmosphere, stabilise ground that is often unsuitable for other uses and reduce water run-off that can cause erosion.With estimated sales of in excess of seven million real trees sold in the UK every year, itrsquos clear that forestry also provides much-needed rural employment.You donrsquot need to worry about deforestation either: Christmas trees are a renewable resource, generally grown as a crop with up to  trees being planted for every two-metre tree that is cut down, ensuring that the environmental benefits of woodland are maintained and potentially even improved.As the seedling grows into a tree, itrsquos clear that real trees make positive benefits to our environment but once that tree leaves the forest or the nursery, your choices begin to matter.How can you help the environment  The first step is easy: buy a Scottish-grown tree from a local business and you minimise the carbon miles from the forest to your home.Most reputable garden centres in the area should be able to offer you a Scottish-grown tree, but other outlets may not. We recommend that you check the source before you buy!But itrsquos what happens to the tree after Christmas where you can make a real dference. Research shows that the way in which the tree is disposed of has considerably dferent environment effects.At one end of the spectrum, landfill is the worst possible solution for disposing of your Christmas tree, since decomposition and the release of methane negatively impact on the environment. Surprisingly, even burning the tree is preferable to landfill as that reduces potential emissions by over  per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, one of the most environmentally friendly solutions is to reuse the tree by chipping it for mulch or to compost it.Chipping simply accelerates the plant cycle that would occur naturally on the forest floor.This non-chemical process helps the tree break down more quickly than it otherwise would in the forest, naturally ing fibre and nutrients to the soil.Local authorities often offer a collect and chip service, and East Lothian Council have done so for a number of years now.Articial treesArticial trees, it is argued, are environmentally friendly because they can be re-used year after year and, for many, itrsquos the ideal solution for reasons of practicality and convenience. In fact, the key to determining whether an articial or a real tree is more environmentally friendly lies in the number of times you use the articial tree. Letrsquos consider the factors.Most articial trees are manufactured in China using plastic, PVC and metal, and these are then shipped to consumers around the world.The materials used in production and the global shipping distances involved in delivery combine to result in a considerable negative environmental impact from articial trees.And whilst the tree can be reused year after year, there still remains the problem of disposal at the end of its le articial trees are not recyclable and inevitably end up in landfill.According to the Carbon Trust, the carbon footprints for a m tree are:l Articial tree ndash kgl Real tree to landfill ndash kgl Real tree, chipped ndash .kg.Therefore, their advice is that you need to re-use your articial tree more than  times to equal the carbon footprint of a real tree that is responsibly disposed of. Many articial trees are not built to last that long and soyou decide that an articial tree is best for your lestyle, try to buy one that genuinely can be reused over at least  years.In conclusionCaring for our environment is a complex matter, andit only involved a single issue ndash such as the carbon footprint figures above ndash decisions would be easy. But itrsquos rarely that simple you only need to think about the many iables mentioned in this article to understand the complexity of the decisions we all have to make.We hope that this article offers you a brief overview that will help you decide which type of tree is best for you.As always, our plant team are happy to discuss the options with you and help you decide what tree ndash real or articial ndash is best for you.Theyrsquore also able to explain how you can get the very best from your tree and enjoy it throughout the Christmas

The current bus service impacts are:  Junction Road will be closed between Castle Streetand Tankerness Lane . Public Bus services affected are X,,,,,S and . Buses will turn left out of Travel Centre, left at Kiln Corner Roundabout, left at the Ayre Roundabout onto Great Western Road, rejoining routes on Pickaquoy Road .Works are planned for Outertown Road, Stromness, starting on Monday, November  to Thursday, December .Meanwhile, folk can expect roadworks on the A junction with Gorseness Road , on Friday, December  and Saturday .Roadworkers will be heading to the B road on Shapinsay between Housebay Cottage and Howe Farm, from Tuesday, December  to Thursday .On Monday and Tuesday - December, roadworks are planned for Old Finstown Road between Zions Loan and Kingsdale.The A St Mary’s, corner at The Inn, will be subject to roadworks from Monday, December  to Friday . The work is programmed to last for up to five days and will be carried out under road closure conditions in order for the folks involved to be as safe as possible. To reduce the impact of this, the closures will be restricted to am to .pm which should enable school transport to operate with a minimum of disturbance.Outwith the road closure times traffic will be restricted to using one side of the road and will be controlled by temporary traffic lights which will result in delays during busier periods.A ersion route will be in place via the Aand the B from St Andrews Primary School to the First Churchill Barrier.Stagecoach has advised that during the hours of am – :pm, the X commercial service from St Margarets Hope to Kirkwall will ert via the Kirkwall to Deerness road past St Andrews Primary School to the First Barrier and on to St Margaret’s Hope as per the existing timetable. Due to the change of route and possible disruptions, OIC asks passengers to allow   minutes on current scheduled times as there are likely to be delays.During the period of closure, there will be an additional X service in operation from Kirkwallas per the current timetable which will serve as far as St Marys and back for passengers residing in the Holm area. Therefore, the pick up  drop off point for passengers will be from Park of Ayre and therefore there will be no service between the First Barrier and Park of Ayre during the period of closure.Posters notying passengers of the ersions will be placed on the X service, Kirkwall Travel Centre and affected bus shelters. It should be noted that passengers can track buses across Orkney on the Stagecoach App which would provide accurate timings.OIC apologises for the inconvenience this will cause during the period of road closure. For further information on the X timetable during this time please contact Stagecoach on   or visitwww.orkney.gov.uk transport for timetable information.As for the council#s flagstone repairs, the works on John Street have been completed, with all barriers and signs now removed and the section reopened, today, Friday, November .In Victoria Street, from Bank Lane towards its junction with Ferry Road at the fountain works have been completed and reinstatements are curing with barriers expected to be removed next week. Access by the works area will been maintained.At Ferry Road, adjacent to the fountain, works have started and will continue next week, when the appropriate signs and barriers are erected. Access will be maintained.From Monday, November , works will commence on the section of Victoria Street from The Pier Bistro to the bottom of Church Road, with the section being closed to all vehicles. This section will be closed until the end of November.The works will then move onto Alfred Street, from December , starting at Hellihole Road junction, with the section up to the Lighthouse Pier access closed.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

It is the Home Office’s provider of asylum accommodation and support in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the North East of England.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mears said it matches accommodation to the service users’ needs. On arrival, there is an induction process and service users are asked to sign an induction form and occupancy agreement.They are not given a choice of dferent accommodation options and properties are “checked and prepared” prior to occupancy, a spokesperson for Mears said.However, amongst the issues identied by the Palestinian family when they moved in were a leak in the kitchen ceiling next to electric wires and the kitchen light which they say poses a fire hazard also a leak under the sink, no hot water and no heating and a broken fridge.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe cooker that was in the house when the family arrived. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe cooker that was in the house when the family arrived.Often issues go unreported because refugees fear thatconcerns are raised, they will face reprisals from the Home Office when they apply for asylum. BMCA and NWMF condemned the “squalid situation” asylum seekers are being made to live in. They said: “The public is largely unaware of the conditions into which traumatised people are routinely being dumped in and left to fend for themselves and or reach out to grassroots organisations for basic support.“This family have essentially been abandoned in a very unsafe house with a leaking roof near electrical equipment, with no kitchen utensils to even cook a meal which I am sure you appreciate, is the most basic necessity for any human being.“When asylum seekers arrive many are left stranded in limbo between their past and future as they wait to be granted asylum, a process that can be long, demeaning and bureaucratic.“Housing is a vital public service for people who really need the stability and the privacy that a safe home and a safe space can bring.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAnother leak under the kitchen sink. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAnother leak under the kitchen sink.“It is publicly funded and yet local authorities and governments are not holding these providers to account for the appalling conditions of these houses.“These range from leaking roofs, unsafe electrics, no heating and hot water for weeks among others.“We need to ensure that housing is safe, habitable, fit for purpose and adequately equipped. It is a basic human right and it needs to be treated as such.”Founder of NWMF, Lilian Seenoi-Barr said those who work in the sector have come across “too many examples” of vulnerable people in very unsafe accommodation, left without food or medical support.She added that companies and organisations funded to support them are failing at their duty of care to the most vulnerable people in society.She said asylum seekers have “essentially become a commodity” and “they are left to live in disgusting conditions at the same time subjected to racial abuse and harassment”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBroken radiator and rubbish lying around. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBroken radiator and rubbish lying around.A spokesperson for housing provider, Mears, said it procures and provides accommodation that is “safe, habitable and fit for purpose, meeting contractual requirements.”He added: “Repairs and maintenance issues do arise from time to time in accommodation and service users can report these directly to Mears, through our resident welfare managers, or to the independent ‘AIRE’ reporting service.“We will investigate any issues and take the required action, including carrying out repairs and maintenance promptly and safely.”BMCA and NWMF urged the UK Government to take immediate action to ensure that refugees and asylum seekers are treated humanely and have sufficient resources to meet their needs.They also asked the government to reconsider the rules on the right to work — as refugees come equipped with skills they want to use to contribute to the country giving them refuge.“The time has come to end this shameful practice and allow people seeking asylum to live in dignity,” they said.A Home Office spokesperson said it is dealing with an “unprecedented increase in asylum cases” but despite this has continued to ensure that the accommodation provided is safe and secure.“Belfast’s support for asylum seekers and refugees has been, and remains very welcome and we continue to engage with them on plans to house asylum seekers. We are satisfied that our contractors are meeting their obligations to provide suitable accommodation.”She added: “The Nationality and Borders Bill will deliver the most comprehensive reform in decades to fix the broken asylum system. It will make the system fairer and more effective so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum.”Most ReadMichelle O’Neill criticised after taking ministerial car to Sinn Fein event in DublinAlex KaneOpinionSay it quietly, but maybe Bertie Ahern was right about loyalists’ issues with Brexit ProtocolSouth East Antrim UDA believed to be behind threat to contractors working in Rathcoole estateArmagh brothers sentenced for £k tax fraudTired of the Troubles on TV  New crime drama Hope Street will be right up your streetTop VideosPlayStephen McKinney sentenced for the murder of Lu Na McKinneyPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandCourteney Cox congratulates Snow Patrol’s Johnny McDaid on Grammy nominationAllison MorrisOpinionStephen McKinney a person Lu Na should have been able to trust... instead he ended her leShameless… Garth Brooks superfans secure tickets for Croke Park gigs after waiting in queue of thousandsSinn Fein accuses DUP of blocking appointment of academic to human rights Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestEmily Atack and Asim Chaudhry to star inof Dating No FilterSharon Corr: Latest solo album was a rebirthLiverpool taxi driver saw ‘little red light’ on bomb vest, witness claimsCoronavirus NI: Young people urged to get jab at clinics this weekend – where to get your vaccineNearly two-thirds of over-s in some areas have had extra vaccine dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture Colm O#Reilly Belfast-- FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelfast city centre is expected to be busy for Black Friday salesClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailShoppers in Northern Ireland are expected to spend around £m on Black Friday deals alone, a leading economist has said.The ongoing pandemic means that most of that money will likely be spent online — a huge blow to the struggling high street retailers.Read MoreClaire McNeilly:OpinionBlack Friday: Streets or screens  The dilemma of big bargain ‘event’ and  deals to check outThe streets are, however, expected to be well populated with bargain hunters on what has become the biggest shopping day of the year.Dr Esmond Birnie told the Belfastthat shops here “will be hoping for a lot in both Black Friday and Christmas sales” after a “very trying” two years.The Ulster University senior economist also said there could be a gender imbalance when it comes to splashing the cash tomorrow.“The ious surveys out there are sending mixed messages as to whether Northern Ireland’s Black Friday spend per person will be up or down relative to  but there seems general agreement men will be spending more, on average, than women,” Dr Birnie said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Elsewhere, experts have said UK shoppers will part with almost £bn before December  to make up for last year#s cancelled Christmas, with a massive £.bn being spent on Black Friday goodies alone.Research by vouchercodes also forecast spending up to Christmas Eve will be £.bn higher than in  and £bn up on last Christmas, when Covid- lockdowns put paid to family gatherings.It can be daunting for consumers to navigate the murky world of what to buy and what to avoid in the sales, especially when watchdogs are constantly warning that Black Friday ‘offers’ are not always the best deals.So here, the Belfastanswers five questions on snaffling deals without getting ripped off:Q Will buying on Black Friday guarantee the best prices A No. An investigation by consumer group Which  found that nine in  Black Friday so-called deals from shops were cheaper or the same price before the same sales day last year. But remember that inflation and shipping costs are pushing up prices of some items by five to % compared to earlier in the year. So although a deal might seem pricier than you expect, it could still be cheaper than where.Q Is it better to wait until Cyber Monday before buying A If you find the product you want at a reasonable cost, after comparing prices where, do buy on Black Friday. Yet, prices on some products can fall even further on Cyber Monday, which falls on November  this year.Q Does Black Friday just last one day A No. Now the sales go on for a week, a month, or even longer.Q What about the Boxing Day sales A This is the other great time of year to get a good bargain.For Black Friday, retailers and manufacturers spend months negotiating knockdowns to offer shoppers. The same happens for what used to be called the January sales, but which now start on Boxing Day. But at this time of year, retailers are also running more clearances of items which didn’t sell well during the run-up to Christmas.Q Should I hit the high street or go online A Why not do both  Black Friday is becoming an internet phenomenon, with fewer shoppers in the shops compared to the panicked scenes of previous years. It can be easier to compare prices on your computer at home. But, in the spirit of supporting local retailers, remember that there will be tempting offers in the physical shops too.Meanwhile, ahead of the bumper sale bonanza, leading price comparison site money has analysed several of the most sought-after items and put together a handy guide on which products consumers should steer clear of.Fitness equipment: If you’re looking to spend big on a rowing machine, weight bench or treadmill, then you should wait until the new year. Brands know that one of the most common new year’s resolutions is to ‘get in shape’, so they ramp up the deals in January to take advantage of the booming market.Clothing: Most clothing retailers have jumped on the Black Friday bandwagon, so it will be possible to get good reductions this week. Butyou want to get the very best price, then you might be better off waiting. Brands run massive sales online and in-store throughout the year, especially in the weeks before and after Christmas.Cheap large screen TVs: Retailers drive footfall and get publicity on Black Friday by offering enormous K televisions for the lowest price they can get away with. It’s still possible to get a great deal on TVs on Black Friday, but onlyyou do your research.Off-brand models: Many retailers will offer very low prices on items from brands that you’ve never heard of on Black Friday. But while the discount might draw you in, you should remember that might be a reason you have never heard of the brand.Most ReadMichelle O’Neill criticised after taking ministerial car to Sinn Fein event in DublinAlex KaneOpinionSay it quietly, but maybe Bertie Ahern was right about loyalists’ issues with Brexit ProtocolSouth East Antrim UDA believed to be behind threat to contractors working in Rathcoole estateArmagh brothers sentenced for £k tax fraudTired of the Troubles on TV  New crime drama Hope Street will be right up your streetTop VideosPlayStephen McKinney sentenced for the murder of Lu Na McKinneyPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandCourteney Cox congratulates Snow Patrol’s Johnny McDaid on Grammy nominationAllison MorrisOpinionStephen McKinney a person Lu Na should have been able to trust... instead he ended her leShameless… Garth Brooks superfans secure tickets for Croke Park gigs after waiting in queue of thousandsSinn Fein accuses DUP of blocking appointment of academic to human rights Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestComedian Richard Herring has ‘defeated’ cancerEmily Atack and Asim Chaudhry to star inof Dating No FilterSharon Corr: Latest solo album was a rebirthLiverpool taxi driver saw ‘little red light’ on bomb vest, witness claimsCoronavirus NI: Young people urged to get jab at clinics this weekend – where to get your vaccine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The RNLI would advise people to stay out of the water during these stormy conditions.Swimming in large waves and rough seas can be dangerous where currents can drag someone away from the shore and in addition to that, the rough weather can make it dficult to spot someone in the water should they get into dficulty. Large waves can also make exiting the water dficult and increase the risk of injury.While stormy conditions may be tempting to watch, it is important to remember the sea is very dangerous and unpredictable and big waves can easily knock you off your feet.We would urge people to stay well back from the edge to avoid being swept in by large waves crashing over rocks and piers. As well as the risk of being swept into the sea, large waves can often undermine clf edges and make them unstable.If you think someone is in danger, please dial  or  and ask for the Coastguard.”Most ReadMichelle O’Neill criticised after taking ministerial car to Sinn Fein event in DublinAlex KaneOpinionSay it quietly, but maybe Bertie Ahern was right about loyalists’ issues with Brexit ProtocolSouth East Antrim UDA believed to be behind threat to contractors working in Rathcoole estateArmagh brothers sentenced for £k tax fraudTired of the Troubles on TV  New crime drama Hope Street will be right up your streetTop VideosPlayStephen McKinney sentenced for the murder of Lu Na McKinneyPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandCourteney Cox congratulates Snow Patrol’s Johnny McDaid on Grammy nominationAllison MorrisOpinionStephen McKinney a person Lu Na should have been able to trust... instead he ended her leShameless… Garth Brooks superfans secure tickets for Croke Park gigs after waiting in queue of thousandsSinn Fein accuses DUP of blocking appointment of academic to human rights Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestEmily Atack and Asim Chaudhry to star inof Dating No FilterSharon Corr: Latest solo album was a rebirthLiverpool taxi driver saw ‘little red light’ on bomb vest, witness claimsCoronavirus NI: Young people urged to get jab at clinics this weekend – where to get your vaccineNearly two-thirds of over-s in some areas have had extra vaccine dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms Hargey has said on several occasions she is committed to the reversal of social security service privatisation and ato in-house health assessments.SDLP communities spokesperson Mark H Durkan said he has been clear for years that in my view that Capita should not receive one penny more of taxpayer’s money for their administration of the Personal Independence Paymentsscheme.It is particularly galling to learn that they will now receive another £.m of public money over the next two years, he said.“We have repeatedly seen how the service offered by Capita not does provide value for money,” he said, adding that the y appeals process “leaves us with an even bigger bill to pay”.More signicantly this company leaves applicants traumatised due to the degrading and humiliating experiences they are subjected to and this should not have been allowed to continue,” he said.“This signicant amount of money could have been used to help deal with one of the many crises facing our people or gone towards reforming the PIP system or creating a way of evaluating those in receipt of welfare in a fair and humane way.Our Executive needs to cut its ties with Capita once and for all and stop rewarding these companies for their failure to adequately do their jobs. Minister Hargey also needs to provide clarity on her pledge to bring the assessment process in-house.DfC said: “To ensure value for money for the taxpayer, the Department for Communities has robust contract management arrangements in place.”Earlier this month, Capita apologised for any hurt caused to those going through the PIP process. Since , the firm has carried out around , assessments in Northern Ireland.Read MorePIP assessment firm Capita apologises for any hurt caused to applicantsCapita managing director Anthony King told MLAs on Stormont#s Communities Committee that the majority of PIP applicants have a high quality and empathetic experience, but he admitted this is not always the case.Often when things go wrong we can correct them very quickly, but in the small number of cases when things go wrong they can have very serious consequences for people and their families, he said.Obviously the more serious cases I am fully aware of and they can be deeply, deeply upsetting. I just want to take the opportunity today, in public, to say to anybody that has had a poor experience with Capita and been let down, that we are sorry. We do aspire to very high standards and we don#t always meet them we would like to apologise to those we have let down.Related topicsMark H.

The Moneyneena woman, along with her husband Chris and young son Oisin, had just moved into their new home in Portstewart weeks before lockdown hit in March . The  year-old was on maternity leave at the time and toyed with the idea of releasing her own music. After uploading one of her songs onto her social media account, Kate was spurred on to keep writing following a positive reaction to her music. “I have been writing songs since I was  but I just never really got the chance to go down this road properly,” explained Kate, who is better known in Ballinascreen as Catherine Kennedy. “It really all happened during lockdown and maternity leave. The whole world shut down so I kind of found myself needing a creative outlet so I went down this path and started off with one single and it turned into the whole album.” Growing up in rural County Derry, Kate was inspired by the musical talent all around her. “Ive loved music as long as I remember. Draperstown is a great hub for music,” the former St Eoghans Moneyneena and St Patricks Maghera student said. “The likes of Maurice Regan and Glasgowbury brought music into the town. I actually live a mile from Glasgowbury so Ive always looked up to the scene. “Ive worked in Danny Ottersons music shop in Maghera and I worked in the Empire Music Hall as well when I was younger so I always had lots of music around me.” Even though she has been singing at wedding ceremonies and other events in local churches since the age of , with some encouragement from her older brother, Kate decided to explore songwriting. “My brother bought me a guitar for my seventeenth birthday and suggested I maybe try and write some of my own songs, so thats when it all started and it was always a nice distraction from doing A-levels,” she said. Fast forward  years and Kate has just released her second single Wrong Side of the Town from her upcoming debut album Fallen from Grace, due for release in the New Year. The new single, which features the unmistakable vocals of Cormac Neeson, lead singer of The Answer and successful solo artist. Despite the new song only being released five days earlier, Hotpress announced it as its track of the day on Wednesday. On Friday night past, Kate and Cormac performed the song live for the first time at an In the Round night of music with Sound of Belfast in the Empire Music Hall. The gig was one which Kate had been dreaming about for some time. “I used to glass collect thereand I used to look up at that stage and listen to all the amazing music so its a bit of a dream that this is happening,” said Kate. “Im a really big fan of Cormacs. He was one of the acts that stood out to me when I worked in the Empire. He was playing in his band The Answer and I had to rub my eyes to check it wasnt Robert Plant. He has just one of the best voices in the industry, I think. “I worked with Mojo Furys frontman, Michael Mormecha for the album and I told him that I would love Cormac to sing on this song and he just asked him and sent him the song and he said he was up for it. “Its really funny, a year before this all came about, I was at a gig and Cormac was playing at it. I said to my husband Chris how cool would he be on Wrong Side of the Town  I had the song written and had this all in my head and its happened. Its pretty cool how it worked out. “This is one of my favourite songs to date. I love the blues rock sound we have achieved using inspirations from some Deep South Americana  Blues music and some soundtracks I love, such as True Detective and Sons of Anarchy. “Wrong Side of the Town explores the often fine and blurry line that can exist between having a really great time, and that of self destruction. The song aims to look at this from ious angles.” Kate, who recently became a mum for the second time to baby Tomas, now three months-old, admits that her music doesnt fit neatly into any category and she is heavily influenced by a iety of artists. “I love a big range of music but Dolores ORiordan of The Cranberries is one of my icons. I also like Amy Winehouse. Theres also a big American theme running through my music,” she continued. “I call it alternative country rock – the closest thing to it would be Sheryl Crowe - it doesnt fit neatly into any category.” So, with her newest single receiving rave reviews and an album launch just around the corner, Kate says she is looking forward to more live performances and is even thinking about her next project. “Ive been delighted with the reaction to the singles – Wrong Side of the Town and Street Lamps - I got really great support for it and Im just looking forward to getting the whole album out and hopefully there will be a nice celebration for it. “Im also looking forward to being able to perform to a live audience. Ive played live over Zoom through a group called Mothers in Music with the Oh Yeah Music Centre who have been really supportive. “Charlene Hegarty from Maghera is the talent development officer with the Oh Yeah Music Centre and she has been helping us Mothers in Music as a group. Its been lovely to have her support. “Theres just something very special about playing live in front of real people. Its so dferent compared to performing over Zoom – its like night and day. Zoom was brilliant for the times that were in it but live music is where its at. Theres just something about the atmosphere and having people in the room at the same time. “Thinking about the future, I love Irish traditional music as well so Im kind of thinking along those lines for the next project maybe. Its something a bit dferent.” Kate says she enjoys making the trip home to Moneyneena once or twice a month and says she is delighted with the support she has received from locals. “I love Moneyneena. Its a gorgeous part of the world. I am delighted to still be living in County Derry, so Im not too far away. “Ive been really taken aback by how supportive people have been. Ive had really nice support and I couldnt be more grateful for their support and encouragement but I dont take anything for granted. Im just going to enjoy it,” she added.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

He said: “There is no denying that the winter period will present a huge challenge for already struggling households. “The cruel cuts to Universal Credit, spiralling energy costs and the economic fallout of the pandemic have created a perfect storm. “Yet despite persistent calls for an emergency support package or a Household Support Fund similar to that announced in England in September for vulnerable families, the Minister rests on her laurels. “Minister Hargey cannot laud the North’s ‘unique’ Discretionary Support Scheme as a cure-all amidst the unfolding cost of living crisis. “A scheme, which she seems to have forgotten failed serve its intended purpose of protecting people here, evidenced in theof pound million of unspent funds. “Again, Minister Hargey’s lackadaisical approach to protecting the vulnerable and in this case, outright dereliction of duty will leave people without adequate support at a time when they need it most.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.    The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.    Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Seaacuten Mellon, one of the clubs founders and a man whose influence on hurling in the city has touched almost every club, passed away on Friday. The senior hurlers were at training when they heard the news, with centre back Breandaacuten Quigley tweeting his condolences afterwards. “It was with deep sadness I heard of the passing of Seaacuten Mellon, an absolute Titan of hurling andof hurling in the city,” he said, “Probably fitting that we were informed of his passing while on the field. It’s oft said, but we really will never see the likes of him again.” Mellons legacy is a hurling side whose stock continue to rise. Action from Lavey v Na Magha in Ballyarnett earlier this year. They competed well in this years Antrim league, reaching the Division  semi finals where they were defeated by a strong Cuacutechullains Armagh side. Championship action in Derry though, has proved both frustrating and disappointing. The frustration stems from the fact the club were denied a chance to compete in a county final following the withdrawal of opponents Eoghan Rua. The Coleraine side had come through a bruising senior football encounter with Slaughtneil the previous week, and the decision caused anger and frustration in Ballyarnett. Derrys hurling championship provided plenty of games for the city men, but results were disappointing given the elevated standard of those they faced. Attacking talisman Deacuteaglaacuten Foley. They lost all four group games by an average margin of  points, coming closest to Ballinascreen in their final outing, where they lost by nine. The defeats skew their statistics. They have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. At the other end, they have shipped - , an average concession per game of . points. In comparison, Cootehill have had four championship games, in which they have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. A concession of -leaves an average concession of . points per game. Na Magha will point in mitigation to the standard of teams they had to play in a group that contained senior runners-up Kevin Lynchs, and there is no doubt the dficulty of the Derry championship is greater. Personnel wise, the threat from the Cavan champions arises from full forward Diarmuid Carney, who registered - in the county final, with - coming from play. Cootehill celebrate lting the Cavan title. Half back Fiachra Hughes hit - for Celtic, while their two goals came from midfielder Oisiacuten Carolan and corner forward James McKay. For Na Magha, the experienced Breandaacuten Quigley will hope to drive his side on from the heart of defence, while they have a number of pacey forwards who will trouble Cootehill. Keelan Doherty tortured defences in Antrim all year, while Deacuteaglaacuten Foley, Timothy Rankin and Padraig Nelis all carry an attacking threat. A .pm throw-in away in Cavan adds another layer of dficulty, but the Derry side are no strangers to adversity, and in a week where they lost a club legend, will be determined to come home with the win. CHAMPIONSHIP STATS    Deep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away  Seaacuten Mellon was one of the founding members of Na Magha CLG.    Derry junior hurling final cancelled  The game had been due to take place on Sunday.    Defeat for Na Magha in league semi final  The Ballyarnett men were battling for a place in the Antrim Division  hurling league final.

Na Magha will point in mitigation to the standard of teams they had to play in a group that contained senior runners-up Kevin Lynchs, and there is no doubt the dficulty of the Derry championship is greater. Personnel wise, the threat from the Cavan champions arises from full forward Diarmuid Carney, who registered - in the county final, with - coming from play. Cootehill celebrate lting the Cavan title. Half back Fiachra Hughes hit - for Celtic, while their two goals came from midfielder Oisiacuten Carolan and corner forward James McKay. For Na Magha, the experienced Breandaacuten Quigley will hope to drive his side on from the heart of defence, while they have a number of pacey forwards who will trouble Cootehill. Keelan Doherty tortured defences in Antrim all year, while Deacuteaglaacuten Foley, Timothy Rankin and Padraig Nelis all carry an attacking threat. A .pm throw-in away in Cavan adds another layer of dficulty, but the Derry side are no strangers to adversity, and in a week where they lost a club legend, will be determined to come home with the win.

The ladies were quick to remind him they had tasted the adrenaline of the provincial stage, but for the men, currently waiting in the wings, this is uncharted territory. Although Sean Dolans made things sticky for them, St Martins eventually pulled away for a ten-point win which secured back-to-back junior titles. They leave a great deal of created history in their wake. The  crown, won in , was the clubs first junior title since , and they became the first team to win the championship twice within one calendar year last month. Desertmartin management team. ONeill says the players are keenly aware they are living through history. “Its a great place to be in really,” he said. “None of these boys have ever had this opportunity and there are boys round training saying theyve never trained in November before. “I know the weather hasnt been great, but you can see the boys want to be there and they want to grab this opportunity with both hands. “We also have to be mindful that we may never get this opportunity again, so its about making the most of it while we are here. “There are clubs who have had success over the past few years, that have been going in Ulster and they know what theyre at, whereas its new to our boys. “At the minute, were making the most of it.” The double junior champions will be without Ryan McGuckin, who suffered a broken jaw in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, while Marty Breen is again an injury doubt. Enda McGuckin Desertmartin are yet to concede a goal in championship football this season, and have conceded a paltry - across their five games. A total of -at the other end leaves them averaging . points per game and an average concession of just  points per game. In Derry, they have been almost impenetrable. Their opponents, St Patricks Donagh, are coming from a similar favourites position in Fermanagh. Like Desertmartin, they were tipped to win the championship and duly did so. Managed by Ballinascreen man and former Derry ladies manager Paul Hasson, they saw off neighbours Newtownbutler in the Fermanagh final. Across four championship games, they conceded - , leaving an average concession rate of  points per game, but their total at the other end may point to Desertmartins toughest test yet. Donagh celebrating their Fermanagh title. Donagh have racked up -in four games, only failing to find the net once in their opening-day defeat, also against Newtownbutler. They have averaged . points per game, something that may raise a few eyebrows in the Derry sides defence, and manager Kevin ONeill says it will be a massive test. “Ive seen a few videos of them, so Ive been able to watch a couple of their games. They won Division  in Fermanagh and are probably playing in a championship below where they should be,” he said. “They were favourites to win it and they went on and won it, which is testament to them putting their shoulder to the wheel and responded to a wee bit of pressure. “They have a lot of experience in their team theyre big and physical, so we definitely wont be taking them lightly.”  The club has been the centre of a real buzz since the county final. The club held their dinner dance, giving a chance for everyone to celebrate their achievements. A breakfast event has been organised for the morning of the game, before a bus will transport supporters to Enniskillen. ONeill says the players have to prepare a little dferently. “You probably dont realise it when youre just going to training, but there is a huge buzz around the place,” he said. “Theyre making the most of this opportunity and everybody in the club is aware that this doesnt come around too often and we want to make the most of it when it does. “Its the biggest game of these boys club careers, but so far theyve answered everybodys questions when the pressure has come on. “Its been a long wait, really four weeks is a long time, but well take an Ulster campaign no matter how long we have to wait.” CHAMPIONSHIP STATS    KEY PLAYERS DESERTMARTIN Lachlan Murray  Murray, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry, is a precocious talent. He has the ability to unlock a packed defence and has a willingness to work hard to find shooting opportunities Equally comfortable playing on the loop and taking men on to go directly through the middle, he is a player who will certainly be on the radar of the Fermanagh men. DONAGH Brian McDermott A - haul from full forward McDermott helped Donagh to victory in the Fermanagh final, and the full forward has time again proved the focal point for his sides attacking options. He hit consecutive hattricks in the games against Brookeborough and Coa, and flanked by the very able Eimhin Curran and Ryan Kelly, who both scored goals in the final, he is a formidable opponent.

We wish both loyal players well.Annahilt C moved to the top of the Intermediate Section with a hard fought - victory over Banbridge D.Mervyn Cairns in the top two singles games was too experienced for Maya Forsythe and Katherine McConnell, while Jack Shaw kept up his winning run with good wins over Anna and Trevor Russell.James Cairns also added two more wins to his CV.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

The summary for policy makers alone runs to  pages. To measure that change is actually happening, it uses a mixture of scientic measurements from the environment, like temperature, the composition of gases in our atmosphere, and the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.John Barry is professor of Green Political Economy at Queen’s University in BelfastUsing a mixture of state of the art models dferent scenarios are explored to model the climate that has been observed historically. These sophisticated models take into account both human sources of warming and natural sources of warming. When the contribution of humans to warming is built into these models then they can better predict the way our climate has warmed. Human sources of warming include emissions of gases like Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide, called Green House Gases. These gases when released at a massive scale influence atmospheric composition and create a greenhouse effect that leads to global heating. In contrast, natural sources of known warming include solar radiationand volcanic activity. When the models include natural sources of warming alone, they cannot capture the change in temperatures that we see happening now. It is only when human and natural sources of warming are built into the models that they capture past warming trends. This is a summary of the scientic evidence for human induced global heating and climate change. Mark Emmerson is a professor in the Institute for Global Food Security at Queens University in Belfast However, the Glasgow Climate Pact, the title given to the document agreed at COP, demonstrates a worrying gap between what the science tells us and whatleaders and countries are willing to do in terms of climate action. Reading the Pact there is a stark contrast between the language used in the scientic sections and the rest of the document. In those scientic sections, we find language that is not usual in such diplomatically negotiated documents, including terms like ‘Science and urgency’, ‘Expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around . °C of warming to date’, ‘Notes with serious concern’. In disciplines with staid standards of scientic writing, this is the equivalent of scientists shouting at the top of their voices that humanity is not on the right path to recognising the dangers ahead, and that a serious course correction is desperately needed. This is why many were bitterly disappointed at the outcome of the conference – its failure to ‘phase out’ coal, oil and gas – the main causes of greenhouse gas emissions. Arguably, this was because the single biggest delegation to the conference was not a country, but rather the fossil fuel industry. Given that the science is clear, that we need to move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible, the lobbying power of the coal, oil and gas sector was evident in the outcome. Let’s not also forget the role played by major carbon energy exporting countries such as Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia, and major coal users such as China and India.It has been argued that the s need to be a decade of action, of innovation in research, allowing for nature to recover to play a role in mitigating carbon emissions, whilst creating a sustainable economic recovery following the pandemic. COP make the efforts to decarbonise our economies much harder. Finally, we need to recognise climate deniers, refusing to accept that climate change is the result of human activity. As the countries and fossil fuel lobby mentioned above, they will have to account for themselves in the eyes of people facing the immediate impacts of climate change and future generations. Those in the global south, whose voices were so eloquently heard at COP, face suffering and deathin the years ahead. As academics and scientists, we have not used those terms lightly. Equally, we see ‘climate delayers’ who caution against urgent action now and support must less ambitious climate action. This is the equivalent of finding one’s house on fire but allowing it to burn brighter so you can better see what you aredoing. Climate delay is perhaps the new climate denial.Climate science has spoken, but so too have the people, those protesting outside the conference demanding ambitious climate action, and indeed history may record that it was those outside the negotiations not inside that had both science on their side and were on the right side of history.• John Barry is professor of Green Political Economy at Queen’s University in Belfast and Mark Emmerson is a professor in QUB’s Institute for Global Food Security——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
