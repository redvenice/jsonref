She is very good at it. Everyone involved with her initiative at Smart Works, a small charity that helps disadvantaged women get into the workplace, was immensely impressed by her input. Her contribution went well beyond making a token appearance and showing an interest. She came up with the idea of designing and selling product to raise funds and profile and gave an inspiring speech without notes at the launch.This is a woman who knows what she can achieve and what she is worth. As Meghan Markle, B-list actress in a successful TV series, that calculation was relatively straightforward.         One of the aspects of Royal life Meghan will have found most difficult is not being allowed to voice an opinion, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan during her and Harry\u0027s secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)For Harry, as Duke of Sussex and sixth in line to the British throne, there was similar clarity. But as second-tier Royals roaming the world on the speaker circuit, making red-carpet appearances, endorsing products and occasionally appearing on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, the rules of engagement become very murky. Right now the Sussexes are hot.Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal. Things change. In the world of celebrity, you are always having to watch out for the new kid on the block. Fame is a greedy beast that has to be continually fed.Until now, their working life of Royal tours, walkabouts, visiting disaster zones and being guests of honour at charity events has automatically fuelled and burnished their profile. But without the very special imprimatur of first-tier Royalty, the kind of power and influence they currently enjoy may not survive in the long term – especially if they are cashing them in to gain financial independence.The celebrity circuit is complex and quite brutal. If you become known as an easy gun for hire to the highest bidder, in a short time your currency drops. You can spend a few years giving hugely lucrative speeches for international hedge-fund dinners, and being on the advisory board of a bioersity start-up in Qatar, but to give this existence longevity you have to keep replenishing your worth – whether that is in the degree of your fame or in exceptional talent or knowledge.         Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan and Harry during their secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)Unanchored celebrity has a built-in obsolescence. It’s hard to understand why they are swapping a profile that confers automatic and eternal worldwide fame for one where your worth will be in part measured by your number of Instagram followers and dependent on the skill of your marketing team.This kind of celebrity is also reliant on exposure, and not simply the exposure that you selectively chose to put out on your own social media sites. The relentless commentary of media of every kind is part of the deal and, if anything, the Sussexes may well be less protected in this new world than they felt in their old. Every move they make will be analysed and scrutinised and if they are being paid handsomely for it, they will no doubt be regarded as fair game.This weekend Meghan is back in Canada with her son while Harry is at home hammering out the details of their future. I hope he has some time out and manages to catch up with old friends.The couple are no doubt exhilarated by having made the decision to cut loose and get their plans out in the open. Almost certainly, they will be looking at the future and see it glittering with opportunity. Which it could be. If they don’t take their position for granted.But if they are hoping to build a new life that trades on royalty without fulfilling the more difficult obligations that come with it, which is reliant on the toxic mirage of fame without worth, not that many years down the line they could be looking at a very different picture."},{"url":null,"title":"The vicious rivalry Meghan Markle Kate Middleton super fans","story":"Share this article ‘The QUEEN is also off limits as are the York girls.’On the other side, there is equal vehemence.

Kate is pictured above on her birthday earlier this weekUnsurprisingly, it is seen differently by Meghan’s devotees. They view the decision as empowering, an Independence Day for the couple – a sign, perhaps, of The Sussex Squad’s more transatlantic community. ‘It’s a huge decision,’ says one fan, addressing the couple. ‘But you are both strong enough to follow your dreams and I admire your choice.’Bella, 20, from Liverpool, who runs Instagram accounts dedicated to both Royal women, says drawing comparisons ‘comes with the territory’. ‘Her Majesty and Princess Margaret were always compared, as were Fergie and Diana and even Pippa and Kate,’ she said.‘The fact that Kate and Meghan are both beautiful, intelligent women doesn’t help, as people always want to criticise everything they do and say. It’s foolish to compare them because they’re completely different and independent people. I think they’re both inspirational in their own ways.’That may be so.

Based just off Broadway Market, it supports practitioners in a variety of disciplines, from visual artists to musicians to theatre companies. Not long after setting it up in 2008, I decided I wanted to make the project international. As I have roots in Nigeria, and the creative scene there is so exciting, Nigeria seemed like the right place to do it.About eight years ago, I acquired some land in Lagos. Now we’re in the process of building a residency in Lekki, a rapidly developing area in the east of the city. It will house three artists at a time, with studio and gallery spaces on the ground floor, and residents’ bedrooms above.The project also extends to a 30-acre farm in Ijebu, three hours northeast of Lagos. We’re in the process of landscaping and building a barn house and studios for artists, using sustainable materials such as mud, as well as a walled garden where people can learn about indigenous plants. Lagos is a very busy urban area with a lot of nightlife and music, so Ijebu will be for artists who need a more quiet space to produce work on a larger scale (there also will be a sculpture garden on the farm).The Guest Artists Space (G.A.S.) Foundation, as the new project is called, will be a two-way exchange. International visitors will be able to offer advice and support to local artists, but they will also receive knowledge. There’s so much to learn in Africa, and so many amazing artists and intellectuals, and the project spaces will provide a platform for exchange, for debate, for collaboration. There will be opportunities for visitors to work alongside African artists, to debate alongside them, to explore work, and leave with a completely different perspective. I’ve done residencies myself in the past and I always come back with a changed view of the world.African artists have always been there, doing fantastic work, and the rest of the world is only just catching up. When I was growing up in Nigeria in the 1970s, the music scene was incredible, thanks to artists such as Fela Kuti, and culture was very much part of my early experience. The arts suffered under the military regime in the 1980s and 90s, but Nigeria is more democratic now and the liberal arts are thriving again. The city has the Art X Lagos art fair, which draws collectors and artists from around the world. The middle class is growing and people have more disposable income. And there is still so much untapped potential. I see what’s happening in Nigeria and across the continent as a kind of African renaissance.As well as facilitating cultural exchange and giving artists a space to work in, I want this project to support the local ecosystem and economy. In Ijebu, I have employed 12 farm workers, installed five greenhouses (growing tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables) and planted two acres each of maize, plantain and cassava. The point of all this is to help develop food security and sustainability in an area where unemployment is high and food supply is precarious. Bringing people to the farm, for arts events as well as residencies, should also provide a boost for the local economy.There have been challenges along the way. I’ve learned that when you’re doing a building project, you have to be extremely patient with things like planning permission. And when you set up a foundation, you have to listen to the board of trustees. You can’t just go ahead and do things yourself, like you would in a studio.But the project is coming together. The farm is operational now and we should have the buildings and project spaces finished by the end of 2020. The building in Lagos will be ready by mid-2021 – I may launch it to coincide with the art fair in November that year. And we’ve got a very interesting, erse range of trustees on our board, including artists El Anatsui, Njideka Akunyili Crosby, and Olafur Eliasson.As with the space in London, the residencies in Nigeria will be multi-disciplinary, rather than focusing narrowly on visual arts. Each residency will last three months, but we also want to offer long-term support for inidual artists, equipping them to thrive not just survive, and I will be collaborating with other institutions and iniduals to achieve that.International exchange has a very strong value, especially in a world where there’s a great deal of conflict, and I believe that going to see other cultures, and being creative with other cultures, is really a very positive way forward. It can be a true vehicle for social change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f90914c7ab37b15b05a1f55d2db0ef56b5292061/0_0_1560_2000/master/1560.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6deb74b87b7f530d6bde54c55172b7a6 700w","title":"avoid uk recession by kickstarting green economy says thinktank","story":"New Economics Foundation calls for £50bn to reboot economy on greener footingThe government fightback against the next recession should include pumping as much as £50bn into green projects, in a move that would help reboot the economy and tackle the climate emergency, according to a left-leaning thinktank.Against a backdrop of concern among economists that Britain is ill-equipped to combat another downturn on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis, the New Economics Foundation thinktank said a green plan to beat a future slump was required.Leading economists including former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, have called on governments around the globe to prepare for future economic shocks with readily available blueprints to raise government spending.It comes as central banks, including the Bank of England, have limited capacity to provide support because interest rates remain close to the lowest levels on record more than a decade after the financial crisis. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, has hinted that Threadneedle Street could cut rates soon, while warning that it is running out of ways to combat recessions.The foundation said that raising investment in green infrastructure was required regardless of whether Britain was facing a recession or not. However, it said that a plan for fighting a future downturn should have decarbonisation at its core.Rolling out an expansive green spending round would help the government to avoid mistakes made responding to the last recession, the thinktank said, arguing that ministers missed an opportunity to decarbonise the economy following the 2008 slump.For a future spending package, it said the response should be spread over three years, with as much funding for green projects as possible made available in the first year to ensure the package has the most impact.Frank van Lerven, senior economist at the NEF, said: “The failure to respond to the last recession by scaling up investment to tackle environmental breakdown in a socially just way was a missed opportunity. And it’s an opportunity we cannot afford to miss again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78bd1a3dc6548f62a8bd0dc0ed9a3d2e288716b4/277_0_2889_1734/master/2889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fed5f904a03910a8c1a68ffabaaf4d4","title":"polluting vehicles could be pulled from uk sale say carmakers","story":"New fines for breaches on CO2 limits will clash with Britons’ taste for higher-emission SUVsCarmakers could pull models from the UK, the automotive industry has warned, as Britain’s taste for polluting vehicles clashes with the difficulty of meeting post-Brexit carbon dioxide limits.Under new EU rules, average carbon dioxide emissions of almost all cars sold in 2020 and 2021 across the single market, including the UK, must fall below 95g a kilometre, with heavy fines for carmakers that miss inidual targets designed to meet the goal.The heavier, fuel-inefficient SUVs favoured by Britons have been offset by the smaller, less polluting cars preferred in countries such as Italy. But after Brexit, when the UK plans to copy EU rules, this will no longer be the case, making a UK-only limit harder to hit.“It could be that you see a reduction in consumer choice through the removal of higher-emitting vehicles from not just the top end, but particular segments.”Mel Evans, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Carmakers are not obliged to aggressively market heavy, polluting cars. They know that we are in a climate emergency and yet keep accelerating towards the cliff edge, because bigger, dirtier cars have higher profit margins. And because they use more petrol and diesel, the oil companies cash in as well.“To address the climate crisis, manufacturers need to U-turn on petrol and diesel, stop spending millions drumming up demand for their dirtiest cars, and focus on electric vehicles for a post-oil world.” The carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold to British consumers rose for the third year in a row in 2019, underlining the scale of the challenge for the industry as it tries to meet the new EU limits.However, the prospect of an imminent Brexit at the end of January will force carmakers to make choices before the end of 2020, when the implementation period is scheduled to end and the UK-only limits kick in. That could include choosing to sell electric cars in the EU rather than the UK if they judge Europe to be a more important market.Carmakers are rushing to bring to market new electric cars with zero exhaust  emissions – including Volkswagen’s ID.3, Vauxhall’s Corsa-e and an electric Fiat 500 – this year, but production will initially be limited as factories gear up. At the same time, they are keen to hang on to their profitable but polluting sales of internal combustion engines.Al Bedwell, an analyst at the car consultancy LMC Automotive, said he expected some higher-polluting models to be withdrawn from sale across both the EU and the UK in the next two years. However, he said major efforts to increase sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) might not work in the absence of consumer demand.“You can’t suddenly create a perfect environment to sell enough BEVs to make the problem go away,” he said.The Department for Transport said: “Our priority is to protect everyone from unsafe vehicles, including those that are damaging our environment, which is why we continue to work with industry to improve the emissions standards of all vehicles.“We have set out bold plans for driving down CO2 emissions and committed in our ‘Road to Zero’ strategy to pursue vehicle emissions regulation that is at least as ambitious as the current arrangements as we leave the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1083d0cdf1b59ba0e6ab4c1785d34b56bbcd732/0_0_2857_2105/master/2857.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d9690ceaa385b0caf7194b2c170d7b0f 1760w","title":"guardian cities farewell from the editor","story":"In six years  Cities has grown into a community of journalists, experts and readers joined by a desire to make cities better. Now it’s time for a changeSince its founding six years ago,  Cities has grown from a small experiment into a huge community. Together – as editors, writers, photographers and film-makers, along with architecture experts, urban planners, gentrification activists, cycling evangelists, canalboat dwellers, homeless people, theatre-makers, refugees and the rest of a motley crew of contributors and readers from nearly 600 cities – we have tried to shape how the world understands urbanisation: namely, as one of the truly transformative global phenomena of the 21st century.We started  Cities because we saw that everywhere on Earth, people were flooding into cities. More concrete was poured in the last couple of years in China than the US used in the entire 20th century. China now has 100 cities with more than 1 million people, while some developing megalopolises in Africa and elsewhere may hit 80 million residents the 100 million city is no longer a fantastical proposition. Most of this growth has been largely unplanned, with people literally building their own houses and roads – though what some consider slums are really just the roots of new neighbourhoods.The challenges can seem overwhelming. The new desirability of cities has seen millions of poorer residents kicked out of their homes, sometimes literally bulldozed for expensive apartment towers. Air pollution from cars, particularly diesel engines (sold to us as safer, and only now revealed as the opposite), chokes many streets, hurting children in particular. The climate crisis threatens us with overheating and floods. Poverty remains a scourge. The concretisation of our environment can, if we’re not vigilant, cut us off from the natural world, turning vibrant human societies into bloodless mechanised economies.But if cities are places of great inequality and tumultuous change, they are also hives of innovation – to paraphrase Homer Simpson, both the cause of, and solution to, so many of our problems. Ignore the haters: cities writ large are safer, healthier and more productive than any other form of human habitation. Despite the rise of the internet, it remains in cities where people are best able to gather, exchange ideas and test out solutions. We are rewilding, cycling, densifying and in some cases even floating. In five years Copenhagen may become the world’s first carbon-neutral city. Tolerance and difference are at their highest in cities. They certainly aren’t for everyone, but more people can live together in cities, with less total impact, than in any other form of habitation.Our journalism has tried to tell these stories in many ways. Our pioneering “live week” concept took us to the world’s great megacities: Mumbai, São Paulo, Mexico City, Moscow, Tokyo, Jakarta. We have looked at how we live now asked great living artists to show us their cities looked at cities as they might have been and illustrated the surprising ways they actually are. We’ve profiled the living and the dead, traced the story of cities back 6,000 years, celebrated the most important buildings and exposed privately owned public space. We’ve tried to reinvigorate photojournalism, made films, published long reads, designed interactives, sailed canal boats, hosted live events and told jokes.2019 was a particularly vibrant year for us. Our  Concrete Week series on the evils of cement won the Foreign Press Association Award for Environment and Science. The empty doorway, our series of profiles of the lives of people who died homeless, took home the British Journalism Award for Features, and our revelation of the segregated playgrounds scandal was nominated for Campaign of the Year. We earned several other awards for our cycling and mobility coverage and the illustrated city series. We published our first print supplement, the Canal Revolution, in collaboration with the lovely folks at the Observer, and made a global documentary series, on ided cities. Last but not least I’ve hosted a podcast, launching shortly, about the songs that shaped cities at crucial moments in their history.Now, however, it’s time for a change. After many years of renewed generosity from the Rockefeller Foundation, whose arms-length support meant that we retained full editorial independence in every way, Cities is closing its doors. As an exclamation point, Cities will conclude this week with something we have generally avoided: expressing some forceful opinions, outright. We have normally focused as much as possible on original reported journalism, telling the stories of how the lives of citizens are changing, using their own words. But now we will make the case for five big, ambitious interventions that we think could improve cities for the better. Please read them. Tell us if you agree with them. We want these declarations to stand as an encouragement for new efforts to help further the cause of improving our cities, and for other journalists to take up the ever-fascinating story of our cities.In the meantime, I’d like to thank our staff, who have collectively made Cities what it was: my inspiring predecessor Mike Herd, who defined the site so profoundly we take his vision for granted perceptive deputy editor Nick Mead ebullient production editor Tash Reith-Banks (originator of the wonderful illustrated city series) the talented commissioning and community editor Claire Burke our indefatigable photo editor Jo Blason and our US editor-at-large Mark Oliver, an island of sanity. Particularly brilliant former desk editors have included Elle Hunt (I strongly recommend her terrific feature on Vienna), Francesca Perry, Marta Bausells, Athlyn Cathcart-Keays, Basia Cummings, Rory Lewarne, Naomi Larsson and Saptarshi Ray. We also couldn’t have done Cities without our colleagues on other  desks – chiefly Jamie Wilson, a hugely supportive international news editor who really helped us define how Cities could help further the ’s core editorial mission as well as our sharp-eyed head of photography, Fiona Shields Upside and Membership and all-round ideas man Mark Rice-Oxley editor of philanthropic projects Tracy McVeigh the giant  US and Australia editors John Mulholland and Lenore Taylor deputy editor Owen Gibson, who helped chaperone our segregated playgrounds campaign and  editor Katharine Viner for all the encouragement.A special shout-out must go to the ’s unparalleled Foundations team, led by powerhouse Rachel White her predecessor Ben Hicks, who masterminded the deal that created  Cities and Eleanor Clark, an absolute rock for us here in London. There are too many incredibly gifted writers to thank, but three stood out: Oliver Wainwright, the closest  Cities has come to speaking in a single voice Harriet Grant, whose tireless reporting led to our most tangible real-world impact, the banning of segregated playgrounds and Jon Watts, who didn’t just write the best piece  Cities has ever published, but was always generous with time, ideas, advice and support. Last but not least, a huge thank you to our multimedia executive producer Jess Gormley, an honorary Cities member if ever there was one and who, along with the gifted young producer Anetta Jones and soon-to-be-too-famous-for-us-to-hire director Max Duncan, created the outstanding Divided Cities, which stands proudly as our final, and best, documentary series.Above all, however, the site was made by you – and I don’t mean that figuratively. Your comments, opinions, suggestions and criticisms helped inform and shape our coverage.

Has her treatment in Britain been marked by racism? Oh no it hasn’t! Oh yes it has! The cast assume their positions. On one side of the stage, black and brown people are summoned to perform their parts in the pantomime – with frustration, disbelief, even tears. In the middle are the mediators, the TV and radio programme hosts – earnest, but clinically, unrelentingly goading. On the other side of the stage, the professional race-baiters, the red-tops, the “journalists”, the online trolls elevated to respectability once again, and Piers Morgan. There is always Piers Morgan.Britain’s conversation about race endlessly repeats itself, first as tragedy, and for ever thereafter as farce. Instead of discussing race relations in this country through the issues of hate crime, systemic police prejudice and the dramatic disparity of opportunity between people of different ethnic backgrounds, we have decided to debate it by constantly arguing about whether it is relevant. Because things are so much better than they used to be, aren’t they?In many ways, any improvement in race relations has come with a proportional decline in self-awareness, and with it a degradation of the public conversation on race. The increased visibility of black and brown people in those spaces where this conversation takes place – in politics and the media – has achieved little apart from sifting them into for and against camps. Whenever a public figure is subjected to racist behaviour, a sort of kangaroo court is set up, one with an impossibly high bar for proving a racist event has occurred – anything short of an explicit slur or a violent attack can easily be explained away. The outcome of the litigation is certain because the whole point of the exercise is the spectacle, rather than the inquiry. It’s a set-up.The subjects of the spectacle are not chosen by accident. As a nation, we love a celebrity racism row, and the media is happy to play both sides: everyone loves to read about celebrities, and it’s easy work to tear down someone young, famous and wealthy for claiming to be a victim of racism. In fact, it is this cherrypicking of the most prominent figures that guarantees that the national conversation about race is erted into one about privilege.The chosen protagonists – the princess, the pop star, the TV presenter, the politician – ensure that the conversation is never really about racism. Confining our attention to elite victims conveniently shrinks the subject to something neat and quick: it can be packaged into a short viral video, a highly quotable column that is basically an extended tweet, a studio shouting match that will light up social media.There will be no time to discuss the laziness, complicity and complacency of a media class that has turned racism into a spectator sport. There will be no time to discuss the unique toxicity of tabloid culture, and why it thrives in the UK. There will be no time to discuss the large swathes of a deeply conservative country that are goaded and taunted by a cultural showreel from the metropolis that inflames and excludes them.There will be no time to talk about the rightwards creep of our political culture under successive Tory governments that have consistently turned up the dial on nativism. There will be no time to position these elite victims as central characters in a culture war led by the right – one that has weaponised the word “woke” to discredit any efforts, or even gestures, towards social justice. There will be no time for anything but performance.And in the performance, behind a mask of innocent inquiry, the same old interrogation – which pretends to ask about racism in Britain, but in fact only hopes to smoke you out in the open and then draw some blood. Look out. It’s behind you.• Nesrine Malik is a  columnist.

To those of us who are too young to have lived through it, our awareness of it was less keen: a collection of vaguely remembered names, an iconic photograph of a naked young woman straddling a knock-off Arne Jacobsen chair, a swimming pool and a stately home, something about Russia.As in the case of Monica Lewinsky, the scandal became reified in aspic, boiled down to a collection of symbols (a dress, the Oval Office, “that woman”). And as with Lewinsky, the centrifugal force in the whole mess was deemed to be an attractive young woman. A young woman who bore the brunt of the guilt and the shame, and whose subjectivity remained for many years notably absent, despite her attempts to tell her side of the story. Fourth-wave feminism and a post-#MeToo climate have undoubtedly opened up the space needed for a reappraisal. The Trial of Christine Keeler is written, produced and directed by women, and offers us the perspectives of the women involved at the time, who, it is plain to see, were categorically not pulling the strings.“The accepted narrative was that Christine was a call girl, a prostitute, a siren, a femme fatale,” the director, Andrea Harkin, told the Observer. “Yet the reality is that she was none of those things. Nor was she a helpless victim. She was complex and vulnerable and tough and damaged and brilliant.”Men never left Keeler alone. She was raped, harassed, stalked, manipulated, mocked and vilified, all by men. What’s most affecting about the series so far is the cumulative effect of this on a young woman from a deprived background who, as well as being ambitious and willing to sell her story to the tabloids for a quick buck, is horribly out of her depth, claustrophobically surrounded by powerful men and their bullish desires.For women of my generation and younger, the slut-shaming of Keeler, as with that of Lewinsky, should belong in a bygone era, and can be interpreted as part of a prevailing culture of victim-blaming that is underpinned by misogyny. Keeler’s vilification was also, the BBC drama makes clear, underpinned by racism (she had black lovers as well as white ones) and classism. As in Mad Men, the ways in which women are pestered, objectified and patronised are played straight, as par for the course, rendering them even more shocking for those of us who did not live through those times.There’s a phrase that I’ve heard older women use in discussions of the sexism they faced in their lives, during the course of the conversations between the generations that have often come about as a result of the Me Too movement. The phrase is: “That’s just the way it was.” It is not, as it is sometimes misinterpreted, a statement of resigned defeat, complacency, or even one of complicity. It is more an acceptance of the fact that a sexist culture was so prevalent, so deeply embedded, so stifling, that to challenge each and every incidence of harassment would be impossible, exhausting and fruitless. So many women just tried to get on with it, or even exploited it to their advantage. That suffocating atmosphere is alien to a woman of my age, though we have all choked on the vapours following in its wake.That’s not to say that the shaming of Keeler was sanctioned by her female contemporaries. The artist Pauline Boty’s missing painting of Keeler, entitled Scandal ’63, has become better known in recent years from its inclusion in Ali Smith’s 2016 novel Autumn. No one knows where it is, but it exists in photographs: look at the heads of the four men hovering above the naked Keeler Boty, also a young woman who was prized mainly for her looks, knew the score. Almost 60 years later, Dear Christine, an exhibition of work by female artists, builds on Boty’s attempt to reframe Keeler’s role. This, combined with the dramatisation, finally does Keeler some justice.It has been intensely moving to see Keeler offered the redemption that was granted much more prematurely to the men involved with her, and to see her given a fully rounded character rather than being reduced to the cardboard cutout of a tart (an actual headline at the time: “Keeler, The Shameless Slut”) who ruined a powerful man’s career, and, latterly, ageing paparazzi fodder for cruel tabloid media. Perhaps the reappraisal of Keeler is all the more moving for the reappraisals we have all been undertaking after #MeToo. I felt so terribly grownup as a very young woman, and sometimes acted as though I was. But the older men I was involved with? They knew that I wasn’t. I only really understand that now.That’s the power of female subjectivity. So often we are encouraged to imagine ourselves in the shoes of male protagonists, but how often are audiences encouraged to imagine themselves in the body of a 17-year-old girl self-administering an abortion using a pen because there is no legal way of terminating her pregnancy? A 17-year-old girl who somehow carried on and ended up shortly afterwards a cipher for the so-called liberation of an entire society, because she slept with a man who had power. These revisionist excavations of the past are timely and necessary. It’s an old, old story, but that doesn’t mean we have to keep telling it in the same way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1de7a71520933ab22fead7778a6180fc2bf25d5/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=041f1bffa8b105d84925dbe19b7a4176","title":"sanders iowa leading democrats panic","story":"Far from being an outsider with unrealistic ideas, his record shows Sanders to be a pragmatist who knows how to winSurprise has turned into panic. With Bernie Sanders leading in early battleground states and competitive with former vice-president Joe Biden nationally, the Democratic establishment is sounding the alarm. “Should Sanders actually pull off the feat of capturing the nomination, Donald Trump would have been given a gift that almost assures his re-election,” says the Daily Beast. Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, has a similar message: “If I were a campaign manager for Donald Trump and I look at the field, I would very much want to run against Bernie Sanders.”The economy is doing well, and if Republicans get to run a “business” candidate in Trump against a socialist ideologue in Sanders, Messina figures, they’ll win. Obama himself has promised to intervene, if necessary, to stop Sanders.If you’re a part of the Democratic party’s power structures, the same structures that failed to thwart Republican takeover of local and state governments and Trump’s election, then perhaps you have reason for concern. Sanders is running a different campaign – in rhetoric, ideology and base – than other primary candidates. And he’s clearly a threat to the Democratic party status quo – its large donors and its nomenklatura would be on the outs in a Sanders administration.But if you’re an ordinary Democratic voter, or just someone worried about the possibility of a second Trump term, there’s no need for panic. Sanders is a candidate with both a long record of electoral success and real progressive accomplishments in both executive and legislative office. He may still be something of an outsider in Washington, owing to his style and political background, but he’s far less of a radical than either his most ardent supporters or implacable foes care to admit.Sanders represents a new political mainstream in the United States, more egalitarian in outlook than liberalism but less likely to turn off the non-partisan, irregular voters who will need to be won over in November.The case against Sanders’s electability centers on two things: his age and his ideology. At 78, he is the oldest candidate in the field. But despite his October heart attack, Sanders appears to be in good health – energetic at rallies and quick-witted during debates. It helps, no doubt, that his major competitor in the primary, Biden, just turned 77 and Donald Trump will be 74 this year.Unable to play up age, for fear of disqualifying Biden as well, most of the attention has turned to Sanders’s embrace of democratic socialism. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, captured the conventional wisdom last April when he said, “Let’s not be so New York and so coastal right? I think it’s very hard to get elected president as a socialist in this country, when you look at the states we have to win.”This overstates how important “democratic socialism” is as an ideological label to most Americans. To the extent that it’s defined by its mainstream protagonists, such as Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, democratic socialism can be summed up in commonsense terms of fairness and shared responsibility, and associated with Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal (though this too is a relatively obscure point of reference).What Sanders’s detractors don’t understand is that even though it’s to the left of contemporary liberalism, his redistributive politics has more appeal with self-described moderate voters than typical Democrat ones.As Jared Abbott and Dustin Guastella point out, millions of Americans are working class, don’t identify with either party, and barely turn out to vote, despite holding more egalitarian views on key issues than your average Democratic primary voters.These potential voters, like most of the country as a whole, support demands such as Medicare for All, federal job programs, trade unions, free higher education and student debt cancellation. Bridging the gap between the one in four Americans who identify as “liberal” and the two-thirds of Americans who support tax hikes on the rich is crucial to building a majoritarian leftwing politics.Sanders’s strength lies in his popularity, both among and outside the Democratic base, and his ability to tie together progressive economic and social demands into a narrative that valorizes working people, vilifies a political and corporate elite, and sidesteps partisan “culture war” in favor of populist class war.He’s an outsider, but one who picks his battles wisely and knows how to frame a debate. Take, for instance, his stance on gun control. Sanders has a “D” rating from the National Rifle Association, and he’s worn that as a badge of honor, railing against the organization and its role in national politics. He’s done this despite representing a state with high rates of gun ownership.Sanders needs the votes of Vermont hunters. But luckily, they see him as a foe of lobbyists and a friend of theirs, and not an anti-second amendment zealot. They keep electing him, despite his support for gun control. This, in a nutshell, is how we win in a polarized country. We don’t fight a liberal culture war, but rather we change the terms of the conflict so that we can win the broadest base possible and marginalize the powerful interests that dominate politics and the economy.Of course, we can only go so far with anecdotes. A relatively unknown figure, playing catch-up in closed Democratic primaries, Sanders fell short in 2016 and wasn’t able to prove his electability against Trump then. However, his overall electoral record is a strong one. As Matthew Yglesias acknowledges, Sanders’s statewide results compare favorably to those of Democratic presidential nominees in Vermont:Sanders is personally popular, he’s campaigning on a popular set of issues, and he’s figured out a popular way to tie those issues together. Sanders has managed to take a sprawling program and make it seem cohesive, and not like a laundry list of progressive concerns. And his record speaks for itself, he’s a seasoned campaigner who knows how to win elections.The strongest case against Sanders has nothing to do with his electability or his democratic socialist identification, but rather with the disconnect between his political demands and a gridlocked political environment.Of course, this concern has nothing to do with his chances against Trump. A lot of good would be accomplished simply by removing the president and his party from the Oval Office. Not only would rightwing judicial and agency appointments be replaced by progressive ones, but Sanders would be able to pursue action on a host of issues – from climate change to criminal justice – through executive orders. He’d also be able to chart a new course for American foreign policy, keeping us out of unpopular wars and whittling down our sprawling imperial presence.But legislative failure and administrative incompetence in Washington would hurt Democratic re-election chances in 2024 and candidates at every level. It’s here that Sanders’s record as a public servant is instructive.When Sanders first came to prominence in Vermont, the state was relatively conservative. Burlington, in particular, was dominated by a few major families and a bipartisan political machine. Failed policies and constrained city finances led Sanders’s predecessor as mayor, Gordon Paquette, to push austerity, cutting public services and the salaries of municipal employees.After his surprise mayoral election, Sanders found himself stymied by his city council and powerful business interests. He moved forward by rallying activists, forging new coalitions and slowly expanding his base by improving the delivery of public services and communicating honestly with his constituencies.Yglesias, of Vox, has described Sanders’s time in both Burlington and Washington as periods of savvy organizing, pragmatism and success. But it’s worth emphasizing that Sanders did not engage in compromise for the sake of compromise. He pursued alliances to serve his base and his actions managed not just to deliver material gains, but to help reshape politics in Vermont.In Washington, Sanders’s coalition-building meant teaming up with liberal representatives (and occasionally cutting deals with conservatives) and voting for imperfect legislation, but at the same time using his platform to evangelize for his longer-term vision. Sanders wouldn’t have maintained his reputation as a principled outsider if his effectiveness wasn’t married to this ideological stubbornness.In 2009, when Obama met one of his leftwing supporters, the Nation publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, he reminded her that “the perfect is the enemy of the good”. With a commanding electoral mandate, the president must have felt confident that he had a formula for success. But under his watch, the Democrats lost 13 governorships and a whopping 816 state legislative seats.The same figures who steered the party under Obama also assured us that Hillary Clinton was closer to the “median voter” and thus more electable than either Sanders or Trump.Maybe it’s time we stopped pretending that Messina and Obama know how best to win elections in the United States.Sanders is an anti-establishment figure, and one with a decades-long history on the left, but his policy commitments are not outside the new American mainstream. If he can galvanize the same “moderate” irregular voters who have been drawn to him in the past, he won’t just beat Trump, he’ll set the stage for a long-term political realignment – the political revolution he calls for.Sanders is a rebel, but he’s one who people know and trust. In other words, he’s the perfect candidate for 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66c92a18357a0a986470f17903e790b837bbca45/0_75_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=238f99a4b57fa8596d8d3eed18f6d396","title":"tories new voters conundrum tough policy polling","story":"It is now a month since the Conservatives romped to victory in the general election. Though the picture was complex, there was one movement of voters that was larger than many had anticipated. This was the levels of direct switching from Labour to the Conservatives by working-class voters across northern England and the Midlands.“Labour leavers”, “traditional Labour voters” – we’ve heard many names for this group. But the most accurate description of their circumstances is one coined in the summer of 2016 by Theresa May. For these voters are the “just about managing”, those who “work around the clock”, for whom “sometimes life can be a struggle”. They feel a financial squeeze but are above the threshold to be eligible for social benefits.Polling conducted by my company, JL Partners, immediately after the election showed that most defectors to the Conservatives were in this “C1C2” group, in “unskilled” white-collar or “skilled” blue-collar jobs: they are the receptionists, the plumbers, the forklift drivers of Britain. And they are now key to the Conservatives’ continued electoral success.“Get Brexit done” and the toxicity of Jeremy Corbyn helped win them over in December. There were elements of domestic policy aimed at these voters in the Conservative manifesto, with higher spending on public services, and a cut to national insurance. But the Conservatives will need a more positive and longer-lasting domestic agenda, aimed fully at their concerns, to keep them on board.But there is a challenge in catering so strongly to this group, which strikes at a tension at the heart of modern Conservatism. Helping them does not equate to helping the most vulnerable in society. This is because these new Tory voters are not the poorest – far from it. That same polling reveals that the average household income of voters who moved to the Conservatives is £29,000. They are voters who have one car belonging to their household rather than none at all. Two-thirds of them have been on a foreign holiday in the last three years. They feel they struggle with money, but the pressures mean cutting back on extras rather than not putting food on the table.Successfully navigating the sometimes conflicting demands of these two groups – the just about managing and the most vulnerable – is the conundrum now for the Conservative party. When David Cameron set out his vision for his government weeks before the referendum result that resulted in his departure from office, he put his focus squarely on the latter group. He said his government’s mission was to “rescue a generation from poverty and extend life chances”. It may sound similar in tone to May’s opening speech, but the two prime ministers are talking about distinctly different groups, with significant ramifications in terms of policy and government activity.Policies aimed at one can upset the other. An example is the national living wage. Surely this is universally popular? Focus groups that I ran during my time at No 10 showed that many in the just about managing group felt it was unfair. They had worked for years and years without a pay rise, albeit on a higher wage, but spoke of seeing brand new staff entering and immediately getting a significant pay increase due to the new rules. The same went for changes to the personal allowance: though popular with working-class strugglers when framed as a tax cut for them, many saw it as a change aimed at someone else. This highlights the difficulties of juggling these two groups – go too far one way and the Conservatives risk marginalising their new voters, go too far another, and they risk looking like the “nasty party” all over again.This trade-off is not a zero-sum game. But policy, and the communication of it, is a world of prioritisation, and the instinct to gear policy towards the most vulnerable is very strong across the civil service. Some of this is down to policy reality, some of it orthodoxy, some of it political pressure. In 2017, May’s government tried to create a new category of “working-class families” in the Department for Education’s measurements of school performance, in addition to those children on free school meals. The pushback was intense, at both political and official levels, and after the general election the changes ended up being abandoned. If No 10 wants to turn more attention towards working-class voters, it will need a relentless focus to overturn these default instincts.The central power of No 10 and the force of Johnson’s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, may mean there is an opportunity to do so. Ministers who instinctively “get” the importance of these voters are important – the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, and Home Office minister Brandon Lewis jump out as examples. Though there may be changes in the machinery of government, the Treasury will be key, especially in the run-up to the next budget. Ultimately the chancellor will still hold many of the levers of policy, and if action to help working-class strugglers is going to dominate a budget, then the chancellor – who will be up against a resistant set of officials – will need to consistently champion such an agenda.The cost of living is an area where policy can make a difference, particularly in relation to energy, fuel (this group overwhelmingly drive rather than get public transport), and food (the increasing expensiveness of “the weekly shop” hangs over them). Better funded and more responsive public services with less bureaucracy are important. There are policy areas that can address both the just about managing and the most vulnerable too, such as tackling rough sleeping and homelessness – a concern for all voters who have seen it increase dramatically over the last few years.It is a tightrope, and it belies a quiet tension in Conservative ideology over the last decade: between Cameron’s “life chances” and May’s “just about managing”. What Boris Johnson does will determine whether his electoral coalition is a fleeting one to deliver Brexit, or whether he remakes Conservatism for good.• James Johnson is a political adviser and former Downing Street pollster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d27ae32668c426dd911b376845b13ce465ccc9cd/0_301_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7949c61cadb8936642f78f0417df2288","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of peace","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘peace’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘peace’.Share your photos of what peace means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 15 January at 10am.

It is increasingly common sense on UK campuses that these companies can play no productive role in solving the climate crisis.”Saltmarsh warned that those institutions that held out against estment would be harshly judged by history.“Universities not yet ested can now choose to stand with their students on the right side of history or be forever known as complicit in the crimes of climate breakdown.”In the past year a flurry of major academic institutions – from University College London to York University – have pledged to est completely. However several major universities, including Cambridge, are still subject to vociferous campaigns by students and staff over their links to the fossil fuel industry.A  investigation last year revealed that just 20 fossil fuel giants are linked to a third of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis.And as awareness of the industry’s role in the climate crisis has grown, it has come under growing pressure in the UK with leading arts institutions facing calls to end their sponsorship deals and protesters targeting inidual companies.Saltmarsh said: “Wildfires are wreaking destruction across Australia, the Amazon and beyond while fossil fuel companies profit from the extraction to blame for this devastation. Excluding this industry from our universities is now a mainstream and majority position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c468cff654c4d43c7e478960ad6a3e12f731743/59_0_1803_1082/master/1803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b08e46a0f54fc8a5b0a8e5cfe25dba2","title":"like a bomb going off why brazils largest reserve is facing destruction aoe","story":"Gold prospectors are ravaging the Yanomami indigenous reserve. So why does President Bolsonaro want to make them legal?Deep in the Yanomami indigenous reserve on the northern reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, the ruins of an illegal goldminers’ camp emerge after an hour in a small plane and two in a boat. No roads reach here.Wooden frames alongside the Uraricoera River that once supported shops, bars, restaurants, a pharmacy, an evangelical church and even brothels are all that is left of the small town. The army burned and trashed it as part of an operation aimed at stamping out wildcat mining on the reserve. The army may have taken away the town, but they left the garimpeiros, as the miners are called, who this morning are hunched around a freezer, waiting for the soldiers camped downriver to leave so they can get back to work. Up to 20,000 garimpeiros are estimated by Brazilian NGO Instituto Socioambiental to have invaded this reserve, where mining and unauthorised outsiders are currently prohibited. But the garimpeiros may not remain unauthorised for long: the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to legalise their work with a bill in Congress.“I know it is illegal,” says Bernardo Gomes, 59, sitting by the frame of a bar. Formerly a worker at mining giant Vale, Gomes says his time at the company taught him how to protect the environment. “Today, unfortunately, I am helping to destroy it,” he says, explaining that a nearby patch of dead trees was suffocated by mud sucked out of the nearby mining pit.Some of his companions decline to talk, including a young woman who arrives carrying a bottle of whiskey and a speaker playing pop music. “Want a photo? Naked?” she jokes.In eight days reporting from different locations in the Yanomami reserve, the  saw numerous mining pits and barges. Camps and bases had been destroyed along the Uraricoera – but its banks still teemed with outsiders.With 9.6m hectares (23.7m acres) of wild forest – an area bigger than Portugal – Yanomami is Brazil’s largest reserve. A fifth of its indigenous population died from diseases after 40,000 garimpeiros flooded the reserve in the 1980s, according to Survival International. The miners were expelled and the area declared a reserve in 1992 following a campaign by Survival, photographer Claudia Andujar and Davi Kopenawa, director of the Hutukara Yanomami Association, which invited the  to visit the reserve.But the current garimpeiro invasion worsened after Bolsonaro took office. The president has said the reserve is too big for its population of around 26,000 indigenous people, and its mineral riches should be exploited. His ministers have met garimpo leaders.But garimpeiros bring malaria, prostitution and violence, indigenous leaders argue, while scientists say the mercury the miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt enters rivers and the food chain. Their pits and barges upset ecosystems, scare away wildlife, and fill rivers with mud that distorts fish behaviour and breeding.Indigenous people used to call this upriver region Paixão de Mutum – or Curassow’s Passion – after the large, pheasant-like bird they hunted here. Now it is known as Tatuzão – Big Armadillo – for the pits that miners have gouged out of the forest. Miners have replaced the mutum.Funai, the national agency which works to protect indigenous lands, plans to reopen three bases in the reserve. But repeated army operations have failed to shift the miners.Just a few minutes upriver from the ruined camp, work has already resumed in an enormous mining pit, where tarpaulin and scaffolding made of logs and twine hold up a bank of earth. Three men toil waist-deep in mud with a hose jetting water under an uprooted tree. Mud pours down a rough wooden sluice, while black smoke belches from a deafening diesel engine: a hand-operated industrial hell amid the wild tropical beauty.“We are here to get gold. These are our riches,” says garimpeiro Fredson Pedrosa, 40. “Everyone here is counting on the army leaving so they can work again.”The men are from small towns in Brazil’s impoverished north and north-east, where they say minimum-salary wages of around US$250 a month (£194) are barely enough to live on. “You do this to keep your family,” says Denilson Nascimento, 33.Garimpeiros say they voted for Bolsonaro after he promised to legalise their trade. “We know it damages the environment,” says Antonio Almeida, 24, who runs a bar here. “But there is a lot of nature, no way you can kill it all.”Wildcat mining is deeply entwined with local life in Waikás. Four villagers work as boatmen for the miners, others sell food at Tatuzão and two run a smaller mining site nearby. Tolls on the garimpo boats paid for generators, boat motors and televisions.“The garimpo is a reality and they’re used to it,” says Edmilson Estevão, 33, who was raised in the village and works for the Ye’kwana association Wanasseduume. Some villagers work with the mining, others reject it, but the Ye’kwana keep their differences to themselves. “Same family, same blood,” he says.The garimpo has impacted heavily on hunting, fishing and water quality. “The prey is getting further and further away. Fish are disappearing, and are contaminated with mercury,” says Júlio Ye’kwana, 39, Wanasseduume’s president. “Wild pigs used to live around the village. Not anymore.”When mining in the Tatuzão area was operating at full pelt, the river where children bathe and families collect water thickened with mud. “The water was very dirty,” says Nivaldo Edamya, 34, the village chief. “What garimpo does is bad. Deforestation, various diseases, that’s why I am against them.”Academic research on the impacts of garimpo – or Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) – on bioersity backs up these complaints.Marcelo Oliveira, a conservation specialist at the World Wildlife Fund has found high mercury levels in fish as far as 150km from ASGM sites in the Amazon. He and other researchers found mercury in Amazon river dolphins – nearly half of those studied had dangerously high levels – and other researchers found record mercury levels in jaguar fur near ASGM sites in the Brazilian Pantanal. “This is an invisible problem,” he says.Birds and larger mammals are sensitive to changes in forest cover and vegetation and flee garimpo areas, says David Lutz, a US-based research assistant professor in environmental studies at Dartmouth College who has studied ASGM in the Peruvian Amazon for a decade. “Massive disturbance. This is like a bomb going off. This is as drastic as you’ll see,” he says, after viewing photos of Tatuzão.A study carried out by Lutz and colleagues in Peru found water quality was severely impacted near ASGM sites. Mud and silt thickened rivers, reducing visibility, which would disturb seasonal behaviour and even the breeding habits of fish and the life cycles of insects. “There is a handful of species that can handle this change, so those species become dominant and it lowers the numbers of other species,” says Lutz.Near Waikás, two rough-hewn wooden barges used to dredge for gold are hidden in a tributary. Banks of sand, stones and mud sucked up by the barges had formed in the river. “They are reshaping the river structure,” says Lutz. “This will really change the sediment.”In the 1980s and 1990s, William Milliken, an ethnobotanist at Kew Gardens documented the impacts in Yanomami areas degraded by ASGM, such as disappearing caiman and a reduction in plants such as fish poison vine. “It’s likely to happen again,” he said.The mercury that miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt is dumped into rivers and burned off into the air, says Luis Fernandez, a tropical ecologist and director at the Wake Forest University centre for Amazon Scientific Innovation in the US.Mercury spreads into the aquatic ecosystem via a process called biomagnification and concentrates rapidly as it passes up the food chain. “The food chain acts like a signal amplifier,” he says. “Environmental chemistry in the tropics is much faster than in temperate regions.”An hour’s flight across the rolling hills of jungle from Waikás – passing over a garimpo pit and camp with its own vegetable garden – brings you to the health post at Maloca Paapiú. The Yanomami people it serves live in communal houses of extended families deep in thick forest, reached by muddy, winding trails. Here, men and women use black and red face and body paint and women wear short skirts of fronds, bamboo spears in their noses and cheeks barefoot children skip nimbly across the slippery logs that serve as bridges across numerous streams and rivers.Garimpeiros overran the region in the late 1980s. Now they are inching closer again. Noemia Yanomama, 40, says she saw a garimpo camp near the hills where she hunts. She worries young indigenous men will bring sexual diseases from prostitutes in the camps. “Soon they will get close to the community. That makes me very sad,” she says.Young men and teenage boys gather daily at the health post to charge cellphones they bought working on garimpo sites reached by hours of walking. One site abandoned this year was just a few hours away.This is creating a generational ide with their parents, who still hunt with bows and arrows. “The garimpo is not our friend. We call it a disease,” says Tibiana Yanomama, 42.His son Oziel, 15, escaped to the nearest garimpo with his friend Marcos, 21. Both spent three weeks working there, clearing jungle, before Tibiana went and dragged them back.“I wanted shoes, a machete, a sharpening file,” Marcos says. “I wanted a hammock. I wanted to work.” He was paid five grams of gold (worth around $180). He saw garimpeiros working with mercury and drank beer and sugar cane rum. “I got very drunk,” he says, with a nervous laugh.Tibiana is furious with Oziel. “The youth don’t listen,” he says. And he is livid with Bolsonaro’s plans to legalise garimpo. “What does he want for Brazil? This forest is Brazil,” he says. Oziel caught malaria, a recurrent problem in garimpo camps, where pools of waste water provide breeding grounds for mosquitos. The Maloca Paapiú health post handles 15 new cases a week.For the Yanomami, nature and spirituality are intrinsically linked: every rock, every waterfall, every bird, every monkey has a spirit, says Maneose Yanomama, 55, shaman of the Sikamabi-U community. And the spirits of nature are sounding the alarm. “The whites are getting closer. They are damaging our land, they are destroying our rivers, they are ruining our forests,” he said. “Nature is very scared.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb2435d607511ab9db581988603891bea293057/0_45_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f1a8e3d49d67e0b856cfc6b6c874347","title":"un draft plan sets 2030 target to avert earths sixth mass extinction aoe","story":"Paris-style proposal to counter loss of ecosystems and wildlife vital to the future of humanity will go before October summitAlmost a third of the world’s oceans and land should be protected by the end of the decade to stop and reverse bioersity decline that risks the survival of humanity, according to a draft Paris-style UN agreement on nature.To combat what scientists have described as the sixth mass extinction event in Earth’s history, the proposal sets a 2030 deadline for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and wildlife that perform crucial services for humans.The text, drafted by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, is expected to be adopted by governments in October at a crucial UN summit in the Chinese city of Kunming. It comes after countries largely failed to meet targets for the previous decade agreed in Aichi, Japan, in 2010.The draft text has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, who have called on governments to treat the targets outlined in the accord as the minimum acceptable level for which to aim.The director of Campaign for Nature, Brian O’Donnell, said: “Today’s draft shows that countries are listening and that they recognise the increasingly important role that protecting land and water must play in confronting climate change, preventing wildlife extinctions, and supporting people and local communities. This is a very encouraging first step.“Much work remains to be done in the coming months to ensure that the rights of indigenous people are advanced, and bold conservation and finance targets are included in the final agreement.”By 2030, the trade in wild species must be legal and sustainable, according to the draft document, which also aims to promote the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities in decision-making about bioersity.Bioersity\u0026nbspis the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. \u0026nbsp“Without bioersity, there is no future for humanity,” says Prof David Macdonald, at Oxford University. It is comprised of several levels, starting with genes, then inidual species, then communities of creatures and finally entire ecosystems, such as forests or coral reefs, where life interplays with the physical environment.\u0026nbspThe extinction rate of species is now thought to be about\u0026nbsp1,000 times higher\u0026nbspthan before humans dominated the planet, which may be even faster than the\u0026nbsplosses after a giant meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs\u0026nbsp65m years ago. The\u0026nbspsixth mass extinction in geological history has already begun, according to some scientists. Billions of inidual populations have been lost, with the number of animals living on Earth having\u0026nbspplunged by half since 1970. Researchers call the\u0026nbspmassive loss of wildlife\u0026nbspa “biological annihilation”.\u0026nbspForest felling is often the first step and 30m hectares – the area of the Britain and Ireland – were lost globally in 2016. Poaching and unsustainable hunting for food is another major factor. Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia – but once species become extinct, there’s no going back.The planned agreement forms part of a long-term international framework that aims to ensure bioersity is sustainably valued and conserved by 2050.“But this is the floor, not the ceiling. Now every government on Earth must get behind this bold mission and drive through a global agreement for nature this year.”In May, the world’s leading scientists warned that nature is being destroyed at a rate up to hundreds of times higher than the average for the previous 10 million years, due to human activity.The destruction of the planet’s coral reefs, rainforests and other vital ecosystems have placed human society in jeopardy, with the report’s authors warning of “ominous” consequences such as freshwater shortages and climate instability unless radical action is taken."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b24604a97deade0533d4b07e157c9c5da2776ad/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b898f64a73214e67b91d8944349f95d8","title":"oscars 2020 nominations joker irishman","story":"Less than a week since Bafta’s strikingly white and male awards shortlist met with widespread criticism – including from the organisation’s own chief executive – the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences has released a set of nominations whose small concessions to ersity seem striking by contrast.Cynthia Erivo is nominated for best actress for her role in slave drama Harriet, and Parasite – Boon Jong Ho’s acclaimed South Korean black comedy – is up for six awards, including best director and best picture.Little Women, Greta Gerwig’s so-far overlooked take on the Louisa May Alcott classic, also scored six nominations, including best picture and best adapted screenplay – but Gerwig was locked out of the all-male best director shortlist.Such moves are likely to be sufficient to insulate the Academy from the anger which greeted Bafta’s equivalent announcement last Tuesday, where its members snubbed all non-white acting nominees, as well as homegrown talent such as Rapman and Joanna Hogg, and credited Joker – Todd Phillips’s Batman origins story – with the most nods.Joker is also the nominee to beat at the Oscars this year, where it likewise goes into the race with 11 nominations, including best picture, best director and best actor for Joaquin Phoenix.It is only the second comic book movie to land a picture nomination, following Black Panther in 2018. Nine years before, Christopher Nolan’s Gotham-set The Dark Knight was snubbed for best picture – a move which many felt damagingly highlighted the ergent tastes of Oscar voters and paying audiences.Coming in with 10 nominations are Sam Mendes’s first world war thriller 1917, Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to 1960’s LA, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Martin Scorsese’s wintry mob epic, The Irishman.Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach’s orce drama, ended up with six nominations, including for stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson. Johannson’s role in Jojo Rabbit means she will also be in the running in the best supporting actress race this year – although Laura Dern’s turn as her cynical lawyer in Marriage Story makes her the favourite.Little Women’s Florence Pugh, Richard Jewell’s Kathy Bates and Margot Robbie (for Bombshell, costing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood a key nod) round out the category – leaving Jennifer Lopez unrecognised for her pole-dancing turn in Hustlers.Meanwhile The Irishman’s Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, whose part in Tarantino’s film has earned him some career-best notices, compete for supporting actor.Phoenix is the man to beat for leading actor, having taken the lion’s share of awards so far for his transformative performance in Joker. He is up against Driver, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonathan Pryce (for The Two Popes) and Pain and Glory’s Antonio Banderas.Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler failed to capitalise on prodigious buzz for Dolemite is My Name and Uncut Gems, respectively – and Robert De Niro’s leading role in The Irishman again failed to win over first round voters. Taron Egerton’s Golden Globe win on Sunday for his Elton John in Rocketman did not in the end convert to an Oscar nomination.Another apparent lock-in leads the best actress nominations: Renée Zellweger, whose turn as Judy Garland in last year’s biopic has won over critics and voters in other awards bodies alike. Competing against she, Johansson and Erivo are Little Women’s Saoirse Ronan and Bombshell’s Charlize Theron. Lupita Nyong’o did not make the final cut for her double role in Jordan Peele’s horror movie, Us neither did The Farewell’s Awkwafina –\u0026nbspthe complete exclusion of Nina Wang’s much-admired female-centric Chinese-American drama does not help the Academy’s inclusivity cause.Last year’s Oscars won much praise for handing out four trophies – including best director – to Alfonso Cuaron’s Spanish-language, black-and-white story of a domestic servant, Roma praise tempered by the eventual victory of reductive interracial road movie Green Book for best picture. This year, second round voters have the chance to repeat the trick by honouring a foreign language film in categories other than best international film: Parasite – which tells of an impoverished family infiltrating the lives of a wealthy household – is also up for best film, best director, best original screenplay, best editing and best production design.The backlash to the Baftas last week led to such a backlash that the awards body promised a major review of its voting procedures. Speaking to the , Steve McQueen – a Bafta and Oscar winner for 12 Years a Slave – said the organisation risked cultural redundancy without urgent change.Both the Baftas and Oscars have undertaken membership shakeups over the past five years in a bid to better reflect the ersity of both films and the wider world.In 2016 the Oscars announced an intention to double their number of female and minority voters by 2020 a goal which appears to have been achieved by enormous drafts of fresh members, including 842 new faces in 2019 – and, more controversially, taking voting privileges away from “dormant” members.• More to follow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61da6012bf706eea8caad2d82ec5bb8d449a0cbd/0_1187_8019_4813/master/8019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=780c3f6c2b7e7ab767ea609b23315e98","title":"fried potatoes eggs recipe rachel roddy comfort food","story":"Breakfast or brunch couldn’t be simpler – just islands of fried eggs in a pan of cubed potatoes with perfectly crisped edgesAfter his citrus cookery demonstration, the Sicilian chef Corrado Assenza asked us, a room of about 20 people, if there were any questions. I put my hand up into the lemony air. A young man near me did not: he simply shot out his question like a bullet, and it was the same question as mine. Corrado noticed, but I turned my keen arm into a “it’s fine” wave, so he answered the man, ending with thanks for a good question, before turning back to me. Acknowledging that my question had been answered would have been the sensible thing to do, but petty rage isn’t sensible. Being sensible also felt like giving the upper hand to the usurper, so I grabbed a thought: “What is your comfort food?” translating it as it came out of my mouth (cos’e il tuo comfort cibo?).Not only did the question feel wrong and twee, it was also a bad translation that didn’t make any sense. Even if I had got it right (qual è il tuo cibo di conforto?), it doesn’t have quite the same meaning. The situation was further confused when someone else asked if I meant comfort in terms of comodità, as in “convenient” or “easy”. Fortunately, Corrado understood what I was getting at it depended on when I asked him, he said: “Different moments called for completely different sorts of comfort.” He also suggested that maybe the reason there is no need for the term comfort food in Italian is because the words are one and the same: food is comfort.Maybe it’s because there was a time when it wasn’t. I think of Corrado and the idea that “food is comfort” often. Mostly with the predictable things: mashed or baked potatoes pasta with sauce and cheese baked fruit tomatoes on bread a moon of watermelon eaten in the sea the cricket ball-sized arancine filled with ragu bechamel and peas we buy from the bar near the port of Palermo, all of them a little homecoming.But more than the predictable are the other things: the apple I always eat on the way to pick up my son from school the Polo mint I suck before any sort of interview the hard-boiled egg I buy from M\u0026ampS when I arrive at Gatwick, which often gives me heartburn, discomfort-comfort. Writing about the mysterious appetites of grief in her essay S is for Sad (in An Alphabet for Gourmets), the American food writer MFK Fisher notes: “It is as if our bodies, wiser than we who wear them, call out for encouragement and strength … to eat.” I am not comparing an interview to grief, but in that moment, the little Polo clinking beneath my teeth like a mint ceramic is encouragement and strength. It is also familiar.Food is comfort for me when it is dependable when I know what is coming: the apple, the egg, doughnuts for breakfast on a Saturday, and fried potatoes and eggs on a Monday. Today’s dish isn’t really a recipe rather, it is a way with a kilo of potatoes and four eggs, and one of my favourite things to eat with anyone, but especially just the three of us at this time of year.I must end by noting that I have debated quite seriously with my partner Vincenzo for 11 years about cooking the potatoes, before admitting his way – uncovered, covered and then uncovered – is best, giving our comfort crisp edges.Olive oil1.2kg potatoes, peeled and cut into roughly 1cm cubes (you don’t need to be too precise)SaltLeaves from 1 rosemary stalk4 large eggsPour some olive oil into a frying pan – seven tablespoons as a guide – then tip in the potatoes along with a good pinch of salt, and put over a medium flame.Cook for about three minutes, tossing the cubes around until they are coated with oil, then reduce the flame to low and cover with a lid. Leave the potatoes to cook gently, shaking the pan a couple of times, for 15 minutes, in which time they will steam, braise and almost cook through.Uncover, add the rosemary and raise the heat. As the potatoes are almost cooked, this stage is all about crisping, so fry for 10 minutes, stirring often to brown all sides.Push the potatoes aside to create four small hollows, break the eggs into the hollows and fry until done. Serve immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c1cec5095f67034f24720ab57445225987be84b/0_1081_5683_3409/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d871f43441825c7d52fdc709d3bee01","title":"macaroni cheese with kale and crisp breadcrumbs recipe thomasina miers","story":"You’ll never go back to ordinary macaroni cheese after making this version, oozing with a deeply cheesy flavour and crowned with a crisp crustI never really understood the appeal of macaroni cheese, a stodgy dish tasting of pasta and not much else, until I went to a neighbour’s fireworks display last year.

Pep Guardiola is open to Agüero reconsidering though the manager is clear it will be the player’s decision.“After this, I want to keep going and keep scoring more goals, but the most important for me is that the team keeps winning and winning,” he said. “I don’t know what will happen from now until the end of the season, but it’s a moment to enjoy.“I’m very happy to be breaking records. It’s always nice to receive awards. I want to thank my teammates for helping me to score them in all these years. Also, I’m aware it’s not easy to score 12 hat-tricks in the Premier League, as it is such a difficult competition. I’m very proud and very happy for it.As City have another 54 league matches before he is expected to depart it seems likely Agüero will score the 23 needed to become only the third player to register 200 goals in the Premier League. That would take him past Andy Cole, whose 187 strikes places him third in the chart.While Agüero has a chance of beating Wayne Rooney’s 207, the 31-year-old would have to extend his contract at City to have any chance of beating Shearer’s record return of 260.His teammate Riyad Mahrez said: “It’s unbelievable to have him in the team.

They just seem to win all their battles, inidually and collectively, and are a level above most of the teams they encounter. The quality and consistency of their play is phenomenal. If you were to paint an abstract picture to illustrate this Arsenal side it would be colourful, it would have energy and there would be light and shade. I love the way their game can be about finding gaps in tight spaces, but sometimes Leah Williamson at centre-half plays a 60-yard diagonal long ball into Vivianne Miedema. You see a real freedom from Joe Montemurro’s players, an ability to express themselves, and it’s a real joy to watch. If you think you can stop them by congesting things in that final third when they have the ball, you can still get caught with a long ball. Lisa Evans, their right-back, has been outstanding, creating and joining attacks. With the title fight still close they know that goal difference could be vital, and this was more evidence of their ruthless streak, always pushing for more. You would expect them to beat Brighton, the only surprise was that Miedema wasn’t on the scoresheet.Manchester City beat Everton 3-1 in the first game since the announcement that their manager, Nick Cushing, is to leave to take over at New York City FC in MLS. City are just three points and a goal difference of four behind the league leaders, Arsenal, but it is important to reflect on what Cushing’s departure means in a number of ways. Obviously he is looking for progression after more than six years in charge, but it is also a reflection on a club that does not seem to have the ambition that they used to. Unlike Arsenal, Chelsea and even Manchester United, they aren’t extending their budget to sign the world’s best players. In fact I would say they are overachieving in the league, and that the underlying feeling is that they have stagnated a little bit. They still had too much quality for Everton, who were without their new signing, Izzy Christiansen. The fact that City could bring Tessa Wullaert, a Belgian international with over 80 caps, and Ellen White, the top scorer at the World Cup, off the bench demonstrated the depth they still have. Pauline Bremer, who played at right-back for her last club, Lyon, and has missed most of the last two seasons with injury, is proving a revelation at centre-forward for City, and scored twice. It’s also worth mentioning Jill Scott, an ever-present for City this season and recently named an MBE, a key player for club and country. I don’t know anyone who deserves the honour more.Chelsea are the one team that can play football that is at the same level as Arsenal – they just lack the consistency. The 6-1 win over Bristol City was a 200th game in charge for their manager, Emma Hayes – another MBE – and one of their best performances of the season even if they went a goal down early on and it took them until the 28th minute to draw level. Then it was foot to the floor. City will think the first few goals were all preventable or unlucky: Sophie Baggaley should have claimed the cross from which Beth England equalised, then the second was a big deflection and the third a tap-in after a goalmouth scramble. But in the second half, with Sam Kerr on as a substitute at the break, Chelsea were irresistible. The move for their fifth goal was absolutely beautiful, ending with Guro Reiten’s fantastic low cross from the left and Ji So-yun’s low finish. Ji also played a brilliant through-ball for Kerr, though the Australian’s shot was cleared off the line. If you give Ji time to get her head up and make decisions, she’s unplayable. I don’t believe that Chelsea would have attracted the calibre of player they have in Kerr, Ji and Maren Mjelde – without someone like Hayes at the helm, a coach of the very highest calibre. For Bristol, the 18-year-old striker Ebony Salmon, who scored the only goal against Manchester United last week, was on the scoresheet again and continues to look promising.Reading got their second clean sheet of the season, and their first since September, in a 1-0 win over Birmingham. Given their inconsistency, they would have been delighted not only with the victory but to have a clean 1-0, a welcome novelty for them. The result catapulted them up to fourth, though they are a long way behind third-placed Chelsea, and knocked Birmingham into danger territory. After seven defeats in their last 10 league games Birmingham only have seven points, and with bottom club Liverpool – whose game against Manchester United was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch – looking refreshed and with a good new signing in Rachel Furness, it would only take a couple of results to put them in real peril. Birmingham are a club whose star players – the likes of Ellen White, Karen Carney and Ann-Katrin Berger – never hang around. They were the best of the rest for a few years but now that status has slipped and the danger signs are starting to flash.After beating West Ham 2-1, Tottenham are fifth, and for me have been one of the stories of the season. I think I tipped them to go down, but they play a really enjoyable brand of attacking football, and I see quality build-up play from them on a regular basis. In the likes of Kit Graham and Rianna Dean they have players who are regularly contributing goals. They will be disappointed to lose Rachel Furness, who has now signed for Liverpool, but in this game they showed real character and proved they can win games without her. Spurs and West Ham have both transformed themselves over the last few years, and this was a good gauge of the progress both teams have made. Spurs ended up with the victory, but it was close: Kenza Dali equalised in the last minute, and deep into stoppage time Tessel Middag had a chance to win it for them. But the keeper saved it, and Spurs just broke. That counter-attack showed what they are about, and Spurs are showing this season what confidence, momentum and good coaching can do for a team. It shows great character to let in a last-minute goal and find a winner and I know what that feels like for a footballer: it’s the best thing in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81cdfdbd5d9426ee069a0daaf0c3a9d48a5544cf/0_6_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=368d07404f4a49768becd60b352f6a0d","title":"juventus evolution maurizio sarri serie a roma","story":"New clothes, ‘same dickhead’: for the third time in his career, Maurizio Sarri has his team in pole position at the halfway pointMaurizio Sarri had to update his wardrobe after taking over as manager of Juventus. A man who has always felt most comfortable in a tracksuit showed up for his first day of work in Turin sporting a shirt and tie. He soon confessed that his contract obliged him to wear such a uniform when representing the club away from the football pitch. For matches, a compromise was reached. Sarri’s sideline attire at Juventus has typically featured suit trousers and a zip-neck sweater.Do the clothes make the man? At the end of Juventus’ win over Roma on Sunday, one journalist asked Sarri whether this first half-season at the club had changed him. “I don’t know,” he replied. “My wife tells me I’m the same dickhead I was before.”Certainly, he finds himself in a familiar spot professionally. Sarri has guided his team to first in Serie A at the season’s midway stage, just as he did with Napoli in 2015-16 and 2017-18. His opinion on the significance of being crowned as Italy’s ‘campione d’Inverno’ (winter champion) remains the same as ever: “It’s a title that does not exist.”Since Serie A expanded back to 20 teams in 2004, however, the winter champion has only twice failed to push on and finish in first. The exceptions both belonged to Sarri’s Napoli teams. There was no shame in being outlasted by a Juventus side with far greater financial resources. This time around, he will have no such excuses.Sarri has shown evolution beyond his attire over the past seven months. Previously perceived as a rigid tactician with a tendency to over-rely on certain players, he has shown himself willing to experiment more widely with Juventus’s deep squad.It took less than a month, from the start of the season, for Sarri to abandon his favourite 4-3-3, recognising such a system would not allow him to get the most from Paulo Dybala. The Argentinian was better suited to playing centrally, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in a front two. And when the Portuguese started to struggle with form and fitness, Sarri found ways to get Gonzalo Higuaín on the pitch instead – even if that meant provoking a stadium-exiting strop from Serie A’s most expensive player.Where Sarri started the same eight footballers in more than 30 of Chelsea’s Premier League games last season, only three of his Juventus squad – Ronaldo, Miralem Pjanic and Leonardo Bonucci – have made more than 15 starts. He has used 24 players already between Serie A and the Champions League.The Roma match marked the first time he had named an unchanged side, though it is hard to say whether he got his selection right. Juventus won chiefly because their opponents imploded, conceding twice in the opening 10 minutes. Aleksandar Kolarov’s loose marking allowed Merih Demiral space to score a back-post volley, before a calamitous series of decisions gifted the visitors a penalty. Pau Lopez should never have passed the ball to Jordan Veretout, facing his own goal with Dybala in close attendance, but the Frenchman also dithered after receiving the ball and responded with an instinctive tug on his opponent’s shirt after being dispossessed.Roma were the better team thereafter – at half-time they were 2-0 down but had outshot their opponents 10-3 – yet the loss of Nicolò Zaniolo to a torn cruciate ligament in the 36th minute was a devastating blow. The 20-year-old has been indispensable for Roma this season: offering acceleration and directness in transition. The injury was sustained on a characteristically brilliant dribble that had supporters roaring before he was brought down outside the Juventus box.As he departed on a stretcher, visibly shaking with tears, Ronaldo leaned in and stroked his hair. Zaniolo would later post the image on his Instagram account, promising to come back stronger. It seems unlikely that he will play again before the end of this season, though, his availability for Euro 2020 is also in doubt. There are similar worries for Demiral, who suffered an identical injury jumping under a high ball.Roma remained dogged without Zaniolo but, despite dominating possession and pulling one goal back from the penalty spot, could not carve out the chance they needed to equalise. Juve’s victory moved them two points clear of Inter, who had drawn at home to Atalanta.In truth, the Nerazzurri were fortunate to take a point. They made a perfect start, Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martínez combining before the latter drilled a shot past Pierluigi Gollini. But the goalscorer should have been sent off for a cynical foul before half-time, using his hand to trip Rafael Toloi as the Atalanta player tried to follow up after seeing a header saved at close range.The failure of VAR to intervene remains inexplicable. Yet Atalanta refused to let anger knock them off course. Gian Piero Gasperini withdrew the ineffective Duvan Zapata – making his first start since injuring his thigh in October – and sent on Ruslan Malinovskyi, who dropped into deeper positions and helped to unblock a clogged midfield.Atalanta equalised through Robin Gosens and had their chance to take all the points when Alessandro Bastoni barged into Malinovskyi inside the box in the 88th minute. This time the penalty was awarded. Luis Muriel, who had scored 10 out of 10 Serie A spot-kicks in his career, stepped up to take it. Inter’s goalkeeper, however, excels in situations like these. Samir Handanovic plunged to his right and pushed the ball away. In doing so, he moved alongside Gianluca Pagliuca as the two goalkeepers who have saved the most penalties – 24 apiece – in Serie A history.For Handanovic, this felt overdue. “I hadn’t saved one in two years,” he observed, before his manager recycled familiar laments about the shallowness of Inter’s squad. They were missing two important pieces through suspension here – Milan Skriniar and Nicolò Barella – but tired legs are also a convenient excuse for a team that has faded late in several big games.In any case, the title race remains wide open. Conte shares Sarri’s opinion on the meaninglessness of winter titles. Still, the Inter manager will hope his rival can continue the habit he has had so far, of failing to upgrade them to the real thing.• Zlatan Ibrahimovic reopened his account with Milan, scoring the second goal in a 2-0 win over the suddenly lifeless Cagliari. According to the league’s stat-keepers, he also recorded the second-fastest sprint of any player in a red-and-black shirt. Which, admirable though it is, does feel a bit damning on his teammates who are not approaching a 40th birthday. Boy, do Milan need the help of anyone who can stick the ball in the net, though. They have scored two fewer as a squad than Ciro Immobile on his own. There was another huge one from the Italian to sink Napoli and extend Lazio’s winning run to 10 games.• Not the high point of the season: Verona’s game against Genoa had to be delayed for 15 minutes because the lines of the pitch were wonky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0882d99c5474b6e06e05edb036ac886b8e16902/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f76b5485ae0b6b7adaa42deff39cef","title":"premier league 10 talking points","story":"Bournemouth need to find goals fast, Aubameyang’s red card has caused a headache at Arsenal and Ings is in England formBournemouth’s defending left a lot to be desired as they crumbled against Watford but their failure to penetrate Nigel Pearson’s improving side was equally alarming. No team has scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season and those front–foot displays of yesteryear – they scored almost 100 goals en route to promotion in 2015 and more than any team outside the top six last season – feel a distant memory following a ninth defeat in 11 league matches. “Historically we have always been free-scoring and we have always had goals in us,” their manager, Eddie Howe, said. “We have always had the ability – even if we have conceded first – to come back and win games. That is probably where the feeling has gone missing, the creativity and that feeling we are going to score. We have to do better in that respect.” Ben FisherAnother Liverpool win and another that led to praise for a host of players in red. Quite right too, but there should also be an appreciation of the display delivered by the man in black. Yet again Alisson was outstanding with his positioning and handling, playing as a sweeper on occasion while every shot that came his way was, as ever, held with minimum fuss. No Premier League goalkeeper has a better clean sheets percentage than Alisson this season (46), or has a higher save percentage (83.9). Since arriving from Roma for £66.9m in July 2018 the Brazilian has provided Liverpool with a calm, brilliant authority that was severely lacking during the days of Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius. Should Liverpool, as most people expect, win the title, then Alisson will have contributed as greatly as any outfield player. Sachin NakraniManchester City have stumbled at times this season but the momentum is building nicely now. Kevin De Bruyne keeps getting better, making all the players around him look good, even if Sergio Agüero, Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez hardly need the help. Were Pep Guardiola’s men to embark on a longer hot streak than they did to finish their triumphant 2018-19 campaign, and win their remaining 16 Premier League fixtures, they would finish with 95 points. But considering the form the leaders, Liverpool, are currently in – not to mention their 14-point advantage – this would be nothing more than a minor inconvenience for them. Last season supporters everywhere marvelled at the ludicrous circumstance that a team as good as Liverpool ended up without the title. In May the tables will have turned. Luke McLaughlinThe future of Chelsea’s right flank appeared to be taken care of during the win over Burnley. Reece James and Callum Hudson‑Odoi have risen through the ranks together and their interplay caused plenty of problems for Sean Dyche’s side. James, a right‑back whose crossing ability rivals Trent Alexander-Arnold’s, never stopped marauding forward and Hudson‑Odoi, who is regaining confidence after recovering from a ruptured achilles tendon, capped a fine display with his first Premier League goal. Their understanding was seen in the way they combined for Chelsea’s second, a slick one‑two creating space for James to cross for Tammy Abraham to head home. “Hopefully it’s just the start of the partnership as far as first-team football goes,” Frank Lampard said. “When Callum is being as aggressive as he was today and Reece is behind him, of course it is a big thing.” Jacob SteinbergAs if Mikel Arteta’s in-tray had not been full enough, losing the man he readily calls “probably the most important player” is a blow he could certainly have done without. There were no complaints about Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang’s red card at Crystal Palace but there is a risk his absence for three games will seriously expose the fact that he has bailed Arsenal out on more occasions than anyone would care to remember since arriving in January 2018. The nature of Arteta’s response, with slim resources to call upon, will be important in maintaining the positive vibes he has created. “Hopefully they have to take a step forward now,” he said of those who might shoulder Aubameyang’s burden. “Someone else has to do it and I want to see their reaction too.” It could be a chance for Gabriel Martinelli, the gifted 18-year-old, to reassert his potential. Nick AmesDanny Ings could have had a hat‑trick in Southampton’s impressive comeback win at Leicester. But the 27-year-old’s winner offered more compelling evidence that he is thriving under the tutelage of Ralph Hasenhüttl. Surely a first England call-up since he won his solitary cap under Roy Hodgson against Lithuania in 2015 is now on the cards. Brendan Rodgers, who signed him for Liverpool from Burnley that summer, certainly thinks so. With Jamie Vardy apparently not keen on making himself available for Euro 2020 and Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson badly out of form, Rodgers said Ings is making a strong case after scoring seven times in the league since the start of December. “There’s no doubt,” said the Leicester manager. “He just needs to keep the consistency and availability and he’ll show he’s one of the best strikers about.” Ed Aarons On Sunday it will be a year since Manchester United last won three consecutive league games. As Harry Maguire identified after this convincing victory against Norwich, Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side are leading a hand-to-mouth existence. “Our problem has been inconsistency,” he said. “We have played two good games and one bad and it has not been good enough. We are not getting carried away. It was a good performance, a clean sheet, a win, but we have to go again on Wednesday and get another good result.” That is an FA Cup replay against Wolves. At least United do have a supremely consistent performer in Marcus Rashford – scorer of two against Norwich on his 200th appearance. “He’s a top player with top quality,” Maguire said. “He has everything.” Sunday’s opponents, though, are Liverpool at Anfield, so United may suffer another setback. Jamie JacksonThe controversy surrounding Robert Snodgrass’s disallowed goal may comfortably overshadow West Ham’s performance at Sheffield United on Friday night but there were serious concerns away from VAR for David Moyes to digest. The Hammers’ pursuit of a new goalkeeper – with Middlesbrough’s Darren Randolph still on their radar – will likely have intensified over the weekend, with Lukasz Fabianski seemingly suffering a recurrence of his hip injury and another error from his replacement. David Martin’s mistake, which led to Oli McBurnie’s winner, was the latest example of the Hammers’ deep-lying issues in goal, something Moyes will need to resolve quickly if he is to steer the Hammers away from the relegation zone. Throw in their lack of potency up front and this was a frustrating night for West Ham long before VAR intervened. Aaron Bower Carlo Ancelotti was quite diplomatic about the fourth-minute penalty Everton were denied against Brighton, considering a goal so early might have lifted the post-derby gloom almost immediately. “I think it was a penalty,” the manager said of the incident when Lewis Dunk clearly pulled Theo Walcott’s shirt as he tried to reach Dominic Calvert‑Lewin’s flick and attempt a shot. “But Theo didn’t go down and that made the referee’s job quite difficult.” True, though even after a VAR check the penalty was refused, despite the tug being visible to most in the ground. If the combination of officials who studied it decided advantage needed to be played because Walcott was still on his feet with a chance of scoring, the result will be managers telling their players to go to ground at every opportunity – especially if their finishing is as weak as Walcott’s. Paul WilsonSomething about Wolves’ draw with Newcastle suggested Nuno Espírito Santo was sending a message to his bosses. With Diogo Jota injured, Pedro Neto was given a chance to shine. He struggled, not the only summer signing to do so at Molineux this season, with Jesús Vallejo and Patrick Cutrone having already departed. But Neto stayed on until the 85th minute as Wolves laboured in their hunt for a winner. One look at the bench showed why: a collection of inexperienced players, with the 21-year-old Benny Ashley-Seal, who made his full debut last week, the only forward. The message was plain: Wolves are short of attacking options. Nuno made clear to the media he wants new forwards in this window, as he has been doing for some time, but on this occasion he may have chosen other means to get his point across.

They are now married and live in MyanmarWhen Ebola swept through west Africa in 2014, many foreign workers were evacuated from the region. For Rachel, who had been working on an educational development project in Liberia, being sent home to Britain was frustrating. “I really wanted to support colleagues. I felt so helpless.”In early 2015, she was given the all-clear to head back to the city of Monrovia. “I was meant to be meeting a friend for dinner and she told me she was bringing her new colleague, Stephen,” she says. After a tough few weeks, Rachel wasn’t in the mood to meet new people. “Plus, she’d heard I was American,” says Stephen, with a smile. “The worst.”But the pair spent the whole evening laughing. “I was working for an NGO at the time and doing work for the ministry of health,” says Stephen. “It’s an intense environment out there, but we were being silly and joking around.”Over the next few weeks, the pair grew closer as they organised events to distract their friends from the health crisis. “It was a tough time, so we needed some escapism,” explains Rachel. “We started the Monday movie club and spent more time together.”After two months, the pair took the first step towards something more serious.“He took me on a surprise date, but he needed me to drive there,” Rachel says. Stephen adds: “I think we were both nervous in the car. If something went wrong, it would have been a very awkward drive home.”When they arrived at their destination – a park with a golf course – they sat down for a picnic. “It was such a lovely day – like no date I’d ever been on before,” she says. “Although we did have to dodge a few golf balls.”Two weeks later, they were living together. “We hardly spent a night apart from then on,” says Rachel.That year, they travelled to Stephen’s home in Pennsylvania for Thanksgiving, followed by a trip to Scotland for Christmas with Rachel’s family. In August 2016, they moved to the north of England to study for their master’s degrees. “I went to Leeds University,” Stephen says. “Rachel went to Durham and we lived in York. It’s a beautiful place.”During their year in the UK, they got engaged. “We were on a country walk in Scotland and I proposed with two rings I’d brought back from Liberia,” says Rachel. For Stephen, it was a lovely surprise, although he admits it took him a while to cotton on. “She was holding the rings behind me in a selfie and I didn’t spot them at first. When I was realised, it was amazing. We basically pranced back down the hill.” Rachel says she planned the proposal because she had always wanted an “equal partnership”.The pair married in the US in December 2017, before moving to Myanmar. “Stephen is now working with the same NGO, on malaria elimination, and I’m an international development consultant here,” Rachel says. When they are not busy with work, they enjoy cooking in their home in Yangon. “Going to markets and getting creative in the kitchen is something we love,” says Stephen. “I cook the basics and Rachel does all the details. I call her the spice to my rice.”Rachel says she loves the way her husband treats everyone with respect. “He’s also very open about his feelings. As a Brit, it was quite overwhelming at first, but I love that he has helped me to talk more and open up.” Stephen has always been there for her. “In 2016, I was caught up in the Brussels terror attacks. I felt so supported by him. Any difficulties we have faced have only made us stronger.”“Rachel makes everyone in her life feel special,” Stephen says. “She is so inspiring to me and I love her positive energy. She is like no one else I have ever met.” At some point, they want to start a family, but for now they are just happy to be together. “I’m from the US and Rachel is from the UK, so the most important thing is that we are able to live in the same country,” Stephen says. “We’re excited about all the adventures to come.”• Want to share your story?

Rediscovering singing proved the turning point I neededWhen it comes to looking after your mental health, there is a lot of advice about what to start doing and what to stop, but sometimes the remedy is something that has been in the background all along. Which poses the question: what have I stopped doing that once made me, me?About six years ago I started having panic attacks. I began my journey to crack them with traditional tools, including therapy, keeping active, meditation and medication, all of which were a great help. Thankfully, a year later medication was no longer needed and neither was therapy. Problem solved.Frustratingly, about a year after that, when I was seemingly happy and healthy, I started to develop depression and began to have panic attacks once again, and this time they were far more debilitating. I tried what I knew best and went back to my previous toolkit, but I was still struggling and far from feeling well again. Until I got some new advice.My childhood had been filled with creativity. School and, later, university burst at the seams with music, art and dancing, yet for most of my adult life these outlets had been neglected. A therapist I had been seeing told me that mental health issues are incredibly common among the creative minds of the world, the so-called “tortured artist” no surprises there. Yet what we explored was the opposite: what happens when your creativity is suppressed, when you hold back an energy that is ingrained in you? I began to wonder if part of my mental health struggles could be due to the neglect of my creativity: dormant self-expression going nowhere and morphing into anxiety.I love to sing and, when I was younger, I did what a lot of teens did in the 90s: formed a band, learned every Spice Girls routine out there and performed them at school assembly (or the occasional after-school concert with our soon-to-be-famous signatures on the back of each ticket). To rekindle my creative side, I decided to get back into singing and audition for every top established Renaissance chamber choir. Not very Spice Girls. Not so smart.Then I discovered a group called Sound, a pop, funk and soul choir that sings the likes of Beyoncé, Janelle Monáe and Queen. Much better. And in what was a particularly dark patch for me, I found the courage to audition. I was amazed that I managed to put myself through such a high-stakes situation and not have a panic attack. The audition itself was a win for me, never mind how I did.I remember clearly the day I got the email saying they would love me to join them. I was on the top deck of a bus and let out a loud squeal of jubilation. I could not stop smiling to myself for the rest of the journey. It meant a lot.I have now been a member of the choir for three years, rehearsing every Tuesday. I love the community, the challenge, the performances and the fire it lights in my belly. It reminds me of who I was at school. My path back then was always “do what you love and do what you’re good at”. I studied dance because I loved it and sang because I loved it, and my entire education was filled with fond memories because of that, and I was now starting to build that back into my adult life.Although my job is in the creative industry, the day-to-day skills I use are not so I have had to learn the importance of finding time to include creativity in my life. I sing, go to dance classes and make my own Christmas cards. I fear that if these creative outlets stagnate I may relapse and if keeping healthy means doing things I love all the time, I am certainly not going to complain.My anxiety attacks came out of nowhere and, to this day, I am still clueless as to what sets them off. Now, though, I am feeling a lot better. When I am anxious, distraction is key and singing does exactly that. It sends me into autopilot, a state in which my body works without instruction, but with pure passion and joy – a meditative state.Don’t get me wrong, there are weeks when the last thing I want to do after work is go to choir practice and I long to go home to bed. But I go because I know I am guaranteed to come out feeling great. I will leave having loved every second, learned something new and progressed my vocal skills. More importantly, I will have exercised my creativity and held my anxiety at bay. What more could I ask for?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b237fe8189a25521d1aaaa8c1c330d3029062c85/0_0_3029_1615/master/3029.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7125f37c6f8b88ace05046813bee1656 1440w","title":"day6 review k rock brixton academy london","story":"Brixton Academy, LondonScissor-kicking, Seoul-based outfit delight fans with a celebration of sweet chaos on their second UK appearance Sympathy is extended to Day6 fans who arrive too late to bag a spot at the front of the queue.

Speaking of wedding bands, you could do much worse for your nuptials than booking Princesteen, a covers band who alternate between Prince and Bruce Springsteen, and Self Esteem also blasts through the indie with tightly harmonised pop originals that recall girl groups from the Ronettes to En Vogue.Heavier moments include post-punk trio the Sweet Release of Death, who build an intense atmosphere between their peppy rhythm section and a gorgeous squall of echoing lead guitar. Nova Twins get a wild reception for their assault of double fuzz-guitars and rap-rock vocals somewhere between Zack de la Rocha and Nicki Minaj at her most eyelid-retracted Life, with a frontman in the same narcissistic-mime heritage as Jarvis Cocker and Alex Kapranos, blaze at high speed through robust, ranting post-punk pop songs.Headlining is John Cale, with a set that has some ponderous sub-Scott Walker moments obliterated with a psychedelic nosee through Waiting for the Man. Jesus and Mary Chain round off Saturday with a reminder that, for all their occasional tendency towards haze, they’re a rock’n’roll band. Jim Reid’s voice initially feels too thin, a papery reed buzzing in the wind, but this soon becomes the core of their appeal – it’s as if he slinks up to you through the fog and inveigles himself, letting you in on secrets: “I want to die just like JFK …” And closing the weekend are Fontaines DC, who are energetic but moodier than on record, the chirpy musicality of Grian Chatten’s melodies pared down into a flatter bleat. It’s as dourly beautiful as a January day, much like this entire festival – it lacks the razzle and ambition of a major summer event, and some of the music is a little grey, but it is nonetheless a spirited alternative to a weekend spent spiralising courgettes and looking up yoga routines on YouTube."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45554736df25f57f4a4f1f37fc22f3a644a6d778/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=650789bb9fb47bd5b1afd0b9bc48233f","title":"standing room only and a hungry stork sundays best photos","story":"’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world, including a protest race in Bangkok and a volcanic eruption in the Philippines"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f35e88b2d745a79d9267ca820d087e791c46026b/0_35_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c7bcfa4d0c38379dd4a0743d6679bf","title":"brexit irish border uk northern ireland","story":"Northern Ireland customs plans could take five years to implement, IfG saysThe Irish border could yet snag Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, with experts saying it will be impossible to deliver the computer systems for the special arrangements for Northern Ireland by the end of this year. Failure to implement the new systems will risk legal action by the European commission against Britain, the Institute for Government says.Johnson’s government remains adamant that there will be no checks or new reporting systems on trade crossing the Irish sea, despite Ireland and the EU insisting that those would have to be in place to protect the Irish border.The prime minister’s intention to establish a trade deal with the EU by the end of December 2020 was also dealt a blow by Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, at the weekend as he indicated the bloc would be in no rush to work to Johnson’s timetable.In a blunt assessment of the likelihood of satisfying Johnson’s “ambitious” vision, he said the fact that Britain had put the timescale for a trade deal into law did not mean the other 27 European countries would fall in line. “In my view, it’s probably going to take longer than a year,” he said.The IfG’s report says HMRC has previously stated similar systems to the proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland would take five years to develop and implement.Part of the problem is that until the new trade deal between the UK and the EU is struck, the details of the Northern Ireland arrangements cannot be finalised.The complicated system for Northern Ireland involves the region effectively staying in the single market but in the UK customs zone. This potentially means tariff charges and rebates, paperwork and physical checks on certain fresh foods and live animals going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.In the new report, “Getting Brexit done: what happens now?”, the IfG says Brexit will be far from done on 31 January when the UK formally leaves the EU with the expected ratification of the withdrawal agreement ending the article 50 process.“The UK will formally leave the EU at the end of January, and in that sense Brexit will be done, but many of the biggest Brexit jobs will be far from over,” it says. “It will continue to dominate government for years to come. The prime minister may hope to end Brexit’s dominance in the public debate after 31 January, but in Whitehall it will continue to be the biggest and most challenging task faced by a government in decades.”Under the deal sealed by Johnson with the EU last October, animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to some physical checks, with a tariff and tariff rebate system operating for the first time. These are there to protect any substandard goods seeping into the EU’s single market through smuggling over the Irish border into the Republic of Ireland.While all sides recognise the complexities of the new system, little public attention has been paid to the fact that new computer systems cannot be designed by either HMRC, ferry companies, or manufacturers or suppliers like Tesco until the trade deal with the EU is done.The report says: “With the details of how the border will operate still unclear – and likely to be so for some months – and no preparatory work having happened for checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 11-month timeline is almost certainly undeliverable.”It notes that Sir Jon Thompson, a former chief executive of HMRC, said that a similar customs systems involving rebates could take up to five years to develop and implement.Coveney issued his warning on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, saying the deal to be struck between the UK and EU over their future relationship was vast, encompassing security, data, aviation and trade.He said: “When people talk about the future relationship in the UK in particular, they seem to only talk about a future trade agreement. Actually, there’s much more to this than that … I know that Johnson has set a very ambitious timetable to get this done – he’s even put it into British law – but just because a British parliament decides that British law says something, doesn’t mean that that law applies to the other 27 countries of the European Union.“And so the European Union will approach this on the basis of getting the best deal possible, a fair and balanced deal, to ensure that the UK and the EU can interact as friends in the future. But the EU will not be rushed on this just because Britain passes a law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656a0ded9a25cfeebd1cfe121e10cb28c4f7485c/0_201_5415_3249/master/5415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb824fd3b531af89242c6be1ac05703d","title":"city access eu markets eu fleets uk fishing rights brexit","story":"Commissioner says Europe will seek fishery access and UK will want concessions for CityThe EU’s trade commissioner has suggested there could be a last-minute trade-off with Brussels offering the City of London access to European markets in return for European fleets retaining their fishing rights in British waters.The UK’s financial services sector will lose its automatic right to serve Europe-based clients at the end of the transition period and the EU will need to negotiate access to UK waters for its fishing boats.Phil Hogan, the former Irish minister who is now trade commissioner in Brussels overseeing the next stage of the Brexit negotiations, told the Irish Independent: “There certainly will be trade-offs, particularly at the end of the negotiations. The EU will be seeking concessions on fishery access and the UK will very probably be seeking concessions on financial services.”Hogan, a longstanding critic of prominent Brexiters including Boris Johnson, described claims that the EU would be put under pressure to seal a deal by parallel UK-US negotiations as “fairytale economics”.Negotiations of the future relationship between the EU and the UK after 31 January, the scheduled date for Brexit, are expected to start in early March once both sides have settled positions on the main issues.Speaking in Luxembourg on Monday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said the British government would need to sign up to a series of commitments on state aid, environmental and labour standards to allow tariff- and quota-free trade.She said: “Great Britain is our friend, the Brits are our friends, it is a friendship that has been growing for a long time but we have to break new ground with each other, and here it applies as well: it is the decision of Great Britain how close or distant of the biggest single market in the world they want to be.“The closer they are, meaning a level playing field, the more they are ready to respect the European rules, the easier accession to the European single market will be. The further away, the less there is of a level playing field, the more difficult their access to the European single market will be. It is a decision Great Britain has to make and in the negotiations we will have to sound out the scope that we want to use to then determine the negotiations accordingly.”Last week, Andrej Plenković, Croatia’s prime minister, whose country is taking over the presidency of the EU, conceded that Brussels would be unashamedly “political” and could threaten to block the City of London’s access to European markets if Johnson tries to exempt the UK from its laws. He also warned of the risk of skirmishes at sea similar to those during the 1970s cod wars if a deal on fishing rights was not secured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005664f5d4d6232bcf5bfde2ccabc45e44aa0eac/149_0_4658_2796/master/4658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4109bc03a6e7125984613cf7cb3a11f7","title":"understated beauty great brands have one big idea that chimes with people","story":"For a brand such as Audi, form really does follow function – which translates into designs that instill a sense of reliability, efficiency and trustIt was the audacious simplicity of it. At last year’s Milan Design Week, a giant ring was suspended inside the courtyard of the city’s Seminario Arcivescovile, a seminary that was built in 1564.Ma Yansong, the founder of MAD Architects, which developed the installation with Audi, explained the thinking behind it: “The illuminated ring in the square boundary of the historical courtyard stands for mankind’s strive for perfection.”The installation, called “Fifth Ring”, was arguably a perfect metaphor for a design aesthetic that has long been associated with the German carmaker. The air of quiet confidence. The understated beauty. Its sheer efficiency.But the aesthetic is also a business ethos rendered into physical form.“Audi are an interesting brand in the way they tapped very deliberately into the whole German design aesthetic of engineering efficiency, rationality and modernity,” says Jeremy Myerson, chair of design at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design at the Royal College of Art and founding editor of Design Week. “Those values go back to the Bauhaus roots of good form, everything precisely as it needs to be – and there is still commercial equity in that, as we’ve seen in brands like Apple. The idea is that in a complex world you need simplicity, and that continues to hold its own.”Audi has made a virtue of those principles in its adherence to functionality and to the concept of progress through technology (better known as vorsprung durch technik). It’s a subtle message with a powerful appeal. The beauty of its cars flow from fundamental engineering values that feed into quality and consistency.“Most great brands have one big emotional idea, very simple, very recognisable and it chimes with people,” says Myerson, “You buy an Audi because you’re identifying emotionally in a high quality, technical machine. It instils ideas of reliability and efficiency – trust essentially. And that’s what the best brands are about.”Simplicity should never be mistaken for predictability or dullness. Audi has always been ready to push the envelope, whether it came to the aerodynamics of its iconic 1980s Quattro or the sporty elegance of the TT.“Audi has always been able to be creative within its own defined rules,” says Howard Guy, co-managing director of automotive and aviation consultancy, Design Q. “They were the first manufacturer to start using materials and finishes that play off each other very imaginatively. For instance, the TT dash had a superb grain, a texture and softness which didn’t make it feel like it was a great big injection-moulded piece of plastic like most things at the time. There were little details, a bit of gloss, a bit of brushed aluminium, the way the materials were brought together that was very refreshing and everyone began to copy it. It’s about perception, the way of making something mass market look expensive. It’s clever because it’s about playing with surfaces and colours – things that don’t cost much. It’s the same approach that makes for a great handbag.”Audi’s lesson is one of boldness and confidence in its ability to take materials and technology and synthesise them into something that symbolises progress in an elegantly understated way, whether it be the Audi A8 aluminium Space Frame of the early 1990s or the 1995 TT coupe that has proved so enduring.“The very first TT had the baseball interior with the heavy leather seats with the huge stitching. Nobody had done that before or been bold enough,” says Guy. “They were very sure of their ground. When it came to those great cars, they did it with courage and that’s a disappearing value in the car industry today, there’s so much to lose, everyone plays safe.”The danger of homogeneity must always be set against destroying core values and Audi’s heritage has meant a consistency of approach. It is a premium brand and everything stays as in tune to that as its legendarily reliable engines.Embracing new technology in the shape of electrical motors and AI brings new challenges, but you expect that core principle of form following function will always provide a solution that connects with its audience. The Audi Q4 e-tron concept features recycled plastic fabric and sustainable paint developed to reflect sunlight so the car requires less air-conditioning.Being ahead of the curve while remaining faithful to its ideals is how Audi has managed to match its engineering prowess with an equally impressive design aesthetic. In short, it’s the Audi way of doing business – and it’s also why the phrase vorsprung durch technik has become synonymous with the brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e2e57200c7d31c88c598305cdeb5c21efef36b/0_215_6333_3800/master/6333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8178c3b8fc24b2d66ab235b0404322d","title":"my working week teenage gang target help","story":"As a youth advocate at a charity, I fight for children and young people to get the help from services they are entitled toI’m an advocate at a charity that supports young people who’ve been referred from other organisations or have come to us themselves. I call a client, Ethan*, at around 9am. He’s 15 and out of school because his friends and his postcode make him a target for a local gang. He studies at home but has fallen behind.Ethan and I revise a letter I’ve drafted to his local council requesting a move to another borough. His council doubts the veracity of his story and has refused previous requests.At 9.45am I arrive at a housing office to support a homeless client. Once I’m done with security I head upstairs to find Paige, 19, sitting with black bags containing all her possessions. As a care leaver, Paige should have been supported into independence and a secure home. However, she was asked to leave her accommodation when she was 17 and so began her life on and off the streets.We are seen at 3pm by a housing officer who directs our attention to a pictogram on the wall depicting the number of properties sought against the fraction provided. She says we’re her eighth case today. After 40 minutes of enquiries and attempts to refer Paige’s case to another borough, she agrees to provide emergency accommodation.I support Callum, 18 and a care leaver, at a meeting to discuss his rent arrears with a representative from his landlord and his personal adviser (PA), a person employed by the local authority to support its care leavers. His PA refuses to acknowledge that by referring Callum’s case to the housing department when he presented as homeless at 16, thereby making him liable for rent, the local authority set him up to fail. As a result he has begun adulthood already drowning in debt. Thankfully the representative for the landlord agrees – much to the frustration of Callum’s PA, who reluctantly agrees to ask for support from the local authority. In the morning I support Chloe, 19, at a meeting with children’s services. She is balancing her education with fighting to keep her children, and is asking for a contact arrangement that’s compatible with her college timetable. Her tenacity and grit is inspiring. Despite the many concerns raised about her learning disabilities, she continues to aim high, engage with services and surpass others’ expectations.I meet Jacob, who is 16. During our brief discussion outside the housing office, he tells me he spent Monday and Tuesday evening riding the night bus, and last night on a friend’s sofa. I have found that young people aged 16 and up have a particularly difficult time accessing children’s services support.I arrive at my first appointment to support Luke, 17 and a looked-after child, at a meeting with professionals supporting him. His “non-engagement” is the prevailing theme.This description, used far too often as a reason for withdrawing support, reflects the chronic lack of accountability across services. Luke had struggled for nearly six months to get out from his hostile home life. Young people in this kind of situation are doubly disadvantaged: once by failing services and by their own response to those failures. Luke’s education suffered, his mental health plummeted and he started smoking marijuana. Because of the long delays, this will be Luke’s only meeting. He will be 18 next week and no longer eligible for this support.On my way back to the office I receive a call from Ethan, informing me that his local authority has agreed to send him to a school in a borough where he is safe. Great news.Advocacy often leaves me feeling dispirited. Fighting for resources that don’t exist in the quantity needed is exhausting. It can often feel hopeless, as though I’m transporting young people from one crisis into another within a system that is seemingly imploding.But I’ve also seen what happens when the work continues in spite of all these difficulties. For those who give support and for those who receive it, I’ve seen the smallest respite from chaotic situations reveal aspects of creativity, aspiration and aptitude that surprise even the young people themselves. It is a privilege to say farewell to someone at the end of a chaotic experience, after supporting them throughout – and it is confirmation that even the worst situations can and do change.*All clients’ names have been changed.If you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/466a532c2cab103f5e31b59cc8a0c6c9daf194c9/0_144_3510_2106/master/3510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5740d6590203be2f72cf689e1767bd","title":"england appoint simon amor matt proudfoot coaches rugby union","story":"Ten weeks and three months after South Africa’s pack laid the foundation for World Cup victory over England, Eddie Jones has turned to the Springboks’ forwards coach Matt Proudfoot as he starts counting down to the 2023 tournament in France.Proudfoot, a South Africa who won four caps as a prop for Scotland, will be responsible for all aspects of England’s forward play. The 47-year old has replaced Neal Hatley, who is part of Bath’s coaching team, while Steve Borthwick, who is expected to join Leicester after the Six Nations, is given a new role as forwards coach.Jones has also appointed a new attack coach, Simon Amor, to replace Scott Wisemantel who is part of the Wallabies’ management team under Dave Rennie. Amor will return to his current job as head of the England Sevens men’s and women’s programme after the Six Nations to prepare for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, before severing his connection with the shorter form of the game.“The Six Nations is a fresh start for the team so that is how we have approached our coaching staff,” said Jones. “We felt we needed to regenerate the forwards coaching area with Neal moving to Bath. Matt Proudfoot has had an outstanding coaching career to date, culminating in being a World Cup winning coach with South Africa.“He brings great technical expertise and knowledge having coached in South Africa and Japan and having played in Scotland and South Africa. We feel he can take the forwards to another level and build on the great work Neal and Steve have done over the last four years.”Proudfoot spent seven years in Scotland after joining Melrose in 1997, qualifying for the national side through a grandfather who was born in Dumfries. He became a scrum consultant with the Stormers in 2009, appointed by Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s head coach in last year’s World Cup, and had a stint with Kobe Steelers in Japan before becoming part of the Springboks’ management team in 2016.“England is probably the best team in world rugby to coach,” he said. “Having coached against them you get to respect their identity so to get the opportunity to be part of that is a huge honour. I am really grateful to Eddie, the rest of the coaching staff and the Rugby Football Union to be given this chance. It is a decision I take with great humility and responsibility and know there is a huge legacy to live up to. I look forward to taking that challenge on and doing England proud.”Amor, who played at scrum-half for Gloucester, Wasps and London Irish, has been with England Sevens since 2013 and is a former performance advisor at UK Sport. He will shape the attack with Jones and Borthwick having responsibility for skills. John Mitchell remains in charge of the defence.“This opportunity to work at the highest level for my country is something I am incredibly passionate about and I am honoured to be joining Eddie’s coaching team,” said the 40-year old Amor. “The things I am most excited about are being able to learn in this environment and having an opportunity to help improve some great players and the team. I’m also keen to work closely with the Premiership club coaches, keep improving and getting better myself, further developing what I’ve learned in my career so far.”Jones believes Amor is a natural replacement for Wisemantel. “We have had our eyes on Simon for a while,” he said. “We used him in the run-up to the World Cup in some training camps. I have been very impressed with his dynamism and his rugby intellect. He will bring a fresh view on how we build our attack. We have done some great things under Scott Wisemantel and we will always be forever grateful for the work he did, but we are excited about Simon coming in and what he is going to bring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/776e344e6c3f80dcd7a1a6401b63bc0585c9cf2d/0_181_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d03828e33d34f6289abae49271c82b","title":"talking horses debate over deals with betting firms to rumble on","story":"Altior’s withdrawal put the spotlight on how trainers with bookmaker deals should handle market-sensitive informationThe increasingly vexed question of whether trainers and other licence holders should enter commercial associations with betting firms seems likely to be the subject of discussions between trade bodies and the British Horseracing Authority over the days and weeks ahead, though perhaps not quite so imminently as seemed the case on Sunday morning.“My reference to the regular liaison meetings between the NTF and the BHA was to explain why I would expect the BHA to discuss with the NTF any change of policy affecting trainers. There was no such liaison meeting planned for today.” Arnold also says the BHA has assured him “there is no plan to announce anything” with regard to the issue this week.Such deals between bookmakers and trainers or jockeys have been the subject of renewed attention following the events surrounding the eventual scratching of Nicky Henderson’s top chaser Altior from the Silviniaco Conti Chase at Kempton on Saturday, but have also attracted adverse comment in the past and seem likely to continue to do so in future.Commercial deals with betting firms can be highly lucrative, with racecourse rumour frequently suggesting some run to six figures. For instance, Henderson and Paul Nicholls, his perennial rival for the jumps trainers’ championship, give assessments of their runners’ prospects on big days to Unibet and Betfair respectively, while Ryan Moore, Aidan O’Brien’s stable jockey, also has a regular blog on Betfair during the Flat season. For the most part, their words are chosen carefully by ghost-writers, and do not encourage anyone to bet their house on (or against) one of their runners.The issue with the “schmozzle”, as Henderson put it, around Altior though, specifically concerns how a trainer in a commercial relationship with a bookmaker handles market-sensitive information. The BHA’s “Guidelines for Betting Organisations who have entered in a Commercial Arrangement with Jockeys and Trainers” seems fairly clear. “For ‘high-profile’ horses,” it says, “the appropriateness of market-sensitive information should be strongly considered before it is first made available to the public through media hosted by the betting operator (or its representatives).”A separate section headed “Perception” says that any betting firm hosting such a blog should “be mindful of perception at all times”. It goes on: “Whilst whatever content appears on media hosted by a betting operator or through a representative may be considered to be perfectly appropriate and within the Rules of Racing, do consider how it might be perceived by the betting public and other stakeholders.”And in a social media age when a tweet or meme can be around the globe in seconds, perception matters. A high-profile horse drifting from long odds-on to 5-2 while a stable companion goes headlong in the opposition direction is a terrible look, for all that the actual amount of money laid was probably minimal, bookies “refunded” what little, if anything, they had taken for Altior, and Top Notch, as it turned out, did not even make the frame.Whenever the issue is finally addressed, what needs to be juggled in any discussions between the NTF and BHA is whether the undoubted financial gain to a relatively small number of trainers and jockeys – and a less measurable benefit to the customers of certain bookies – is worth the potential damage if the punters as a whole get hold of the idea that they are being taken for a ride. When it finally arrives, it could be quite a debate.The meeting at Punchestown has been called off with the anticipated approach of Storm Brendan from the Atlantic, as its gale force winds are expected to be at their peak in County Kildare come the afternoon, but Lingfield’s card is no longer under threat and the Surrey track will stage the only jumping in Britain or Ireland.Mole Trap (2.40) could be the value bet there, having returned from 19 months on the sidelines with a gritty win at Hereford in December, while at Southwell National Anthem (12.55) is another runner with a similar profile – long absence, impressive winning return – who catches the eye. Suitcase ‘N’ Taxi (2.30) can register a fifth win of the winter over track and trip on the same card, while Kaser (6.20) is the standout bet at Wolverhampton later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0147f16fe9feef1ae36b879b66796de0c28d13a7/239_0_3532_2121/master/3532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6249c3376de9b3726943eae4fa5701a2","title":"a bullet dodged can winter love island survive its controversies","story":"The reality show is riddled with issues – and adding a new series reeks of desperation. Is this the beginning of the end for the ITV2 behemoth? Love Island has occupied a weird spot in the heart of British culture for a few years now, at once able to be adored by the public at large and intellectualised to death by broadsheet newspapers. But you have to admit that, if the wheels were ever going to come off, they’ll come off now.The controversy regarding the suicides of two former contestants, and the questions asked of ITV about the level of aftercare afforded to them, did Love Island no favours. And the sudden change in personnel, with Laura Whitmore being drafted in at the last minute after previous host Caroline Flack (who denies all claims) was accused of bludgeoning her boyfriend’s head with a table lamp in his sleep, couldn’t have come at a worse time. And now there is a winter Love Island series, the first episode of which debuted last night.This might be the biggest danger of all. The show has moved past the other issues especially Flack, who in reality didn’t actually contribute very much. But adding a second annual series reeks of desperation. Oversaturation has already killed everything from Big Brother to X Factor, and at this rate Love Island might be next. It now needs to source twice as many contestants a year without demonstrating a drop in quality. Surely there aren’t enough identical preening berks in the UK to sustain that sort of output.But good news! Apparently there are! The opening episode was textbook Love Island. The boys were all woy-oy sixpacks and cartoon teeth. The girls all uniformly looked as if they required the services of an osteopath from struggling under the weight of their own eyebrows. One contestant claims she was the inspiration for that song Lewis Capaldi wrote about his horrible girlfriend. Another’s chat-up line was “If my dad dies, I become a lord.” One boy observed the full, beautiful, dramatic sweep of humanity with all its gorgeous and heartbreaking nuances before declaring that his greatest wish in life was to have a girlfriend with nice eyebrows. Meanwhile, the girls quickly agreed that they really wanted to find a boy with a personality. That’s it. That’s as detailed as the discussion got.Nor has the new winter setting altered the format. Part of me was hoping that a show called Winter Love Island would really lean into the title, and consist of nothing but introverts in big coats avoiding eye contact over cups of tea during a slating blizzard in Bognor. But no. Like always, it was just loads of slow motion footage of women in bikinis Here Come The Girlsing their way across some decking for what felt like hours at a time. God, there is so much slow motion on Love Island. If ITV would play the whole thing at normal speed, the entire series would be over by Wednesday.Obviously it’s pointless to truly judge a reality show by its first episode, because all the really entertaining fights and handjobs and ugly personality schisms won’t occur for another week or so. But already the show is doing a good job at pointing us towards potential baddies. Key among them are Connor – a man who genuinely bought his teeth on Google – who has already shown himself to be needy and vindictive in equal measure and Ollie, who is posh.And then there are The Twins, Eve and Jessica, who sent the status quo haywire in the dying moments of last night’s episode by tottering in like a pair of Paris Hilton androids sent loopy by a rogue Lambrini spill. By being twins with boobs, they currently represent the biggest threat to every single rock solid 45-minute-old relationship inside the villa.So far, we can rack up this series as a bullet dodged. For better or worse, Winter Love Island is exactly the same as Summer Love Island. If you didn’t like the original, there is nothing to suggest that you’ll suddenly come around to it now. But if you’re a fan, knock yourselves out. Now you get to spend two seasons a year feeling bad about your physical appearance instead of just one. Saints be praised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd08481f4520f443605929f7a1d5016a730faad0/0_177_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce98556cf18ed7348f5888e7edfa9061","title":"successions brian cox i was touched up by princess margaret","story":"Fresh from winning a Golden Globe for his portrayal of media tycoon Logan Roy, the actor talks about class, cannabis and an odd royal encounterDoing an interview over the phone can be a thankless job: lines get crossed, you awkwardly interrupt one another and, without the intimacy of a face to face encounter, it’s hard to get a sense of the other person. But doing a phone interview with Brian Cox – the acclaimed actor, that is, not the pop-star-turned-particle-physicist with the same name – is such a hoot that if we met in person I would have probably dissolved into a puddle of hysteria.“No, no, not now, I’m having an important conversation!” he barks when someone has the temerity to try to enter his hotel room 45 minutes into our chat. “So where was I? Ah yes …” And he launches back into the anecdote about the time Princess Margaret felt him up. The man has so much charisma – and so many anecdotes – to burn, I can practically feel my phone melting against my face.Cox has a place in north London, as well as a family home in New York, where he lives with his wife, Nicole Ansari, and their two sons. But we are talking by phone because he is still in Los Angeles, celebrating his triumph at the Golden Globes last weekend. He was named best actor in a TV series for his role on HBO’s Succession as Logan Roy, the oligarch who occasionally encourages but largely torments his four grasping, feuding children. The show (which was created by Peep Show’s Jesse Armstrong and will shoot its third season this year) is brilliant on wealth, media tycoons and corrupt dynastic families and feels breathtakingly of the moment. But the smart writing and acting make it timeless. Cox’s performance as the inscrutable then suddenly, terrifyingly, raging centre of the family already feels definitive.Yet when his name was announced last Sunday, he was shocked. “Well, you never know with these things, do you? I thought I was maybe in with a chance, if only from a longevity point of view,” he says with a low rumble of a laugh. At 73, he will celebrate 60 years in the business next year. “I’m just surprised I’m still standing, I really am,” he says.Afterwards, he celebrated his win – and Succession’s win, which was named best TV drama – by “taking lots of selfies”. Elton John paid his respects: “He was very praising of my Churchill, which was kind,” says Cox, who played the PM in the eponymous 2017 film. Leonardo DiCaprio also stopped by to tell him: “I’ve always wanted to work with you.” “Well, you’ve taken long enough about it,” Cox growled back. Has Cox always wanted to work with DiCaprio? “Mmmm, I don’t think in those terms,” he says affably.Mainly he celebrated with the cast, even giving Kieran Culkin, who plays Cox’s onscreen son, a big kiss on the mouth as he went up to get his award. “I’m close to all my boys. We’re very family-like, which is ironic as we play such a dysfunctional family,” he says.I ask if that closeness makes it harder for him to torture them on the show, such as in the infamous “boar on the floor” segment, when Logan makes family members scrabble for sausages.“No, I love being nasty to my children!” he cackles.Given that Cox is one of Britain’s most prolific actors, celebrated as much for his theatre work (he won an Olivier in 1988 for Titus Andronicus) as he is for his TV roles (Nuremberg, Deadwood, Bob Servant Independent) and film successes (Manhunter, Braveheart, Super Troupers, The Bourne Identity), it would be ludicrous to describe this as his moment. Even in his relatively small roles – as the disapproving headmaster in Rushmore, say, or the terrifying writing guru in Adaptation – Cox has always dominated the screen. But Logan Roy has caught the public’s imagination in a way that feels new to him.Cox is a Labour supporter who has campaigned for Scottish independence. So he wasn’t wildly impressed with the results of last month’s election. “Ach! The Brits are so feudal. They don’t listen to a civil servant like Jeremy Corbyn, but they will listen to a windbag Tory like Johnson. And my country has suffered for it,” he says.I have heard that Cox is a fan of cannabis so I ask if that helps him cope with the political situation in the US and UK. There is a long pause and I worry I’ve overstepped a line.“It’s absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone – get stoned!” he says with deep feeling. “It does make the politics easier to bear. It’s a way of dealing with idiocy.”Has he always been a stoner? “I didn’t start until I was 50,” he says. “I was very against it, actually. You know, I got married at 21 to an upper-middle-class English girl – well, with Scots parentage, but you know English Scots are the most English! Hahaha! We had two children, one went to St Paul’s, one went to Cheltenham Ladies College. It was all done proper. It wasn’t who I was, but happy wife, happy life. Then when I was 50, I realised I missed out on what was going on with young people because I was so square, and I was working so hard, I needed something to relax. So I discovered the wonderful world of cannabis.”There have been inevitable comparisons between Logan Roy and Rupert Murdoch, despite Cox’s denials (“Rupert Murdoch has fuck all to do with it, and you can quote me on that,” he barked at the Golden Globes). But it must be strange for him, having played a media tycoon now for two seasons, to see the ongoing dominance of Fox News in the US, or to watch Michael Bloomberg’s bid for the presidency.“Yeah, it’s interesting. All these guys, whether they’re liberal or the opposite, they see themselves as leaders. And they all have their own problems – clearly, because we’re suffering because of their problems! We’ve suffered under the hands of the Murdoch press and Conrad Black and now Donald Trump.”And yet despite the show depicting how extreme wealth corrupts extremely, it has accrued fans among that demographic. Cox was recently in a cafe in Primrose Hill, north London, when he was approached by a man who told him that he and his wife liked Succession, “but she found it a little hard to watch sometimes”.“Who’s your wife?” asked Cox. “Elisabeth Murdoch,” he replied. “Can you go a bit easier on her next season?”So I’m guessing he’s not a fan of The Crown, I say. There’s another pause. “I love it!” he says, and makes a loud guilty laugh. “I resisted it for ever and a day and then I started to watch it and it was like heroin. I was completely hooked – and that’s how they get you.”Jesse Armstrong wove some of Cox’s biography into Logan’s, making the character a native of Dundee and even shooting some scenes in Cox’s hometown. Like Logan, Cox has a daughter and three sons from two marriages and, also like his alter ego, his childhood was unimaginably different from the one he was able to give his kids.Cox was born and raised in Dundee, the youngest of five children of a butcher and a spinner. The family was always poor but when Cox was eight their situation worsened immeasurably after his father died from cancer. Soon after, his mother had a severe nervous breakdown and was given electric shock treatment. From the age of 10, Cox was largely raised by his sisters and on some nights, there was so little food in the house he would go to the local chippie and beg for battered scraps.“People who don’t know poverty haven’t lived, quite frankly. You know everything is conditional,” he says. To this day, he has a bigger wardrobe than his wife because he is a terrible hoarder – after growing up with nothing, he can’t bear to give anything away.Cox stumbled through school, leaving at 15 with no qualifications. He worked as a stage manager (“Worst stage manager ever – I always left the iron on”) before going to Lamda to study acting.I ask what he thinks about the arguments over whether British acting is too dominated by posh people and he jumps in before I finish.“You can’t blame Damian Lewis or Eddie Redmayne or whatsisname, er, Benedict Cumberpast, er, Cumberpat, no, Cumberbatch – that’s it,” he says. “You know, talent is talent and one has to be careful about not being mean. But it says something about our creative work that we haven’t got an even playing field. Egalitarian thinking is completely lacking in the UK,” he says.This lack of egalitarianism sparks another thought. There is a brief cheeky “Shall I tell this or not? Yes, I shall” hesitation.“You know, when I was a young actor I was touched up by Princess Margaret,” he says.Brian, I am going to need more details on this.“I was at the Royal Court. I was doing a play with Alan Bates and it was my 23rd birthday and I’d been given a red shirt from Lindsay Anderson. I’d just washed my hair so I was sort of glistening, heh heh heh, and I walked in and was introduced to her. She put her fingers on my shirt, and said: ‘This is a lovely shirt.’ And she started to run her fingers down the inside of my shirt. And I went: Uh oh! What do you do when you’re being touched up by a royal?”What do you do?“It was so funny. James Bolam, he could see what was going on and started going ‘Ooooh’ out of the side of his mouth, which somehow said princess didn’t take in at all. She just kept saying: ‘You were so wonderfully hooded on stage. I wanted to know more about you …’ She was an extraordinay creature. I excused myself and said: ‘Thank you, ma’am,’ and it came to a natural end.”What an amazing man Cox is, working his way up from begging for scraps in Dundee to the absolute top of the Hollywood tree ( “I know, I must write my memoir”). Even his Brooklyn apartment is so smart that the New York Times once did a whole article about it. This included the memorable detail that he and his wife have separate bedrooms and a studio that they “tryst in”. Is this true? He has a shag room?“Yeah! We do. The problem is in New York City it’s bloody hard to find the space. But it’s basically her room and I’m allowed to visit occasionally, heh heh heh,” he cackles in a manner that is, undeniably, deliciously, Logan Roy-ish.Succession will return to Sky and NOW TV in 2020 and is available on Sky Store now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a9e08bca4aeb4c27ec1b04b82c241563f462840/0_54_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da7a8f9fd18523cfc963490ffbfce734","title":"libya talks moscow diplomatic coup vladimir putin","story":"Summit brings together two sides in civil war and confirms Russia’s increasing influenceVladimir Putin has pulled off a significant diplomatic coup by arranging a mini-summit in Moscow between the two sides in Libya’s long-running civil war.It is not clear whether Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the Libyan National Army forces in the east, and Fayez al-Sarraj, the leader of the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, will meet, but the presence of the two sides in the Russian capital is a confirmation of Russia’s increasingly important role in Libya.Divided European countries have failed to bring about an end to an increasingly bloody nine-month assault on Tripoli by Haftar.The two leaders and their delegations are due to sign a truce deal, consolidating an agreement the two men separately made for a ceasefire over the weekend.The ceasefire, demanded jointly by Moscow and Turkey last week, came into force on Sunday, but was sporadically broken.Sarraj had previously demanded that Haftar’s troops withdraw to their positions before the start of their April offensive. A ceasefire is seen as a necessary precursor to wider talks. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, will also be present at the Moscow meeting.If the two Libyan antagonists met face to face it would not be for the first time, but it would be the first direct meeting since Haftar launched his attack on Tripoli, which has been denounced by Sarraj as a war crime.The two men have previously met face to face in Abu Dhabi and in Paris to sign various peace agreements that have then fallen apart.Only last week Sarraj refused to go ahead with a planned meeting in Rome with the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, after he learned that Conte was also meeting Haftar. Sarraj finally went ahead with the Rome meeting on Saturday, but without Haftar.Russia has increased its leverage in Libya by allowing a small number of Russian mercenaries tied to the private Wagner Group to operate near Tripoli on behalf of Haftar. Putin insists if any Russian troops are operating they do not have his sanction.The diplomatic jockeying between Europe, Turkey and Russia over Libya is significant since the country credited with finally bringing peace to Libya is likely to benefit in terms of diplomatic prestige and even future contracts.Although Libya and Syria are very different cases, there are some parallels with the way an uneasy alliance of Turkey, Russia and Iran grabbed hold of the political negotiations in Syria, wresting the initiative from the US, Europe and the UN.It is not yet clear if Putin is trying to push Europe out of the peacemaking process, or is willing to work in conjunction with European nations.Putin met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, at the weekend in Russia. Berlin has been due to hold a peace conference with the main interested parties and the array of external actors. Germany announced the much-delayed conference will be held on January 19 in Berlin, in a further sign of diplomatic momentum. The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has already said he will attend, along with Conte and Putin.Italy, once seen as the pre-eminent decision-maker in Libya, has been trying to recover lost ground by proposing a trilateral peace process with Russia and Turkey. Conte has come under ferocious domestic criticism for mishandling the crisis, and for being seen as irrelevant. He is due to meet Erdoğan on Monday.Separately the new European commission has been seeking to take a more active role.The EU council president, Charles Michel, on Sunday went to Cairo to talk to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, one of the strongest backers of Haftar. The new commission, anxious that the US is pulling back in the Middle East, is desperate not to leave a western void filled by Turkey and Russia.Turkey appears to have bought itself some leverage in the future of Libya talks by announcing it is prepared to send troops there to help up prop up Sarraj’s Government of National Accord (GNA).Military figures in the GNA claim as many as 500 Russian mercenaries have been operating in southern Tripoli, and there were signs that they were being pulled back from the frontlines at the weekend.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Putin on Monday to tell him he supported a ceasefire that was “credible, durable and verifiable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f792b76454343c81291979ce31234ab8e30bffab/0_150_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352fe08390070b87b8a630a118a379cc","title":"philippines lava gushes from taal volcano as alert level raised","story":"Scientists warn ‘hazardous eruption’ imminent as offices, schools and airports closedLava has gushed out of a volcano in the Philippines after a sudden eruption of ash and steam that forced villagers to flee and shut down the country’s main airport, offices and schools.Clouds of ash were blown more than 62 miles (100km) north of the Taal volcano, reaching the bustling capital, Manila, and forcing the the main international airport to close and cancel more than 500 flights.There have been no reports of casualties or major damage from the eruption that began on Sunday.Police said more than 13,000 villagers had been moved to evacuation centres in the hard-hit province of Batangas and nearby Cavite, but officials expect the number to swell with hundreds of thousands more being brought to safety.The evacuation numbers are likely to be higher as local authorities help displaced people before notifying the national agency that is collating the figures. Some residents could not move out of ash-blanketed villages because of a lack of transport and poor visibility, while others are refusing to leave their homes and farms.“We have a problem, our people are panicking due to the volcano because they want to save their livelihood, their pigs and herds of cows,” Wilson Maralit, the mayor of Balete town, told DZMM radio. “Were trying to stop them from returning and warning that the volcano can explode again any time and hit them.”Maralit, whose town lies along the shoreline of Taal Lake, which surrounds the erupting volcano, appealed for troops and additional police to be deployed to stop residents from sneaking back into high-risk areas.Several planes stranded at the Manila airport might be allowed to take off on Monday once they were cleaned of ash and authorities were sure an easterly shift in ash-laden wind away from the capital would not revert, the airport general manager, Ed Monreal, told a news conference. The airport could not accommodate incoming flights until stranded aircraft had flown out and freed up parking bays, he said.The aircraft of the president, Rodrigo Duterte, was able to land on Monday after his flight, from his southern Davao city hometown, was delayed on Sunday by the volcanic eruption, his spokesman said.Taal had been restive for months until it suddenly rumbled back to life on Sunday, blasting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the sky, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Lava spurting from the volcano’s vents on Monday was falling into the lake surrounding the crater.The government volcano-monitoring agency raised the danger level around Taal three notches to level 4, indicating an imminent hazardous eruption. Level 5, the highest, means a hazardous eruption is under way and could affect a larger area with high-risk zones that would need to be cleared of people, said Renato Solidum, who heads the institute. María Antonia Bornas, the agency’s chief volcanologist, said Taal spurted fountains of lava early on Monday while its ash and steam ejections slightly eased. “It’s hard to tell when the eruption would stop,” she said, citing the volcano’s similar restiveness in the 1970s that lasted for about four months.With the ashfall easing on Monday, some residents began to shovel away ash that covered everything from homes to cars and roads in Tagaytay, a popular upland resort city on a ridge that overlooks the small but picturesque volcano. Many of the city’s restaurants and coffee shops, however, were closed.The volcanology institute reminded the public that the small island where the volcano lay was a permanent danger zone, although fishing villages had existed there for years. Authorities continued to detect swarms of earthquakes and the slight inflation of portions of the volcano, officials said, advising residents to stay indoors and to wear masks and goggles if they had to go outside.Public institutions, including schools, in many towns and cities were suspended on Monday, including in Manila, to avoid health risks posed by the ashfall. At least four Batangas towns reported power outages.Taal, one of the world’s smallest volcanoes, is among two dozen active volcanoes in the Philippines and lies along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Laneway was allegedly potholed and \u0026lsquopatched\u0026rsquo, court toldVaradkar to meet Johnson to mark resurrection of ExecutiveFollow our live updates as storm moves across Ireland with orange warnings in placeFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says Taoiseach \u0026lsquosaid to us that he wasn\u0026rsquot sure of some of his own people\u0026rsquoLynn alleged to have stolen almost \u0026euro30m from Irish financial institutionsLongford-Westmeath TD says he will be standing as outright independent for electionPlan to mark 150th anniversary cancelled over fears of debate concerning UK apologyCombination of spring tide and storm surge poses risk of structural damageAirbnb has become a \u0026lsquofree-for-all\u0026rsquo says councillorDoherty families, who have been on the site at Balgaddy, Clondalkin since late 2018, have been ordered by the High Court to leave by January 15thMichael Ring says movement \u0026lsquois a good thing for community life in Ireland\u0026rsquoVulnerable minors are not getting timely access to therapuetic care, report says\u0026lsquoIt was ... startling to feel the level of public support,\u0026rsquo says Mr Justice John MacMenaminTown in Co May has seen an increase in tourists since inclusion on Wild Atlantic WayCase centres on issue whether Minister has duty to consider consequences of deportationTwo Irish companies, BleeperBike and Moby, will be licensed to hire out \u0026lsquopedelecs\u0026rsquoDublin area \u0026lsquosorely needs\u0026rsquo safer cycling routes, hospital chiefs saySeveral routes set to cross College Green and would be in conflict with council\u0026rsquos initiativePrevious request from council for civic space appealed by Dublin Bus as \u0026lsquosocially regressive\u0026rsquoFormal complaint alleges two patients have died and another had \u0026lsquonear miss\u0026rsquo since the consultant took up a HSE post earlier this year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137687.1578865715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all the focus in politics now on the first fortnight in february","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar slowly shifted his language from the previous strict adherence to his line that polling day should fall in May to saying he would call an election when it was the right time for the country. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe 32nd Dáil will have lasted almost four years by the time of the general election, a much longer period than most believed when the last election threw up its inconclusive result on February 26th, 2016. After those years of uncertainty, they now know an election will be held within weeks.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made his call and, while not being definitive, clearly indicated on RTÉ’s This Week that he will dissolve the Dáil in the coming days for an early February general election. The signs that Varadkar was moving in this direction were evident since before Christmas, when he began to carve out the space to allow himself to go to the country earlier than his previous suggested date of May 2020. He slowly shifted his language from the previous strict adherence to his line that polling day should fall in May to saying he would call an election when it was the right time for the country. He then asked the impossible of Micheál Martin, asking that the Fianna Fáil leader should get his TDs to actually vote with the Government rather than abstain, as outlined in the confidence and supply agreement. Knowing his Fine Gael-minority government was on its last legs due to dwindling Dáil numbers, he prepared the ground for the announcement he is expected to make this week. UncertaintyPerhaps the Taoiseach was content to allow events of recent days – with Independent TDs shying away from supporting him and general uncertainty building momentum towards an election – play out. The past week has brought Varadkar to the destination he had likely settled on weeks ago: a general election campaign he hopes will be bookended by Brexit, what he on Sunday called “the big job of this Government”.He will travel to Belfast on Monday to meet British prime minister Boris Johnson, and Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, is in Dublin on Wednesday. If Varadkar opts for a February 7th election date, the UK will leave the EU one week out from polling day, and the issue will feature heavily in the final week of the campaign, when many voters make up their minds. On the issue of hospital beds, he said Fine Gael had “reversed” the cuts in health implemented by Fianna Fáil between 2007 and 2011, and added that he had worked with Brendan Howlin in the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of 2011-2016 to increase investment. His interview also prompted action across political parties and among Independent TDs and candidates. Many TDs had already begun a heavy canvass schedule, but others had held back. Considering their futureDecisions on whether to actually run at all will also be made by others in the coming days, with two members of the Independent Alliance considering their future.Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath is understood to be consulting his family and local organisation on whether he will stand again in Dublin Bay North, with sources close to the political veteran saying he is “50-50”. Minister of State for Skills John Halligan is also said to be considering whether to retire from political life and not seek to hold on to his Waterford seat.Fianna Fáil is expected to make a few further ticket changes this week, such as the addition of a candidate in Cork North Central, and the party announced that Dara Calleary, its deputy leader, will be director of elections. Fine Gael’s executive council will also add more candidates in some constituencies as all political focus now turns to the first fortnight in February."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138031.1578925149!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm brendan 140km h winds batter coast of west cork","story":"The scene from Bantry and the M7 - with a roaming trampoline - as more than 48,000 customers have been hit by power outages from Storm Brendan.

Photograph: Michael Finnan via Twitter More than 48,000 homes and businesses are without power on Monday as powerful winds from Storm Brendan sweep eastwards over Ireland .Power outages have been reported in counties Mayo, Roscommon, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Laois, Kilkenny, Meath and Monaghan with further outages expected on the east coast as the storm makes its way across the country. Winds are now starting to ease along the west coast although a second belt of strong winds is forecast in the west this evening. Storm Brendan made landfall on Monday morning bringing gusts of almost 100kmh over northeast counties and more than 140kmh off the coast of west Cork. A status orange weather alert is in place nationwide until this evening as high winds and heavy rain batter the country. The powerful winds have brought down trees and blown debris onto roads making road conditions difficult and a number of trampolines have been blown onto motorways. Power cuts More than 48,000 homes and businesses, mostly in counties Kerry, Galway, Limerick, Donegal and Mayo, are without power with ESB networks crews being dispatched to assess the damage and restore power.ESB urged members of the public not to approach or touch fallen trees, wires or damaged electricity networks as they may be live and extremely dangerous.More power cuts are expected as Storm Brendan moves eastwards.  Real time information on power outages and restoration times is available on the PowerCheck App or www.esb.ieesb-networkspowercheckTransport Motorists and road users are being advised to exercise caution due to debris on roads while cyclists are being advised to avoid unnecessary journeys while the orange wind warning is in place. Three trampolines have been blown onto motorways on Monday, two on the the M7, near the University of Limerick, and near Oola in Co Tipperary and near Junction 9 on the M9. These have since been cleared. AA Roadwatch has reported a number of fallen trees across the country and blocking roads in Dublin, Kerry, Cork, Tipperary, Offaly, Wexford, Carlow, Kildare, Meath, Cavan and Donegal. Irish Ferries had not cancelled any Dublin-Holyhead crossing by 2pm, however the Dublin to Holyhead 2.30pm sailing was delayed due to adverse weather conditions. In Cork, the cross river ferry service was suspended due to high winds while passengers travelling in the CobhPassage West area were advised to allow for extra time in their journeys. In West Cork, both the Cape Clear and Sherkin Island ferries were cancelled with winds hitting gale force eight and nine. In Mayo the BelmulletBlacksod Road (R313) was closed from 10am on Monday. Gardaí at Anglesea Street station in Cork city urged people to avoid travelling if possible following reports of 20 fallen trees around the county. Despite heavy rain, there were few reports of flooding across Cork.The Dursey Cable Car at the top of the Beara Peninsula has also been closed.Cork Airport reported no major impact from the storm with all scheduled departures leaving on time while Dublin Airport said all airlines had indicated they would carry out a normal schedule.However, Shannon Airport reported a number of cancellations including flights to and from Birmingham and London Heathrow while flights from Manchester and London Stansted were erted to Cork. The 16.10 Ryanair flight to Wroclaw has been delayed.National director of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Sean Hogan told RTÉ that road conditions on Monday would be very dangerous with fallen power lines and trees expected. Flooding While high tide in Galway passed without any significant flooding Galway City Council advised the public to exercise extreme caution in shore areas and to follow the Coastguard advice to “stay high, stay back, stay safe”.Sections of the sea front at Salthill promenade have been closed and an enforced boom at Spanish Arch was “very effective”, he said.The Irish Coast Guard has advised the public to stay away from exposed beaches, cliffs, piers, promenades and harbours. “Breaking waves along the coast can be unpredictable and quickly drag you away,” it said.The National Parks and Wildlife Services (NPWS) advised the public not to visit any national parks, particularly Killarney National Park, as well as national monuments or nature reserves while warnings are in place. In Dublin flood defences had been erected while the car parks at Clontarf and Sandymount are closed. It is expected the car parks will reopen later in the afternoon.Weather warnings Monday’s orange warning for Connacht, Donegal and Kerry will remain in force until 9pm while the warning for Leinster, Cavan, Monaghan, Clare, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford will be in place between 8am and 3pm.Winds over Fastnet Lighthouse, about 13km off West Cork, averaged at 120kmh on Monday morning with gusts reaching 148 kmh.A status red marine warning has also been issued.Irish Water supply and service updates - 1850-278278Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137683.1578864431!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 varadkar and martin flex political muscle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar: ‘Over the next five years we can look forward to building a much better country.’ Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMr Varadkar is set to seek a dissolution of the 32nd Dáil this week.He indicated heavily on Sunday that he will call an election in the coming days because the tight Dáil arithmetic had meant “circumstances had changed” since he previously stated he wanted to go to the polls in May.“I’ll end any uncertainty as soon as I can,” Mr Varadkar told RTÉ’s This Week, before adding that, as it stands, the Cabinet will meet on Tuesday and the Dáil will reconvene on Wednesday after the Christmas recess. Internal Fine Gael speculation suggests an election date of Friday, February 7th, although the following Friday, February 14th, is also mentioned. Mr Varadkar, however, has not given indications on his exact plans. Political speculation also suggested he could seek a dissolution of the Dáil from President Michael D Higgins on Wednesday or Thursday.Mr Varadkar will meet British prime minister Boris Johnson in Belfast on Monday, where the pair are expected to discuss the restored Stormont institutions, British-Irish relations and the future trading relationship. He will also meet First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyenwill be in Dublin on Wednesday.The Taoiseach sought to portray Fine Gael as the party best placed to continue economic growth and handle the next phase of the Brexit negotiations.“Over the next five years we can look forward to building a much better country, one where we can invest more in infrastructure, housing, healthcare, one where we can invest in public services, one where we can reduce taxes and put more money back in people’s pockets,” said Mr Varadkar. “That is now all possible. But it is only possible if it is managed well and the public finances are managed well and we are the people who are best placed to do that, not the people who failed to do it in the past.” ‘Dream of home ownership’Mr Martin told The  there will be “an avalanche of Fine Gael spin” over the coming weeks.“But some core facts cannot be spun and will form the foundation of this election,” he said. “A whole generation of people have seen the dream of home ownership slip away. And all across the country families are simply terrified at the prospect of their loved ones having to be admitted to hospital because of the record numbers of people on trolleys and the lack of support for those working on the front line.”In a sign of sparring likely to feature in the campaign, a Government Minister described some members of the Green Party as “nutters”.Minister of State for Local Government John Paul Phelan made the comments in a speech at an IFA dinner in his native Kilkenny on Saturday night.According to one source present, Mr Phelan said: “There are lots of good people in the Green Party, but some are nutters.”In response, Green Party Dublin Rathdown TD Catherine Martin said: “That is language unbecoming of a Minister. If that is the type of campaign that is going to be run by Fine Gael, then I don’t think the electorate will thank them for it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137491.1578906482!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ex british pm john major shelved famine commemoration","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Starving peasants in 1846 clamour at the gates of a workhouse during the Irish potato famine.

File photograph: Tom HonanThe .Former British prime minister John Major stepped in to stop plans for a service commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Irish Famine in 1996 amid fears it would ignite debate about a UK apology for its role.Discussions were ongoing between the Northern Ireland Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office about holding an ecumenical service in Liverpool during a visit by then president Mary Robinson in June 1996. The church service would also have been attended by a senior member of the royal family as well as Mr Major.Despite backing by then secretary of state for Northern Ireland Patrick Mayhew, the plan was mothballed by the prime minister and his private secretary, citing fears of what the reaction would be from nationalist and unionist communities.The exchange of ideas is shown in correspondence released by the National Archives in London as part of the annual release of historical state papers. The debate about the commemoration came shortly after the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire.“The prime minister is very dubious about taking this proposal forward, and not only in the present climate. Whatever we say, government (and arguably royal) attendance at such a service would look like an apology for the famine and revive debate about whether we owe such an apology,” said Mr Major’s private secretary Edward Oakden in a letter to a colleague at the foreign office.“Is it sensible to be doing this at any time, and especially during President Robinson’s visit to which it would introduce controversy? The Unionists are unlikely to sympathise and Nationalist appetites seem more likely to be whetted than allayed. The prime minister would rather therefore that the proposal were not for the moment pursued. He would certainly not plan to attend himself.”What was said in private?Mr Oakden had been much more scathing of the idea in private, describing the reasons for it as “loony” in a memo to Mr Major.“Whatever we say, such a service, never mind your attendance at it, would look like an apology. These events happened 150 years ago. They are history. This is not equivalent to the Taoiseach’s attendance at the War Memorial on VE Day. The Unionist reaction can be imagined. And it would not satisfy the Nationalists. More likely, it would revive arguments about whether the UK should apologise, and add controversy to President Robinson’s visit,” he wrote.Mrs Robinson was invited to Britain on an official visit by Mr Major, and had lunch with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Edward, preceded by an inspection of the guard of honour at Buckingham Palace.Despite potato blight being considered the immediate cause of the famine which killed more than a million people and led millions to emigrate in the 1840s, the inadequacy of the British government’s response and export of Irish-grown food continue to be a matter of controversy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138086.1578909955!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kevin boxer moran to leave independent alliance","story":"Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW) has announced he is leaving the Independent Alliance.In an interview with Shannonside Radio on Monday the Longford-Westmeath TD said he will be standing in the next election as an outright Independent, rather than under the banner of the Independent Alliance.Mr Moran said if he is re-elected he may join a new political grouping in the new Dáil.The Independent Alliance was set up principally by Minister for Transport Shane Ross before the last election and was Fine Gael’s main coalition partner for the last four years.It currently has four Ministers: Mr Ross, Mr Moran, Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath and Minister of State for Skills John Halligan.Mr McGrath is considering whether to stand again in Dublin Bay North but is expected to do so, while Mr Halligan is expected to announce later this week that he will not seek re-election in his Waterford constituency.It effectively means the Independent Alliance has come to an end."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138010.1578922226!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands flee as lava spews from philippines volcano","story":"The Taal volcano began to erupt overnight with clouds of ash and steam eminating from the site. All flights were suspended from Manila airport, as authorities scrambled to evacuate nearby villagers. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAsh and steam spews into the air, a day after the eruption of Taal Volcano, in Agoncillo town in Batangas province, Philippines. Photograph: Rolex Dela PenaEPARed-hot lava has gushed out of a volcano near the Philippine capital as tens of thousands of people fled the area through heavy ash and frightening tremors.Experts warned that the eruption could get worse and plans are being made to evacuate hundreds of thousands more.Clouds of ash blew more than 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of the Taal volcano on Sunday, reaching Manila, the bustling capital, and forcing the closure of the country’s main airport, with more than 500 flights cancelled.The airport was partially reopened on Monday after the ashfall eased.There have been no reports of casualties or major damage so far.A truck, however, skidded out of control and fell on its side on an ash-blanketed road, killing the driver and injuring three companions in southern Laguna province in an accident police said may be linked to the slippery road conditions.The government’s disaster response agency and other officials reported more than 30,000 villagers have fled their homes in the hard-hit province of Batangas and nearby Cavite province, but officials expect the number to swell with hundreds of thousands more moving out of harm’s way.Ash-blanketed villagesSome residents could not move out of ash-blanketed villages immediately due to a lack of transport and poor visibility.Others refused to leave their homes and farms.“We have a problem — our people are panicking due to the volcano because they want to save their livelihood, their pigs and herds of cows,” mayor Wilson Maralit, of Balete town, told DZMM radio.“We’re trying to stop them from returning and warning that the volcano can explode again anytime and hit them.”Maralit, whose town lies along the shoreline of Taal Lake surrounding the erupting volcano, appealed for troops and more policemen to stop distraught residents from sneaking back to their high-risk villages.After a clean-up and ash-laden winds shifted away from Manila, officials partially reopened the main airport and allowed stranded planes to take off on Monday.Airport manager Ed Monreal told a news conference that incoming flights can be accommodated once parking bays are freed up, but warned that the airport may be closed again if the danger returns.President Rodrigo Duterte’s aircraft was able to land in Manila on Monday from his southern home city Davao, his spokesman said, adding he saw the extent of the volcanic devastation from the plane.Lava fountainsTaal had been restive for months until it suddenly rumbled back to life on Sunday, blasting steam, ash and pebbles up to 10 to 15 kilometres (six to nine miles) into the sky, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.The ash and steam column reached a height of only two kilometres (about a mile) on Monday, with lava fountains spurting less than half of that height before falling into lake waters surrounding the main crater.Lava also spurted from another vent north of the main crater, Renato Solidum, who heads the institute, told reporters.Frequent tremors and inflation of the 1,020ft (311-metre) volcano, one of the world’s smallest, indicate a major and much more dangerous eruption could still happen, he said.The government volcano-monitoring agency raised the danger level around Taal three notches on Sunday, to level 4, indicating “a hazardous eruption within hours to days was possible”.Level 5, the highest, means such an eruption is under way and could affect a larger area with high-risk zones that would need to be cleared of people, Mr Solidum said.It is difficult to say when Taal’s restiveness will ease, Mr Solidum said, adding that the volcano’s last disastrous explosion occurred in 1965, when more than 200 people were killed.Uncertain futureLarge numbers of displaced villagers worried about the homes, farms and cattle they left behind and the uncertain future they face.A small island where the volcano lies has long been declared a “permanent danger zone”, although fishing villages have existed there for years.Those residents have all been evacuated safely, volcanology officials said, adding that there should be a “total evacuation” too of lakeshore communities “at high risk to pyroclastic density currents and volcanic tsunami within a 14-kilometre (8.7-mile) radius from Taal”.Government work and classes in schools in a wide swathe of towns and cities were suspended on Monday, including in Manila, to avoid health risks posed by the ashfall.Taal is regarded as the second-most restive of about two dozen active volcanoes in the Philippines, which lies along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a seismically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.A long-dormant volcano, Mount Pinatubo, erupted north of Manila in 1991 in one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century, killing hundreds of people.About 20 typhoons and other major storms each year also batter the Philippines, which lies between the Pacific and the South China Sea, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.–

Commonwealth Day service last March. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPI never had much use for the queen. Maybe it’s the Irish in me. As Winston Churchill said: “We’ve always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English.” Or maybe it’s the American in me. We did go to an awful lot of trouble to break away from that corgi-and-gin-loving racket 244 years ago. At some visceral level, though, America must regret being torn away from the royal family. How else to explain our enduring fascination with dynasties? Having spent my career covering four dysfunctional political dynasties, I rebel more than ever at the idea that biology entitles you to authority.The ghost of Diana gone rogue animates the fractured fairy tale of Meghan and Harry, and their intemperate attempt to upend centuries of starchy rules and break away from the Firm. Princess Di’s dangerous tango with the tabloids left Harry with no taste to play that game again, especially with streaks of racism against Markle added to the mix. He recently confessed that every click or flash of a camera brought memories of his mother’s death racing back into his mind.US visitI covered Diana’s first trip as the Princess of Wales to America in 1985. She seemed happy then, in that year before Charles resumed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. She and the prince shared amused eye contact, winks and teasing remarks.Nancy Reagan planned an evening of candlelit dancing at the White House worthy of a 24-year-old Cinderella in a midnight blue velvet gown. The first lady arranged for the Marine Band to play Night Fever as John Travolta spun a euphoric Diana around the floor. (“She’s a great little mover,” he said afterwards.)I wondered how Prince Charles would deal with a young wife with so much star power, absorbing so much attention. We were all mesmerised when she tucked her chin down in that shy pose and cast that modest yet saucy look up at us. The answer was: he did not deal with it well. Twelve years later, when the unimaginable tragedy hit, the royal ice cubes were furious at the expectation that they should emote for the woman who had publicly ripped the monarchy as a bloodless, soulless gang and christened herself the Prisoner of Wales.The Firm was out of its depth then, and it is again now. How can the queen and Prince Philip and Prince Charles possibly understand the desire of Meghan and Harry to rebrand as a Goopish lifestyle enterprise? The news that they have applied to trademark hundreds of items, from socks to hoodies, under the “Sussex Royal” logo makes Wallis Simpson’s exile in the Bahamas, spent matching the colour on the walls to her face powder, seem positively monastic.Can you really call yourself “financially independent” when all you’re doing is cashing in on the royal name? Given the state of the world and the implosion of the British empire – with Scots once more contemplating an off ramp, Irish unity in play, Australia on fire and Boris Johnson tricking the queen into suspending parliament in a Brexit ploy – it is hard to feel sorry for the Duchess of Sussex complaining that her diamonds are heavy. The pathos for Markle, trapped in a designer cage, goes only so far.It’s easy for royals to come to North America, where they are lavishly embraced as celebrities without all those pesky restrictions about class and role. (See The Crown episode about a wild, imbibing Princess Margaret charming LBJ.) Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed – in Buckingham Palace. She could have channelled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America.Markle had already successfully brought a refreshing dose of semi-radical chic to the royal family. Her visits to a mosque that housed Londoners displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire led to her putting out a 2018 cookbook, the proceeds of which went to the victims.Irish visitAt its best, the monarchy has been able to lift up people, as it did during the blitz in the second World War. I saw that ability to alchemise emotions and opinions when I covered the queen on her visit to Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. It was impossible not to be impressed watching her speak Irish and offering regret about how Britain had made Ireland suffer, bowing her head at the scene of Bloody Sunday and the Garden of Remembrance, the sacred ground for slain Irish patriots.The Irish started out sceptical, but by the end of her visit, many were calling her “Betty” on Twitter. The queen of England holds out the idea that she and her family should have some sort of vestigial moral authority. But with the Prince Andrew imbroglio in the seraglio of Jeffrey Epstein, and with Harry’s run for the Hollywood Hills, it is clear that many in her family are not interested in moral authority.The collapse of the authority of the British monarchy mirrors the collapse of authorities generally, scarred by years of scandals about clergymen abusing children, athletes beating up girlfriends and university officials accepting bribes. And yet, even if the royals’ role in the culture is now akin to the Kardashians, it wasn’t cool for Meghan and Harry to pants the 93-year-old queen, defy her instructions, dump their Megxit plan on Instagram and intensify the sad split between the brothers.

His home had been flattened in the massive earthquake which hit Haiti ten years ago on Sunday, killing over 300,000 people. He heard word that there was space to live up in the hills, in an area on the outskirts of Port au Prince known as Canaan.And so he collected the remnants of his life in the impoverished Delmas 4 district, and moved up into the hills with his family.“But there was nothing here,” he recalls. “We arrived, and there was no one from the government. So we just asked around to find a free spot, and called it our own. We just had to guess how big an area we could claim.”The 7.0 magnitude earthquake that rocked Haiti 10 years ago wiped out almost a fifth of government employees, and left 1.5 million homeless.Cholera broke out, introduced to the country by UN peacekeepers, which killed 10,000 people and infected 800,000 more.Aid money poured into the Caribbean nation, and Bill Clinton – who spent his 1975 honeymoon with Hillary in Haiti – was made co-chair of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC). Sean Penn became the unofficial mayor of a homeless camp Oprah Winfrey and Kim Kardashian jetted in to see for themselves.The fallout from the 2010 earthquake continues todayTen years later, Haitians shake their heads sadly and wonder where it all went wrong.There was so much energy, attention, and money - $13 billion (£10bn) promised in the years 2010-20, of which half was actually distributed. An additional $3 billion was contributed to UN agencies and NGOs by private donors, meaning that the $9 billion in aid was three times the revenue of the government of Haiti between 2010 and 2012.Yet 35,000 people still live in temporary accommodation, according to the International Organisation of Migration. In reality the figure is likely to be significantly higher, as people are classed as being housed even when living in a shack  Canaan is still home to around 200,000 people, who still don’t have running water or electricity.“They wanted us to move here, but they didn’t help us,” said Mr Appolos, 52, with a shrug.He founded a school in the new community, built from plywood and corrugated iron, and funded entirely from donations made by Haitians living in the area. Now 300 students attend his tiny make-shift study centre.Half-built houses litter the hillsides many began building, but run out of money to complete it. A small one-room breezeblock building would cost around $1,000 to make, he estimated.Haiti was initially flooded with celebrities and goodwill, but much of the promised money has failed to materialise“It’s been very, very hard to find a way to build,” he said. “We had to do it all ourselves.”When the earthquake hit, Enancy Bienaime\u0027s house folded on top of her like it was made of playing cards. For three hours she was trapped in the rubble her desperate cries eventually led neighbours to dig her out. For two years she then lived in a tent – one of thousands pitched on the marshy wastelands on the outskirts of Haiti’s capital, Port au Prince.“Life has only got worse since then,” she said.She showed The  the corrugated iron shed where she now lives with her husband and two children, built on the site of their former home.That house, in Cite Soleil, the largest slum in the northern hemisphere, was built in the 1950s by Voodoo doctor Francois Papa Doc Duvalier, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 15 years. Now it is home to 265,000 people, crammed into an area only eight miles square and without sewers, running water or social services. A fetid, rubbish-filled canal provides the only drainage, and frequently floods into the slums. Pigs wallow in the mud, and squeal inside the ruins which still line the streets.“This house is terrible, even compared to my previous one,” said Mrs Bienaime, 35. “It’s so hot, with the corrugated iron roof. And I know it could topple at any time. I’m constantly frightened.”A man sells ice cream to children in the Carradeux communityThe earthquake and its immense challenges created huge political problems, which have fuelled the rise of gangs across the country. The gangs are paid by political and business interests, to corral votes or control a zone fights for territory are fierce.Cite Soleil is among the most hotly-contested territory for the gangs. “There are nine year olds around here with guns,” said Mrs Bienaime. “My one year old daughter has seen so many shootings she now makes a pistol sign with her fingers, and a ‘pow, pow’ noise. It breaks my heart. I’m desperate to move away from here.”Kwanli Kladstrup, country director for Irish NGO Concern, runs a programme to help reduce the risks of natural disasters, ensure the protection of children, and build sustainable livelihoods. Her team proudly tell how they educate their community about surviving earthquakes and hurricanes, demonstrating hiding under tables, and sheltering in doorways.A woman walks past the ruins of Notre Dame Cathedral during Haiti\u0026#39s 10th earthquake anniversary“There have been some improvements since the earthquake, but the endemic poverty continues to push people to the limit of their coping abilities, and hinder progress,” she said.She points out that hunger is a very real problem. OCHA, the UN humanitarian agency, estimates that four million people will need emergency food rations by March.“We have to focus on increasing investment in sustainable food systems and agriculture, and developing local markets to raise productivity,” she said.Janvier Junior, 33, agreed. Born in the slum, he has never seen things so bad.

Yet all economies are vulnerable to threats to the global trading system. That’s why our manifesto commitments on trade must be a pre-eminent strategic priority for this empowered Conservative government.Our manifesto pledged parallel trade talks with the EU, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, aiming to cover 80 per cent of UK trade with free trade deals in the next three years. This whole-UK, whole-world policy is exactly the right approach and Liz Truss has done brilliantly to secure it.But deep dangers are ahead. By linking access to its markets with demands for regulatory harmonisation, the EU makes itself a global outlier. We need immediately to end the UK’s timid Eurocentrism by negotiating simultaneously with independent, free-trading partners. Accepting the export of EU power would deepen our recent humiliation as we succumbed to be a mere regulatory satellite, unable to join old friends as equal partners.Brexit | The best comment and analysisIn meeting ambassadors and their teams, I have found categorical differences of approach. Our European partners regard our decision to leave the EU with bewilderment. It has been necessary to reassure them that, overwhelmingly, Tory Eurosceptics are free traders with an expansive view of prosperity and our friendship with the world, that we reject technocracy and have faith in the collective wisdom of the people, expressed in the markets for products, services, culture, ideas and public policy.In contrast, our friends in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US are fearless in accepting our commitment to civilised values, impatient in their desire to see us become international equals and, if they are bewildered, it is only because we have been hesitant in reorienting ourselves to the global outlook we have chosen. These old friends outside the EU are those we need most right now.As Woody Johnson, the US Ambassador to London, recently reminded us, America is the world’s largest economy, offering huge potential to our businesses. They are ready to negotiate, they are prioritising us and the window for success is closing as the US heads into presidential elections. That is why this Government must fully commit to parallel trade talks, immediately prioritising the US. The day for action on US trade is the day we leave the EU.A myriad of objections explode into view. Of course, we won’t sell the NHS but we do need to earn the funds to pay for it. Yes, food in the US is good to eat and we must be unafraid to say so. And no, the US is not protectionist but they do wish to avoid importing other countries’ anti-competitive practices. They are right in that: a CEBR report last year showed domestic market distortions are of greater magnitude than international trade distortions.Brexit Schedule 2020 | December transition deadline is key for the poundWhen the EU demands level playing field provisions, we must agree the UK will not distort our markets artificially to secure advantages that ordinary commercial processes should yield. But this cannot mean harmonisation.In a progressive society, improvement comes from trial and error, not perfect foresight. Regulatory competition is essential to discover the best ways to secure the best outcomes for consumers, especially for the poorest, who cannot afford to game the system. We must recognise that neither socialists nor our European Commission friends will choose to accept that approach. They evidently believe in power and exporting it.That’s why our greatest friends are the Americans. They too fundamentally believe in liberty, that pioneering spirit that rises above mere materialism, along with ambition and courage and the hope that a better future is there, not merely to be discovered, but to be created through the energies of an entrepreneurial people seeking tirelessly to serve others for profit and moral sentiment. Our old allies in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan are with us too and we must stride forward together, but none surpass the power of the US to achieve change for good.Boris Johnson has the policy we need. He has the power to deliver it. Let’s boldly start parallel negotiations with the US as we leave the EU.Steve Baker MP is chairman of the European Research GroupThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Can Jessica Jones go a whole year without using anything else?In 2020 I will be pledging to become more conscious of the products I purchase and how they are sourced. Like most of us, I am guilty of buying unsustainable products: I use a lot of toiletries and cosmetic products like perfume, makeup and hair serums. I will try to choose products that are made purely from natural ingredients, and ones which have certifications to support their “natural beauty” claims. Using natural ingredients is crucial in preventing toxic chemicals found in beauty and care products, some of them carcinogenic, from seeping into our environment’s ecosystems and into our bodies.The beauty and personal care industry\u0026nbsphas had immense impacts on the environment but recently, with increased awareness of the issues, measures have been taken to combat these. For example, in June 2018, the UK government’s ban on microbeads came into effect and a ban on cotton buds is set to follow in April 2020.\u0026nbsp11 best plastic-free beauty products that aren\u0027t adding to landfillSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst this is a good start, it is not enough. Microbeads are one small part of a much larger issue: the excessive consumerism of beauty and personal care products leading to vast amounts of wastage and toxic pollution. Other damages include plastic packaging with limited recyclability, the carbon footprint of transporting cosmetic goods, harmful toxins in products that are washed down the drain into marine environments, the water wastage in manufacturing processes, and the use of palm oil.\u0026nbspI want to buy from brands that produce sustainably from the offset, in both interior content as well as their packaging. Companies like Wearth sell glass large glass bottles to dispense bulk-bought or homemade shampoo and conditioner and LUSH offer zero-impact packaging products like shampoo bars which claim\u0026nbspto reduce your carbon footprint: one lorry load of shampoo bars delivers the same amount of hair washes as fifteen lorries of liquid shampoo. I will try to ensure that any plastic or material packaging that I do buy is fully recyclable.Created with Sketch.

I have only recently started to consider what is really in the products I buy and how they affect the environment. I am not used to reading ingredient lists, let alone understanding what most of the chemicals actually are. Finding affordable alternatives (on a student budget!) that do not sacrifice sustainability or quality might prove difficult, especially as there are certain products that I use daily that I love. But homemade alternatives to products like body and lip scrubs, are a good way of saving money, whilst also using more simple and natural ingredients.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem?” Representative Stephen Cohen\u0026nbspasked Mr Muilenburg at one point. “These people’s relatives are not coming back. They’re gone. Your salary is still on.”Mr Muilenburg went pale, noting that the board determines his pay.After the hearings, Mr Muilenburg called Mr Calhoun, then the Boeing chair, and offered to forgo any compensation until the Max had fully returned to service. Speaking at a New York Times conference soon after that, Mr Muilenburg said he decided to give up “tens of millions of dollars” after meeting with families of victims of the crashes.How can I make sure I avoid the Boeing 737 Max?“I felt it was important for me to forgo those bonuses and send a message of responsibility,” he said.Boeing said Mr Calhoun, who starts as chief executive Monday, would receive a base salary of $1.4m (£1m) and be eligible for an annual target bonus of $2.5m (£1.9m), long-term incentive awards worth $7.5m (£5.7m) and restricted stock units worth $10m\u0026nbsp(£7.6m).Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was doing a play with Alan Bates and it was my 23rd birthday and I’d been given a red shirt from Lindsay Anderson. I’d just washed my hair so I was sort of glistening, and I walked in and was introduced to her.“She put her fingers on my shirt, and said: ‘This is a lovely shirt.’ And she started to run her fingers down the inside of my shirt. And I went: ‘Uh oh!’ What do you do when you’re being touched up by a royal?”Created with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

If the ear worm is with you for the rest of the day, my apologies.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe reports of the retailer’s troubles dovetail with some research from Colliers International, a real estate adviser that’s been keeping an eye on Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), a form of bankruptcy that’s proved quite popular with retailers.\u0026nbspThey’ve been used as a means of addressing some of the problems Beales boss Tony Brown identified on the BBC’s Today programme: high rents and the need to close unprofitable stores on long leases to cope with a trading environment mired in an ice age.\u0026nbspBoost for retailers as Carney hints at interest rate cutMost adults think retailers use too much packaging, poll claimsPrimark and Boohoo CEOs top most powerful people in fashion listCreditors, including landlords, are typically presented with a restructuring proposal that includes the closure of some stores together with reduced rents at those that remain. If a majority agree - 75 per cent is required - the minority has to lump it.\u0026nbspThese tend to be a lot harder on smaller landlords, often in the sort of places that Beales calls home, than the big ones that dominate the prime locations in big cities. They are also highly controversial in the property businesses.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspColliers added fuel to that fire. It found that out of 23 retailers that underwent a CVA from 2016 onwards, 13 of them went on to fail. They\u0026nbspended up in administration with the CVA thus serving as little more than “sticking plaster” that delayed the inevitable.\u0026nbspThe problem for landlords is that every time a client forces a rent reduction through a CVA, their other clients start queueing up to demand the same thing, some threatening CVAs of their own.\u0026nbspThere is a more optimistic way of looking at Colliers’ figures. It is that ten businesses came out the other side.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Retailers bemoan high rents, business rates, the inaction of central and local government.\u0026nbspThe root cause of both sides\u0027 problems, however, is the consumer. The trend of cash rich time poor shoppers abandoning bricks in favour of clicks shows no signs of slowing. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Mr\u0026nbspMuilenburg also has stock options that could be worth many millions more.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We thank Dennis for his nearly 35 years of service to the Boeing Company,” the company said in a statement. “Upon his departure, Dennis received the benefits to which he was contractually entitled and he did not receive any severance pay or a 2019 annual bonus.”Boeing’s new chief executive, David Calhoun, will receive a $7m (£5.3m)\u0026nbspbonus if he is able to get the 737 Max, which has been grounded since March, safely flying again.

Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem?” Representative Stephen Cohen\u0026nbspasked Mr Muilenburg at one point. “These people’s relatives are not coming back. They’re gone. Your salary is still on.”Mr Muilenburg went pale, noting that the board determines his pay.After the hearings, Mr Muilenburg called Mr Calhoun, then the Boeing chair, and offered to forgo any compensation until the Max had fully returned to service. Speaking at a New York Times conference soon after that, Mr Muilenburg said he decided to give up “tens of millions of dollars” after meeting with families of victims of the crashes.How can I make sure I avoid the Boeing 737 Max?“I felt it was important for me to forgo those bonuses and send a message of responsibility,” he said.Boeing said Mr Calhoun, who starts as chief executive Monday, would receive a base salary of $1.4m (£1m) and be eligible for an annual target bonus of $2.5m (£1.9m), long-term incentive awards worth $7.5m (£5.7m) and restricted stock units worth $10m\u0026nbsp(£7.6m).Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Official figures on Friday will show whether retail sales recorded a second successive monthly fall drop.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is something we should be open and honest about. Brushing it under the carpet will not get us closer to solving the issue.Brexit campaign had ‘racism at heart’, says Labour leader contender“Unfortunately, calling things how they are has not been a quality which we have come to expect from many in positions of responsibility on these matters. People who should know better are too quick to spout to politically correct mantras and too slow to call out problems in certain communities, hindering our ability to get to the bottom of the issue and leaving many residents and victims feeling like they don’t have a voice.”Continuing to link crime to immigrant communities, he\u0026nbspcriticised people “who say we should be eternally tolerant of bad behaviour, which may be rife in other countries but is not traditionally in ours” and said integration must include “learning English, respecting women and obeying our laws”.Responding to the claims, a spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbspIpswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE) condemned the article as “entirely evidence-free”.They said: “The recent article on the topic of crime in the EADT by the newly elected MP for Ipswich is at best disappointing and at worst an ill judged piece of dogwhistling.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He seems to have rather shot from the hip on this issue and misjudged us without making real effort to understand the town and its communities first.​“The best way to tackle crime is to invest in our communities, courts, the CPS, legal aid, etc,\u0026nbspand not pit communities against each other.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesIn response to criticism, Mr Hunt said he would be meeting with the ISCRE but doubled down on his comments.He told one Twitter user that the claims in his column “align with the views of the vast majority of people I spoke to on the doorsteps during the election campaign” and insisted that “if\u0026nbspthere is an issue with one community and there is evidence of it, then it should be looked into”.In a statement, the MP said his article was “a direct result of the conversations I have had with tens of thousands of Ipswich residents over the past few months”.\u0026nbspHe said: “The number one issue raised with me on the doorstep were concerns about crime and antisocial behaviour, particularly in the town centre.“The vast majority of Ipswich residents I spoke to believe that if it is the case that certain crimes and negative behaviours are disproportionately committed by one community, then this should be looked at and the problem tackled.“The problem shouldn’t be brushed under the carpet. We should not shy away from tackling crimes and bad behaviour if the people responsible happen to come from a certain community.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is critical for long-term growth. If current political and economic uncertainties ease, we could see a gradual revival in activity over the course of the year.”Official figures released on Monday showed that the UK economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.3 per cent in November. However, the downbeat message of the Stenn survey runs counter to the consensus in the City of London which last months expected on average that the UK economy to grow by an anaemic 1.1 per cent in 2020.There was further downbeat news on the UK economy from the retail analysts Springboard, which said there was a 2.5 per cent drop in visitors to Britain’s high streets and shopping centres in December compared with a year earlier.It said the drop reflected the caution and spending restraint of consumers which typifies low consumer confidence that has been ongoing for the last three years, “The reasons why this occurred are varied but reflect the caution and spending restraint of consumers which typifies low consumer confidence that has been ongoing for the last three years,” said Diane Wehrle, Springboard’s marketing and insights director.She pointed out that the timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday brought festive trading forward, leading to a noticeable decline in footfall over the two weeks leading up to Christmas.Last week a string of downbeat trading updates from major retailers including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, John Lewis and Superdry last week. Official figures on Friday will show whether retail sales recorded a second successive monthly fall drop.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

France, Italy, Germany and other European and Arab powers scrambled to catch up. \u0026nbsp“Until a few weeks ago the Europeans were happy of taking their sweet time,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a North Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank. “Now what we’re seeing is not about concrete peace as about a change of venue and the emergence of Moscow as the superpower that all the actors are happy to speak with.”Created with Sketch.Protests against Turkey sending forces to Libya Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman brandishing a rifle takes part in a demonstration held by Libyans and Syrians in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi to protest against Turkey\u0027s prospective military interventionTurkish members of parliament vote to send Turkish troops to Libya.

Both western Libyan forces rallied and prevented him from entering the capital.\u0026nbspTurkey, a strong backer of Mr Serraj’s government, in recent weeks began to deploy troops, allied Syrian fighters, and sophisticated military hardware to Libya to counter Mr Haftar’s forces, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\u0026nbspTurkey’s overt intervention and its escalating influence in Libya has prompted alarm in France and among other backers of Haftar, including eastern Mediterranean countries worried about Ankara’s attempts to lay claim to offshore gas reserves.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Sisi, Mr Haftar’s primary backer and mentor, conferred with German chancellor Angela Merkel over Libya.\u0026nbspGermany now says it plans to hold long-planned Libya peace talks in Berlin on 19 January.\u0026nbspItaly, Libya’s former colonial overlord, appeared eager to re-engage in the Libya matter after months of drifting into the orbit of France.\u0026nbspDespite praise for the deal in the Turkish press, experts say the prospects for a lasting piece are dim. Though Mr Serraj and Mr Haftar will both be in Moscow there is no plan for the two men to meet.\u0026nbspMr Serraj commands a measure of loyalty from the powerful armed factions that are pillars of the Government of National Accord but has little control over them. Mr Haftar could be using the peace talks to consolidate gains and buy time to rearm after his recent taking of the central Libyan city of Sirte. In the days since the ceasefire went into effect both sides have accused the other of violating its terms.\u0026nbspTurkey sends troops and electronic warfare tools to Libya Turkey approves deployment of troops to Libya in high-stakes battleTrump will come last in the Mediterranean gas race over LibyaBy wading into Libya, Erdogan risks a major Mediterranean conflictUS military drone ‘shot down by Russian forces in Libya’Mr Haftar may have ultimately acceded to the talks under pressure from his Egyptian and Emirati backers, who were lobbied by Mr Putin. “He’s cornered,” said Mr Harchaoui. “He’s already been given far more time and resources than he initially asked for. He cannot keep asking for more time. The Emiratis know they have time to fine tune the picture later on.”Mr Putin also has a history of making flashy diplomatic announcements in order to increase Russia’s diplomatic leverage and standing, only to walk away and let others deal with the fallout when agreements flounder and the shooting resumes.\u0026nbsp“It’s premature to talk about peace,” said Anas el-Gomati, a founder of the Sadegh Institute, a think tank focused on Libya. “The ceasefire will be temporary. It’s not designed to be operational. It’s designed for consumption. Russia is not interested in Libya. It’s interested in using Libya to pressure Europe and Turkey.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He wants to show voters that the country has moved on and the Government is once more focusing on the domestic issues voters care about.But however much he tries, it will be hard to make these talks boring. They are important and there is already DRAMA BREWING.Boris saw the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street this week. The pair got on well in their hour-long meeting. They both want these talks to be less acrimonious than the orce negotiations both want a more cordial tone.The pair reminisced about the school they had both attended in Brussels. Unlike Eton, it didn’t have playing fields, and until Johnson arrived the only game in the playground was marbles. He introduced some more rough and tumble.No were pleased that von der Leyen, rather than the more confrontational Michel Barnier, took the lead. As one No source points out, the EU loathed the lack of clarity and authority under Theresa May: She wasn’t clear what she wanted and it wasn’t certain that she could deliver what she wanted.With Boris and his new majority it is very dferent. He was able to point von der Leyen to the Tory manesto’s commitments on the future trade deal and say this was his mandate and that he was determined to deliver it.Yet despite the pair’s attempt to maintain a friendly tone, there are already tensions. Boris is irritated that the EU keeps saying it is nigh-on impossible to negotiate a full trade deal by December , despite having signed up to a political declaration that commits it to trying to do just that.The DANGER is that the EU thinks that under time pressure Boris will bend, that he will either extend the transition period — something he has repeatedly promised not to do — or drop his commitment to breaking away from EU rules and regulations.Boris is determined not to do either of these things. He doesn’t want to extend and believes in the value of the UK having the right to do things dferently.Both sides have frequently misunderstood each other in this process. Both sides must now realise that the other means what it says. Unless they do, there is going to be an almighty bust-up and no trade deal at the end of all this.THERE will be a National Security Council meeting later this month to decide whether or not to allow the Chinese company Huawei to be involved in the construction of the UK’s G network.This is an issue of fierce debate in Whitehall. Under Theresa May, it led to the then Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s sacking from government.Hawkish figures inside government fear No is leaning towards allowing Huawei’s involvement. One complains that Downing Street’s timetable for the technology’s roll-out is, “not realistic”, but that this time pressure means it will need Huawei involved. However, I understand that the Americans are pushing very hard for the UK to bar Huawei.One senior US government national security figure has been in London this week to lobby directly on this point.Before he makes a decision on Huawei, Boris Johnson should consider the damage it could do to Britain’s most important security relationship – the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement with Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand.Eventhe UK thinks it can manage Huawei’s involvement,our allies do not then we shouldn’t proceed. It is simply not worth the risk of undermining such a vital alliance.Don’t expect his approach to change. His holidays will be far more glam than Cameron and May’s were.THE most common reason British governments fail is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor fall out.If No and the Treasury – the most powerful department in government – aren’t on the same page, nothing gets done.Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid are determined to avoid this fate. In the run-up to the Budget on March , there will be a huge effort to make sure that the Treasury and No work together.One Johnson ally tells me the two men will have a Budget-focused meeting at the start of each week to make sure they are in agreement on the key issues.Then their teams will meet again mid-week to assess progress. Javid, whose job is safe in the coming reshuffle, is determined to show that the Treasury is capable of delivering on Boris Johnson’s agenda of levelling up across the country.Those close to him are confident that they can put meat on the bones of No’s plan.AT Cabinet this week it was impressed on ministers that one of the most important events this year is COP, the climate change conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November.The UK Government wants to use the event to show how Britain can lead on clean growth post-Brexit.I understand there will be a steady drum beat of announcements on this front throughout the year: The Tories want to show they are helping create new green-collar jobs.They also hope that by holding the event in Scotland, they can emphasise the benefits of the Union.THE Labour leadership contest has yet to catch fire.The Tories are not particularly concerned about any of the candidates.Though there is some hesitation about how they would handle PMQs with Jess Phillips, who likes to make very personal attacks on Boris Johnson.But the most interesting candidate in the race is Lisa Nandy.She seems to have the clearest understanding of why Labour lost.Her bid is starting to have faint echoes of David Cameron’s successful tilt at the Tory leadership in .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She didn’t meet them.Even the abdication of Edward VIII over Mrs Simpson, together below, was at Government and Church level.To have documents prepared in advance does not surprise me. The Queen has said she wants this sorted out and without delay.Many have called this an abdication and in one sense it is. Harry and Meghan expect to still have a handle on royal duty but also to lead a private le.What they mean by living financially independent, I don’t know. They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow. The sums he inherited from his mother and great grandmother have been invested.Meghan has some means but to live the sort of lestyle they are used to takes a lot of money.It is conceivable Charles could cut the money he gives to Harry —he gives him any at all. Being a dad, he probably will.But there are tax implications — particularlythere are handouts.Security has also to be considered. Harry is a prince of the United Kingdom, his grandmother head of state and father heir.The atmosphere at the meeting will be, up to a point, heated. But people won’t lose their tempers.The Queen is pragmatic. She understands problems people have but Harry will be fully aware of her displeasure. To go off half-cocked as he and Meghan did is unacceptable.The question is how dare they do that. She signed up for this.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

letter to Her Majesty, Michael Fabricant says Buckingham Palace’s dilemma over what to do with Prince Harry “could be turned into a huge triumphthey accept his proposal.And the MP says that far from being “a cause for sorrow,” the decision by Harry and Meghan to quit the Firm and relocate to Canada could instead be “a wonderful opportunity for both the Royal Family and our country at large”.He says the move would also bolster the monarchy’s reputation internationally and give the UK “an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union”.He points to a poll that found six in ten Canadians were in favour of Prince Harry becoming Governor General of Canada.Mr Fabricant says Prince Harry would be “well-suited to this role” due to his “valiant service in the Army” and charity work.The Governor is formally appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Canadian PM to carry out her constitutional and ceremonial duties in the country.The current incumbent is Julie Payette, an astronaut from Quebec, who has served since .Governors usually serve for five years but there is no constitutional timeframe.Mr Fabricant says that while she has done a “sterling job,” nobody has the “same kind of box office appeal that Harry does”.In his letter he writes: “As Your Majesty will no doubt be aware, the decision by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to step back from their royal duties to spend more time in North America has caused quite a stir among your loyal subjects.“While many disapprove of this, may I make the case that this can in fact be a wonderful opportunity for both the Royal Family and our country at large  A challenge could be turned to a huge triumph.”He adds: “While their methods and approach to royal duties may not always fall in line with tradition, there is no doubting that Harry and Meghan are seen by many of the younger generation as symbols of a new, modern, vibrant monarchy.”“Installing Harry as Governor General would not only bolster support for the Monarchy internationally, but also provide Canada, and by extension the United Kingdom, an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union.“There is also little doubt that Harry would be well-suited to this role.His valiant service in the Army, as well as his numerous charity works, give him more than enough experience to serve as Your Majestys representative to Canada.”As Your Majesty will no doubt be aware, the decision by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to step back from their royal duties to spend more time in North America has caused quite a stir among your loyal subjects.While many disapprove of this, may I make the case that this can in fact be a wonderful opportunity for both the Royal Family and our country at large  A challenge could be turned to a huge triumph.The departure of the Sussexes from these shores need not be a cause for sorrow. A recent Postmedia poll in Canada found that over % there were in favour of Prince Harry becoming the Governor General of Canada.The poll also showed that it was younger Canadians who would be most in favour of such a move, and that even in the generally French republican province of Quebec, almost half would also support this.The current Governor General, Julie Payette, who has been in post since , has done a sterling job. However, neither she, nor anyone  who has previously held this position, possess the same kind of box office appeal that Harry does.While their methods and approach to royal duties may not always fall in line with tradition, there is no doubting that Harry and Meghan are seen by many of the younger generation as symbols of a new, modern, vibrant monarchy.Installing Harry as Governor General would not only bolster support for the Monarchy internationally, but also provide Canada, and by extension the United Kingdom, an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union.Procedurally, there would be few barriers to making this a reality. The Governor General is appointed to the role on the advice of Canadian Prime Minister, and while the convention is for the Governor General to serve for around five years, there are no specic constitutional requirements for this.Thus,this is something Harry himself wished to do, a call from Her Majesty to Justin Trudeau would go a long way in pushing this along.I have the honour to remain, Madam, Your Majesty’s most humble and obedient servant.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

So we can compete. But when the field is tilted and people start making up the rules … thataposs when the problems start. Last week, as Samira Ahmed won her equal pay claim against the BBC, we saw just how the game is rigged. Ahmed, who hosts the viewer feedback programme, Newswatch, was paid seven times less than Jeremy Vine, who presents a similar programme, Points of View. Seven Times! The BBC justied this discrepancy by claiming that the Points of View needed a “cheeky” presenter with a “glint in his eye”. That’s some glint! The BBC clearly knew what they meant. They paid enough for it, I on the other hand wasn’t so sure. But when subjected to the critical eye of an impartial jury the rationale clearly fell apart. “Jeremy Vine read the script from the autocue,” their devastating assessment read. “He read it in the tone in which it was written. If it told him to roll his eyes, he did. It did not require any particular skill or experience to do that….We have dficulty in understanding what [the BBC] meant by a ‘glint in the eye’ and how that translated into a ‘skill’ or ‘experience’ for the job.  How does one acquire such a skill or experience ” The point here is not to do down Jeremy Vine. I like him and his competence was not on trial.  His pay is not going down. It is to try and decipher why a woman would be paid so much less for essentially the same work. How could Ahmed’s talents be so undervalued  How could her talents be so invisible  What were they thinking  How could this happen  As the shadow minister for equalities I know nobody in the BBC was sitting there thinking - “How can we pay a woman less than a white man for the same job ” This was not a deliberate ploy. Discrimination, nowadays, rarely works like that. True, there are people who think little of women and denigrate people of colour. One of them lives at Number . Imagine how the media would have treated meI had been caught having three affairs, one love child,  refused to tell anyone how many children I had and talked about white people the way Boris Johnson has talked about black people and Muslims. But beyond that gilded world, where a pliant media look past the prejudice of the privileged, many of us work in institutions that simply haven’t caught up with how the way the world has changed. They are driven by the same impulses and reflexes as they were when women were supposed to stop working once they had kids and black people were rarely seen and never heard. Ahmed was effectively caught in a system that devalues women and people of colour, failing to see their potential and to understand their contributions as valid.  We are judged by dferent standards. The verdict could leave the BBC with a bill running into the millions as similar claims by other female staff now come to the fore. But the cost to their reputation. This is the nation’s broadcaster. People expect more from the BBC. Ahmed certainly did. The bravery and tenacity it took for her to pursue this course of action cannot be underestimated. “I love working for the BBC,” she said.  “No woman wants to have to take action against their own employer.” Tomorrow I hope to make it onto the ballot for the Labour Party Deputy Leadership.  tle I’m certainly qualied. I’m the first elected black woman in Britain to ever become a minister I’ve had responsibilities under two Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and I have served in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet.  In  I won my seat from the Lib Dems with a .% swing - the biggest swing to Labour in the country. You would think that would be enough to get me on the ballot and then let Labour members decide whether I’m up to the job. My potential opponent does. Angela Rayner has generously called for some of those who nominated her to switch their vote to me so that we can have a full debate about the future of the party, just as I nominated Jeremy Corbyn, even though I initially supported Andy Burnham, because I thought it was important that his voice was heard. The field of Labour candidates standing for the leadership and deputy leadership, has never been more erse. It remains to be seen whether the candidates that the Parliamentary Labour Partyselect to put before the membership will reflect that.

Thereaposs just one problem. They want to come with us.  The WhatsApp messages that Meghan receives in her Pacic Ocean hideaway following the Sandringham Summit will probably not make the happiest of reading for their recipient. Because what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex donapost seem to have quite figured out is that their Megxit is an awful lot like Brexit. And some of itaposs not possible.Half of them want a massive change because theyaposre unhappy with the way things have been for the past , years. Itaposs all about taking back control, and lots of promises have been made about how great itaposs going to be on the sunlit uplands currently just out of sight, behind that massive constitutional obstacle. The real problem is that, now a vote has been publicly expressed, how much of it can be delivered without smashing the country to smithereens. Some people think itaposs all about race, others that itaposs to do with sovereignty, and thereaposs a lot of speculation and  claims about a thing that nobody in the country will admit they do not have a clue about.A large chunk of it is definitely to do with the Britainaposs long-held, fascinated disdain for all things American. All itaposs really lacking is a bus.Almost certainly, whatever plans are proposed for the Sussexes to consider, will take longer and involve more compromises than expected. You can make your own money, but the palace needs oversight of your contracts. You can live where you like, but choose a tax jurisdiction and stick with it. And the government reserves the right to tell you to shut up.Perhaps those are prices theyaposll decide itaposs wise to pay, for the sake of freedom. They were wise enough to ensure their son Archie had no title. Leaposs much better without one - just ask Zara Tindall.  The Queen will have seen how Brexit was made more damaging simply by dragging on for years. Megxit,it is to go well, must happen quickly - on paper,not in practice.So thereaposs the Queen in one corner, Philip upstairs in bed, hollering and banging his bedpan on the ceiling. A jetlagged Prince Charles on one side, wishing Diana was here to take the blame, and Prince William on the other, desperate to avoid a sibling sideshow that will overshadow his entire reign.And hereaposs Harry, slumped on the sofa just as he did after the strip billiards thing, and the Nazi thing, and the cannabis thing, getting it in the earhole and telling them that this time heaposs had enough and wants out. Harryaposs always wanted out. Finally, he has an excuse. ... I canapost believe youaposve made out this was a surprise. We told you all last year, Harry is saying. You asked me to write down a proposal. I told you it would leak. You insisted, and then it leaked, and now all the Royal reporters are saying youaposre surprised. Truth is, THEYaposRE surprised and youaposre using it against me. Eh  Whataposs that  Canapost hear you, damned thingaposs playing up again, says the Queen, fiddling with a hearing aid she decided would give her some plausible deniability.Weaposd all like out, Harry. We all hate the Press, and we all use it - just as you and your we do, sighs Charles, who has had this argument more than once with every member of his family for  years. Point is, Royals are millionaires who NEED to live like billionaires, or  Richard Branson would seem more royal than us. Weaposre cash-poor, and weaposre not allowed to sell anything.Harry grumbles. Jusapos wanna make money and do good stuff instead of being a lazy arse leeching off the taxpayer infor two daysapos work a week, like the rest of you. How come Iaposm the one in trouble and not the Duke of Dork   BECAUSE YOUaposRE THE ONE ROCKING THE BOAT! Philip is heard bellowing from upstairs. BLOODY I WANT THIS AND THAT AND NOTHINGaposS GOOD ENOUGH. WASNaposT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, MY BOY BUT I DAMN WELL PUT UP WITH IT! Told you not to marry an actress, bloody fool thing to do...Harry is outraged. Hang on, Granpa! You reformed the monarchy! TV interviews, a televised coronation, ditching the police guards, driving yourself around London in an environmentally-friendly taxi, the family taking your name - all things they said couldnapost be done! You upturned the Establishment, and now you ARE the Establishment you say I canapost do the same.The Royals all look a bit uncomfortable but the Queen, who has magically heard this bit, says: Weaposve all got things we want to change about the monarchy. But itaposs a constitutional miracle weaposre still here at all. Itaposs a case of softly, softly, catchee monkey. Racist, mutters Harry.  William decides to be big brother. Look, weaposre fine with you leaving. Suits us all, probably. Butyou go now, my children have to put up with more of the attention and we all have to do more work.But Wills,we can make a go of it thereaposll be an exit route for Charlotte and Louis too! bursts out Harry. Theyaposre going to have the same problem as me, as Auntie Margaret - born to be understudies for a role theyaposll never have, and doomed to a le of living off the hospitality of increasingly-rackety friends. Elton John wonapost live forever, you know. The Queen gestures at an aide, who presents Harry with a one-page document from a folder. As you know, one has asked oneaposs advisers for an exit plan. One doesnapost wish to lose you, nor your we, who has managed the astonishing feat of making this family beloved by those parts of the world weaposve literally ridden our horses over. But we canapost have you cocking around with the British constitution. So the plan is, you keep your HRH, strike whatever deals you like, and live where you please. Youaposll still be invited for Christmas and can swan about doing your feminist environmentalism or whatever it is. We want Megxit done quickly and painlessly, so it doesnapost turn into a total saga.  Thereaposs just one catch, the Queen goes on. And itaposs something youaposre probably not expecting.One wants to go with. One wishes to keep oneaposs houses, not Buck House of course, damned thingaposs falling down. But the ponies, the frocks, the right for oneaposs children to pin on medals for things they havenapost done. Colonels will have to colonel their own regiments, Lord Lieutenants can take back control of their own tree-planting ceremonies, Prime Ministers can have sovereignty and see how they bloody like it. One is orf. Iaposm going to call it REXIT. Harry is thunderstruck. But... but... how can you hope to be financially independent Charles is going to sell Cornwall to pay for the coppers, and weaposll all move in with you and Megsie. The Queen gives a mirthless grin. Givenchy say they want me as brand ambassador, and the government says we can help with trade deals. Meghan will be have to do the chlorinated chicken hard-sell, instead. But... the constitution... security... the potential for international embarrassment... stutters Harry.All gone, smiles the Queen, waving a hand. If we all go, those problems cease to exist! Itaposs the only way to make it possible, and besides weaposre all stinking jealous of how much money youaposre going to make. Itaposs a case of oneaposs out, all out!And there you have it. The best form of Brexit the UK could enjoy would beevery other EU state were to Leave as well, agreed to follow the same rules, have custom-free trade and frictionless borders. We could call it the EUK. As for Megxit, the only way to remove the political risks of Royals who leave the tent is for the tent to go with them. For both, people can believe they have wrought a great change, while in reality their lives stay comfortably the same.

Cash-strapped Michael and Linda Chatha have broken up and decided to raffle off Shrubbery Farm, in Longnor, Shrewbury, after struggling to find a buyer. A £ ticket includes stamp duty and legal fees, with the couple, who have lived at the property  years, hoping to sell , to meet the valuation and cover other fees. They were inspired by another home owner who sold over £ million-worth of tickets for his £,-valued property. Michael said with he and Linda deciding to go their separate ways, they put the cottage on the market last year but failed to find a buyer probably because of the housing market and Brexit. The cottage, just an houraposs drive from Birmingham, also includes The Granary - a self-contained annex, and is estimated to have doubled in value in  years. If , tickets arenapost sold, the lucky winner can instead take away  per cent of the receipts, butthe raffle rakes in more than expected the Chathaaposs will make a big donation to Hope House. The charity supports children with le-limiting illnesses and their families. Michael, originally from Sutton Coldfield and dad to Charlie, , and Jack, , said it was a privilege to have lived in their dream country cottage since .  The idyllic property boasts exposed beams throughout every room and a farmhouse style kitchen with an oil-fired AGA and walk-in pantry. It backs onto a th century church and Longnor Hall, with its medieval deer park, which means it is very secluded with almost no neighbours. While a primary school, rated aposOutstandingapos by Ofsted, is within walking distance. Shrewsbury town is a quarter of an hour up the road, and Church Stretton and Ludlow are close, while the Welsh coast is just  minutes down the road. I was born and bred in Sutton Coldfield and when we had Charlie we used to come out here to go to a country pub and said it would be wonderful to find a place to live here, said Michael, who works in marketing for a software company.  It was more than we could afford but we said you only live once so we stretched ourselves and itaposs been a wonderful home and a great investment. Our children went to the Ofsted-rated Outstanding school up the road and the local community is great. Ludlow, with all its lovely restaurants, is only  minutes away, you can be in Birmingham and Chester within an hour, and within  minutes you can be dipping your feet in the water in Aberdovey in Wales. He added: We know lots of people from Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham would love the idea of living in a country home but the winner could do what they like with it, whether thataposs to rent it out, start an Air BnB or sell it themselves.Itaposs already started to go viral, with lots of people tweeting about it in America. Weaposve had calls from the James Corden and Ellen shows, and GMTV too. The tickets have been selling like crazy in the last couple of hours.  The property was valued last summer by two leading estate agents at £, and £, respectively."},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan markles private whatsapp","story":"NewsHarry and Meghan Markles private WhatsApp plan during crunch talks with QueenPrince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will in a matter of hours discuss their future within the Royal Family with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince WilliamShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video summit-sandringham-harry-meet-queen-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news harry-meghan-markles-private-whatsapp-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle are planning to communicate privately via WhatsApp during todayaposs unprecedented summit, it has been claimed. Harry, , will join the Queen, , Prince Charles, , and Prince William, , for crunch talks about his future in a matter of hours at Sandringham. Meghan, , who reportedly flew to Canada a few days ago, is said to hope to take part in the meeting via a conference call. And it is claimed the former actress will use the popular phone messaging app to exchange strategies with her husband.A royal source claimed to The Sun: “They want to be able to chat one-to-one as the main players delve into the nitty-gritty of their breakaway.”The extraordinary negotiations come after the couple announced they would be aposstepping backapos as senior royals and plan to become financially independant. Kensington Palace did not wish to comment. Meanwhile, the Queen is to chair todayaposs crisis talks as she joins her family to thrash out a plan for Harry and Meghan. The historic meeting at her private estate will be the first time Harry has met with his grandmother, the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge since the issue engulfed the royal family this week, making headlines around the world. The couple triggered a aposroyal crisisapos by announcing last week they would be stepping back from their duties and spending more time in North America.  It is claimed the couple consulted neither the Queen nor Charles on the announcement, made on Instagram and their own website, a step seen as impertinent and premature. Harry and Meghan said they wanted to carve out a progressive new role for themselves and work to become financially independent. But it was unclear how the couple will become what royal biographers said was akin to being a half royal - and who will pay for their transatlantic lestyles. Meghan has ed to Canada to be with their son Archie after the couple spent six weeks in the country in late .  The duchess flew to Canada a few days ago where the family spent an extended festive break in the province of British Columbia. It is thought William will be travelling to the estate in Norfolk from his Kensington Palace apartment and Harry from Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle. Charles was in Oman to attend a condolence ceremony following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, and was due to travel back to the UK on Sunday evening. The Queen attended church at Sandringham on Sunday where wellwishers expressed sympathy for her, and clapped as she left, with some members of the public saying that Harry and Meghan should not receive any more taxpayersapos money.  The monarch was pictured arriving for the service wearing a hearing aid for what is believed to be the first time in public. Harry and Meghan are said to have left the Queen feeling hurt by their bombshell announcement that they plan to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. There are a range of issues to be discussed today, and it is likely the royals will try to come to some agreement before the meeting ends to stop the immediate crisis causing lasting damage to the monarchy. Harry and Meghanaposs statement - and a new official Sussexroyal website - have thrown up important questions about funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles.  Other important issues to resolve include who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly America. It is not known what time the family plan to meet, how long the summit is expected to last or whether the entire day has been set aside to find a solution. Before the meeting, the royals will be given written proposals produced by their offices and others, including relevant government departments from the UK and Canada, where it is thought Harry and Meghan will establish a second home.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA Hermes delivery driver has been sacked after being caught unzipping his pants and urinating on a family home. Dan Cecchini said he felt aposviolatedapos after catching the driver in the act in December last year. His complaint to the delivery giant prompted the company to fire their worker. Dan was in the bath on December  when his security system alerted him on his phone to movement outside his St Leonards-on-Sea home. The shocking CCTV footage showed a Hermes courier walking down steps into Danaposs property, where he appears to unzip his trousers and relieve himself in a corner. The -year-old dad-of-two then opens the window to challenge the delivery driver - only for him to act innocent and claim he was looking for his neighbour. Hermes got in touch with the audio engineer on December  and apologised aposfor the courier peeing on your propertyapos, adding that that kind of behaviour aposis not toleratedapos. But after Dan asked the courier company when the pee was going to be cleaned up, the delivery giant simply aposfobbed him offapos and told him that the aposquery [had been] resolvedapos. After his dog got wet paws in the pee, disgusted Dan has now made the area aposoff limitsapos to his children. To add insult to injury, Dan uses the spot as a delivery safe space and two more parcels were dropped off in the same spot days later, which he claims were left smelling of urine. After Hermes were contacted for comment, the delivery giant confirmed that the driver would no longer be working for them and that they would clean up the urine. Dan said: You can see him go open the zip. Itaposs clear, heaposs not putting a parcel there. Itaposs obvious. You could smell it afterwards.Someone on Facebook said aposoh look, it looks like heaposs peeing into a drainapos but thereaposs no drain there. Thereaposs a pipe, but thereaposs no drainapos.I just felt a bit violated, really. Youaposve caught someone peeing on your [property] and youaposve got evidence.  I got a notication on my phone there was movement in one of the alleys [on my property]. And I had my phone in the bath so I could see there was a driver walking down the steps. I was like aposokay they normally put the packages thereapos. That was what was pretty rank about it all. I couldnapost quite see what heaposd actually done until I looked at the video afterwards. So I just thought he was being suspicious - I couldnapost quite work out what was going on. He ended up doing a pee where all our Christmas packages get left - itaposs our safe spot with other couriers. So thataposs why I was like [to Hermes] aposyou need to come and clean this upapos because consequently other packages came and got delivered there, which is a bit grim. He could have knocked on the door and said he was desperate for the loo and I would have just said cool, hereaposs the loo. I just thought the fact that he blagged me when he was saying aposoh Iaposm just looking for somethingapos. Maybe we would have done the same thing - you just panic, I donapost know. It still hasnapost been cleaned up. We put some cardboard down but itaposs pretty grim in that itaposs rained and itaposs spread all the pee onto our decking. He scarpered off pretty quickly and thataposs annoying. Weaposve all been out and about and need to pee, I get it. But the fact that Hermes has shut us down - itaposs a simple thing to sort out.  The next day I went out to have a lookI could choose another safe space to get Amazon to not leave stuff down there after the two ASOS parcels arrived. Itaposs just annoying, I should have maybe thought about it a bit more, but thataposs pretty infuriating that weaposre having to put stuff in the shower to wipe this dudeaposs wee off it. When I turned around Peanut our dog was in there snfing and his feet were wet. Peanut got this dudeaposs pee on his wet paws so we just dumped him in the bath.

It is understood that Meghan and Harry didnapost consult any of their relatives before making their announcement on Instagram , only sending the statement to Charles and William  minutes before they told the world their intentions.There have been a number of official statements over the past few days giving an insight into how things are looking behind palace walls. Weaposve taken a look at how each member of the Royal Family responded to the news, both publicly and privately. The Queen Harryaposs grandmother is said to be deeply hurt by the Duke and Duchessapos actions and has called him to a crisis meeting at Sandringham today. It is understood Her Majesty knew little of Harry and Meghanaposs plans until reading them on an iPad at her Sandringham estate before switching on the news.Before Meghan and Harry told the world they will be stepping back from their roles as senior royals, the Duke wanted to discuss his decision with the Queen. However itaposs claimed he didnapost plan on negotiating with the Monarch, and instead just wanted to talk to her grandson to granny to explain why they were doing it. He called her up to askhe could come to Sandringham for a chat, to which she agreed, however things quickly went downhill in what has been described as a classic move by the Palace. The source added: He has been communicating with her on the phone throughout. He wanted to see her, not to negotiate with her but to talk to her grandson to granny, to say, ‘This is how we have come to this.’He called her at Sandringham, where she is still enjoying her Christmas break, and askedhe could go up to Norfolk to see her. She reportedly said: Yes, love to see you, come and see me.  But the meeting never happened, with a source claiming: A message was conveyed: ‘Oh, sorry, misunderstanding, she might have said she was available, but actually she is not available.’However the Queen made it very clear that he wasnapost to publicly announce the plans for now - but Harry is said to have ignored this, sharing the statement on Wednesday evening. Shortly afterwards the Queen released her own statement reading: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. Prince Philip Furious Prince Philip is said to have barked what the hell are they playing at  after learning about Harry and Meghanaposs plan to quit royal le.  The Queenaposs husband, , was reportedly furious when he was told and is understood to have accused his grandson of disrespecting the monarch.  hilip, who retired from public le in , now spends much of his time in a farmhouse on the edge of the Norfolk estate, but is believed to have ed to the main house to comfort the disappointed Queen in the wake of the crisis.A source told The Sun on Sunday that Philip asked “what the hell are they playing at ” after being told about Harry and Meghanaposs announcement.The source added: To say that the Duke feels let down would be a considerable understatement. He is deeply hurt. “But he was spitting blood when aides informed him what had happened. Philip has accused Harry and Meghan of lacking respect and he is weary of their behaviour. Philip was today seen being driven away from the Sandringham estate ahead of the Queenaposs crisis talks with her heirs. Prince CharlesAccording to the Evening Standard , Charles and William were only sent a copy of the statement  minutes before it was made public - and they were not given any further information. Both men are said to be incandescent with rage . Harry reportedly spoke to his dad before Christmas expressing his desire to spend more time in Canada and was told to come up with a concrete plan. The couple put together a full proposal, detailing how they would make the plan work, which they sent over to Charles at the start of the New Year. However, they were reportedly told they needed to spend more time thinking it through. They were told there were complex implications that needed to be worked out.A source told The Times : It reached an impasse where his father said, ‘We need to have these conversations in person. This is not something we can negotiate over email.’The Duchess of Cambridge Kate celebrated her th birthday amid all the royal drama, with Kensington Palace ignoring all the goings on to share a gorgeous new photo of the Duchess. However she was today pictured looking strained ahead of her husband and brother-in-lawaposs crisis talks.She was photographed driving in London this morning, wearing a cream coat with her hair tied back. Prince William Wills is said to be just as angry about Harryaposs decision as his father. Over the weekend there were reports that William had spoken to a friend about his “sadness” at the broken bond with his brother in the wake of Megxit. According to the Sunday Times , he expressed sorrow that he and Prince Harry are now ‘separate entities’.The report claims the Duke told a friend: “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that anymore we’re separate entities. “I’m sad about that. All we can do, and all I can do is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we’re all singing from the same page. “I want everyone to play on the team.”However this morning he released a joint statement with his younger brother denying bullying claims ."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle avoids detection 134","story":"NewsMeghan Markle avoids detection on £ budget flight back to £m Canadian mansionThe Duchess of Sussex evaded TV crews when she ed to North America on Canadas low-cost WestJet airline after announcing plans to step back from royal roleShareCommentsByPippa Allen-Kinross:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-meghan-step-back-royal-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markle-avoids-detection--\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Duchess of Sussex ed to the £ million waterside Vancouver Island mansion where she spent Christmas with Prince Harry but managed to avoid TV crews when she flew in using the low-cost WestJet airline. The media, who assumed she would be on a private jet, missed her arrival, Mail Online has reported. Over Christmas, local residents were asked by royal protection offers to hold back from revealing their location for at least a couple of weeks to allow the royal couple some time to themselves.  The couple reportedly went hiking and jogging, and even did some Christmas shopping in the nearby town. Chris Stephen, owner of Lilaberry Home Decor in the nearby town of Sidney-by-the-Sea, said Harry came into her store just before Christmas with a protection officer to buy festive table decorations - but in her shock, she mistakenly called him aposPrince Andrewapos. Chris said Harry had a blue woollen hat over his eyes and mumbled in a fake Canadian accent into the collar of his coat. I thought there was something familiar about him, even though I could barely see his face, she said. And then I said, aposOh my God, youaposre Prince Andrew!apos. One of her colleagues corrected her, and Chris said she nearly fainted and must have shrieked. She said she wanted to give him a motherly hug but was asked by the officer to be discreet. We went and had a chat in the storeroom and the first thing Harry said to me - looking horried - was: aposI canapost believe you thought I was Prince Andrew! I told him that I was so overwhelmed I forgot his name. He said he tried to disguise his voice by speaking with a Canadian accent and I told him he made a terrible job of it.  In the end I did give him a hug – a big mum hug – and he was very gracious and patient with me, a real well-mannered guy. It is not known how long Meghan is intending to stay in Canada. Harry is not expected to leave the UK until at least next weekend while he deals with the aftermath of the coupleaposs shock announcement that they would step back from their roles as senior royals. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have said they plan to become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. Harry is due to attend a crisis meeting on Monday with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William on Monday.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSenior members of the royal family are preparing for a crunch summit at Sandringham today to decide Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs future in the firm.   The Queen wants to get issues surrounding their future resolved quickly and gave senior aides just days to come up with a plan. Those attending the meeting, which is expected to take place this morning, include the Queen, Prince Charles, William and Harry. Meghan is also likely to be dialling in from Canada at am local time. Key issues for the future of Meghan and Harryaposs relationship with the Royal Family will be discussed after last weekaposs sensational announcement that they intend to aposstep backapos as senior royals. It is possible that nothing will be resolved today and there are reports that the so-called aposabdicationapos of the young royal couple could take months. All three of William, Charles and the Queen are expected to warn that there are signicant obstacles to be overcome before Harry and Meghan can make their move. Important questions thrown up by Harry and Meghanaposs new website are likely to be central to discussions. Funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles will be very important. A vital issue to resolve includes who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly the US. At the meeting, it is understood Harry will be presented with documents put together following talks with the tax authorities in the UK and Canada, after the couple said they wish to be aposfinancially independentapos and seek to make their own money away from royal le. The Duke and Duchess potentially face a aposdouble taxapos on commercial income and bills running into the millions from numerous authorities, reports the Mail Online .  And with Canada requiring residents and certain property owners to pay income tax on global earnings, in a similar way to the UK, Harry could be forced to give up his UK residency or limit his time in Canada. Harry and Meghan have said the Sovereign Grant makes up just five per cent of their income and is only used for official office expenses and that they intend to give it up as they aim to become financially independent. But with hundreds of thousands still likely to be spent from public money each year for official travel abroad, this will likely be a key issue at the meeting. The Sussexesapos website states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £.million. It is likely to be discussed whether Charles is willing to continue to allow this. It has been reported they may be keen to make promotional deals abroad to allow for financial independence, but these may not be compatible with their royal work. Also, the Queen owns their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage , which was renovated to the cost of £.m recently, but surveys suggest the public may not be keen for them to retain it. Itaposs possible that the financially independent royal couple may be required to pay some form of rent to stay there.  Although reportedly left hurt by Harry and Meghanaposs actions, the Queen is not given to rash decisions, and will be approaching the talks in a calm and pragmatic way. One question thrown up is whether the couple will keep their HRH titles but it is thought senior royals are not keen on stripping them of the status. Also, the couple are unlikely to surrender their titles as their aposSussexRoyalapos brand is built on them. Heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles is the future king and currently bankrolls Harry and Meghanaposs public duties through his £ million-a-year Duchy of Cornwall income. The extent to which this will continue seems likely to crop up. The prince is a caring, sensitive soul, and is said to be furious at how Harry and Meghan have handled the situation. He is committed to his royal duty, but will also want his youngest son, who endured the loss of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, when he was only , and Meghan to be happy. The talks also come amid repeated reports of a falling out between Harry and William. Older brother William, who was said to be incandescent with rage at the Sussexesapos actions, is a future king, and his position within the royal family is vastly dferent from sixth-in-line Harry, who has moved steadily down the line of succession and has to carve out his own role. In his ITV interview on a tour of Africa, Harry conceded that he and William aposhave good days and bad daysapos and are aposon dferent pathsapos. What future working relationship the two princes have will be interesting to see after Harry takes his step back.  For Meghan and Harry, their priorities will be ensuring a smooth retreat from royal le that enables them to fulfil their work with charities and in Africa on the causes that interest them. The Duke and Duchess said in their statement, they want to carve out a progressive new role, and continue to collaborate with the Queen. How their new commercial work ties in with this collaboration with the royal family could be determined by todayaposs talks.  Meghan may have flown back to Canada, but she will likely be dialling into the meeting as the proposals on offer are discussed. The intelligent, driven American former actress, who is just  months into her royal le, will be focused on the work she and Harry are keen to do.  Speaking about coping with intense tabloid interest, the Duchess has said: Itaposs not enough to just survive something, thataposs not the point of le. You have got to thrive. Harry has remained in the UK to deal with the fallout of the announcement and will be at todayaposs talks, but Meghan is understood to have flown back to Canada within hours to be with son Archie.

Todayaposs historic meeting at the Queenaposs private Sandringham estate will be the first time Harry has met with his grandmother, the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge since the issue engulfed the royal family this week, making headlines around the world.  Meghan is with their baby son Archie in Canada, but a royal source said it is likely she will join the crisis talks by phone. The duchess flew to Canada a few days ago where the family spent an extended festive break in the province of British Columbia.It is thought William will be travelling to the estate in Norfolk from his Kensington Palace apartment and Harry from Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle.Charles was in Oman to attend a condolence ceremony following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, and was due to travel back to the UK on Sunday evening. The Queen attended church at Sandringham on Sunday where wellwishers expressed sympathy for her, and clapped as she left, with some members of the public saying that Harry and Meghan should not receive any more taxpayersapos money.  The -year-old monarch was pictured arriving for the service wearing a hearing aid for what is believed to be the first time in public. Harry and Meghan are said to have left the Queen feeling hurt by their bombshell announcement that they plan to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. There are a range of issues to be discussed today, and it is likely the royals will try to come to some agreement before the meeting ends to stop the immediate crisis causing lasting damage to the monarchy. Harry and Meghanaposs statement - and a new official Sussexroyal website - have thrown up important questions about funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles.  Other important issues to resolve include who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly America. It is not known what time the family plan to meet, how long the summit is expected to last or whether the entire day has been set aside to find a solution. Before the meeting, the royals will be given written proposals produced by their offices and others, including relevant government departments from the UK and Canada, where it is thought Harry and Meghan will establish a second home. It is not known who ,anyone, will be at the meeting - but it is likely the private secretaries of the four royals may join part of the talks to assist with any questions. On Thursday, the Queen, Charles and William gave orders for their households to work with the Sussexesapos team to quickly find a workable solution to their desire to change the direction of their royal lives, but still support the Queen.

Rachael Fitzgerald and partner Mark Maddocks woke at am on holiday in Crete, Greece, to find their daughter Lara unresponsive in their hotel room. Mark desperately tried to revive the tot, but she was tragically pronounced dead at the scene. Tests were carried out in Greece but experts were unable to establish a cause of death. At an inquest, a doctor said Laraaposs parents from Hale, near Altrincham, Greater Manchester may never know the reason for their daughteraposs unexpected death. The couple had been trying for eight years for their first child, and everything fell into place with the birth of their daughter in March of last year. Born at  weeks Lara was described as being the aposaposperfect little girl with a bigger social le than many adults. She would regularly be out in her buggy with her mother and was affectionately nicknamed Lady Lara. The tragedy occurred on July  last year after the family checked into the Village Heights Hotel in the Greek resort of Hersonissos. The inquest heard that Lara had recently been treated for symptoms of a cold but otherwise appeared to be in perfect health. Miss Fitzgerald told the Stockport hearing: “Her last feed that night was about pm. About am I woke up and I just looked at her though I was facing the other way and turned my head. She was just on her back and just looked very peaceful and normal but I knew that something’s not right. “I said aposLara, Laraapos but she never normally wakes till about am so it was still early really. I didn’t get a response and picked her up and her arm just slipped down and chaos went on from there. Mark grabbed her and tried to resuscitate her. She was warm she wasn’t blue.  “It doesn’t make sense. I’m obsessed with suffocation issues and you just go through these things - but nothing was near her.” Miss Fitzgerald added: aposaposLara was amazing, she liked to be in the buggy it was just a nice greyish silver cross as we didn’t know whether we were having a boy or girl - she had everything.aposapos Mr Maddocks, a Swisspirt aircraft dispatcher, said: “We tried so hard for a long time to have a child - for eight years. But in the end it all worked and Lara was so good she slept a lot and didn’t cry - she was perfect. “She went everywhere with us, she went more places than some people had been in a le time. In the three months, like some of our friends saying where’s Lady Lara lunching today  Was out all the time.” Dr Melanie Newbold, a paediatric pathologist from Manchester Royal Children’s Hospital, said: “I was able to say that Lara looked like a perfect little girl and seemed to be well grown for her age and no problems with growth. “Absolutely no signs of suffocation, no evidence whatsoever that suffocation was involved in her death. “No signs of any illness and internal organs where all perfectly normally formed. No evidence of overwhelming sepsis . Some evidence that she might have had a recent cold like almost everybody had. Other than that no positive findings. Signs of cold wouldn’t have caused her to die.  “Very rare to find evidence of why they have died. It’s not unusual sadly. aposaposOf course when doing the post mortem can identy things that we can see either by the nature of evidence or down a microscope. Many people at all ages not just babies but most frequently in babies because of something that’s happened in there body. “Might just be in the case of a baby just stopping breathing a simple reason. We don’t understand, know that they can take place but can’t identy them at post mortem as there is no evidence that this has happened. “If it was death due to over heating in the sense that she was very very hot there usually would be features here. But there’s no evidence that that was the case for her. “We used to call it sudden death syndrome or cot death, we don’t really understand all the factors might be that we never will.” In a statement read to the court, family GP Dr Helen Symcox, said: “Lara was born at  weeks. Had her first set of immunisations and was seen on June , for upper respiratory tract infection and was a bit snuffly. She was active and alert and smiling and her chest was clear.  “On June , took her to the surgery with what was thought to be another cold and was a bit snuffly and dribbling a bit. But was drinking her milk and having water so had no concerns.” The court heard how the GP spoke to her mother about using sun cream and keeping her hydrated and was happy for her to go on holiday. Recording a conclusion of death by natural causes, coroner Alison Mutch told Laraaposs parents: “It’s clear that she had quite a little personality about her. Also came over in the evidence just how well loved and looked after she was. “She had a very short le but clearly a very happy le and was very very well looked after. What we know is that she had a social le that few of us could ever aspire to and was out and about and loved being out and about. She was obviously a very sociable little girl. “As a family you made the decision to go on holiday and then went to the GP to check they where happy and she was okay for you to go away.

Today Prince Harry will arrive at his grandmother’s Norfolk estate, where in happier years gone by he has enjoyed warm-hearted Christmas celebrations surrounded by the love and laughter of his closest family. But his latest visit to Sandringham, after he and Meghan turned down the Queen’s invitation to join the festivities last month, will be remembered as one of the most extraordinary days in modern royal history. Summoned by the Queen to meet her, flanked by her eldest son and grandson, there will be no clearer indication of what matters above all  in this family namely, the line of succession and the monarchy. Harry will no doubt feel he is entering the lion’s den, especially without the support of his co-conspirator who has fled to Canada leaving him to face the music alone. But he would do well to remember the family, at their very core, do have his best interests at heart and are keen for him and Meghan to rein back and look at what is at stake for all involved. There would have perhaps been no need for this most extraordinary summit had their enforced and somewhat hastily arranged exit from The Firm not been so poorly executed. He has upset the Queen, angered his father, and his brother William has said the once devoted brothers are now “separate entities” and he can no longer put his arm around himhe doesn’t want to be on the “team”.

The -year-old, who performed at The Dorchester Hotel for  years, has played for celebrities including Shirley Bassey, Kate Moss, Simon Cowell and Jools Holland. But mingling with celebrities didn’t stop his descent into poverty after he was violently attacked and forced to give up his job. He now wants to shed light on the dficulties of living on Universal Credit, as he claims the threat of sanctions hangs over him despite applying for  jobs a week. Since May, Lee has been in the Better Working Futures programme which aims to get people with dficulties back into work but claims he has been offered unsuitable work he must accept.Are you a struggling parent on Universal Credit  Email  webnews@mirrorThe pianist, whose stage name was Lee Mathews, said: “It’s been tough. “I’ve been on that programme since May and all they do is tick boxes every week I go. “The people they have there are not qualied to deal with people who have had previous mental health problems. “I’d be rooting around in bins or use food banksI got sanctioned. “The entire thing isn’t fit for purpose.” Lee had always played the piano and went from gigging at local restaurants to being put forward for the £k job at the Dorchester when he was . He also played at other top London venues including the Savoy, Claridge’s and the Lanesborough, with a steady stream of A-listers hearing him tinkle the ivories.  Visitors also remarked on TripAdvisor what a superb player he was when enjoying their afternoon tea at the landmark Dorchester. But in June  he was violently attacked after meeting someone from an internet dating site. The assault, which left him in hospital for three days, led him to suffer a breakdown and PTSD. He tried to continue working but found the constant stream of gigs too much and eventually had to give up his rented home near Rickmansworth, Herts. After living in a string of hostels and BnBs, Lee eventually went home to Durham to live with his parents in December  as he battled to get over the assault. He signed on in January  and was put on Universal Credit, earning benefits of £-a-month plus housing benefit of £ when he found his own flat. He also had counselling and financial help from Help Musicians UK, a charity which supports struggling musicians in times of hardship.  He says he is desperate to get his old career back and has been playing at weddings and parties in the north east to earn a bit of spare cash. He also regularly travels down to London to take any gig he can - even though the travel costs often mean he makes nothing. Since May this year he has been on the Better Working Futures programme, run by employment agency Reed, which tries to help people who face additional barriers get back into work. But he says he has been offered driving jobs he can’t do alongside other positions he simply isn’t qualied for. And even sending out  emails a week enquiring about work is not enough to stop him being threatened with his money being cut off, he says. Lee said: “I had points on my licence and they tried to get me sanctioned for not applying for a job as a delivery driver. “He said I’d be sanctionedI refused to do the interview. It caused me a lot of upset. “I thought I’d lose my benefits and when you get sanctioned you have no money for a long period of time, sometimes three months. “I’m doing  job applications a week and it’s still not enough for them. “The people they are employing to help people like me are making their conditions worse. “The interviews they are doing are uncomfortable and I feel like I’m being harassed and forced to take on jobs I’m not qualied to do. “They’re not interested in helping me further my career.

Plain and simple. While many sympathise with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s desire to step back as senior Royals, the way they chose to do it has provoked justiable shock and outrage. Petulant, hot-headed and impulsive are just some of the barbs aimed at the couple after the bombshell public announcement that they wished to become part-time Royals and live much of the time abroad. Inconsiderate, disloyal and reckless might also be appropriate. In more than  years on the throne, the Queen has shown with impeccable style, dignity and judgement how the “old firm” should be run. The sacrices she and other members of the Royal Family have made have been not only for the monarchy, but for the nation.  That, by the antiquated system of a monarchic state, is their responsibility by birth. And Her Majesty embraced that responsibility with grace, as even republicans admit. Harry and Meghan’s wish to break away might be seen as an understandable cry for modernisation. Their desire to do so has been evident for a long time. But discussing their intentions with friends such as Elton John before the Queen, and going ahead with their announcement without thinking through the full impact on their family or the monarchy, has caused a totally avoidable crisis. That the Queen has had to intervene – calling a Royal showdown at Sandringham tomorrow to deal with the crisis – is a measure of the scale of the embarrassment caused.  She is right to step in and call the wayward couple to heel. Only she has the authority to bang heads together and ensure a smoother route to whatever the future holds. The Wrong Cure  The crisis in our health service starts at the front line, the family doctor. The GP is an absolute cornerstone of the National Health Service, the first stop for all ages from cradle to grave. It is a service that is essential to personal health, and to the economy of the country. With a shortage of at least , GPs, Tory promises of more on the way are not enough. Government action on over-complicated red tape preventing overseas doctors from coming here to ease the gap is long overdue. Rocking On Rod Stewart is a national treasure who just refuses to act his age.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA man who proposed to a woman half his age because he thought the sex would be better and her younger body was more enjoyable. Jason Smith, , met Azarel Smith, now , on online dating site  Match  in February . Office manager Azarel was just  years old at the time they first agreed to meet up for a dinner date. Jason, a lawyer, said he was swept away by Azarel’s beauty as sparks flew for the couple, although they were sceptical of each other’s intentions at first. After dating on and off for the first few years, love prevailed and Jason popped the question in  during their trip to Las Vegas. The pair are now engaged and living together with plans for marriage in the near future. Jason, who was married once before, admitted he wanted to date younger women because he thought the “sex would be better” and didn’t want to be pressurised into marriage and kids. He said: “Being with a younger girl is exciting. She introduces me to new adventures, new songs, lingo etc. She has a more open mind when it comes to the world and obviously a better body. “She’s made me a much happier man. She’s supportive of me and business. Something I was missing when single. She has a way of keeping me focused and really mindful of the world. “Truthfully, I thought the sex would be better. “That she was less likely to push for immediate marriage and kids. I just really wanted a relationship where I didn’t feel like there would be that kind of pressure. “Also, I felt like I was at an age where I had the time and money to entertain someone ‘fresh’. In reality I can’t say the reason sex is better is because of age. I would have to credit it to being more in love now. “But she does have a better body than the older women I’ve dated. Which I’m sure makes things more enjoyable as well.” However, the pair abstained from sex within the first few years of their relationship under Azarel’s wishes. She said: “We abstained from sex the first few years of our relationship. Jason was very respectful of my choice and treated me like a lady. “The no sex didn’t deter him from doing nice things or loving me. Respect I wasn’t used to getting from guys.” Since they began dating, the pair have been swept up in a whirlwind romance and always teach each other new things, saying how that is a fundamental part of being in a relationship with someone. Azarel, who is interested in going to law school, said that Jason has given her much needed help and guidance when it comes to her career and even personal le.  Speaking about their relationship, she said: “You get to be with someone who has experienced more of le, so they can give really wise input to help you make better decisions. “Whether that be with your professional le, or personal le. For instance, I just finished my bachelors and trying to figure out my next steps. “I’m interested in getting into law school and Jason has been there to help me through the process since he’s already done it himself.” She added: “I’ve experienced a lot that I could have only dreamed about doing before him. For the first time in a relationship, I truly am able to be my naturally mature self and feel like I fit in. “Which I didn’t feel dating guys my age. I’ve gained a lot of confidence in myself.” However, the pair admitted they do face challenges because of their -year age gap but over the years, they have learnt how to make their relationship work, insisting how they are “best friends” before anything. Jason said: “We are so dferent. Almost too dferent to get bored of each other. Fingers crossed. “Also, we are truly best friends before anything. We’ve built a strong base for our relationship. It would take a lot for anyone to break us apart. “Azarel has a very strong personality so she can be a bit hard headed and snappy. But I know just how to ‘handle’ her. “Sometimes there’s stuff we obviously can’t relate about and the fact we are at dferent places in le. However, I don’t feel like any of that is a signicant dficulty.” Meanwhile, Azarel said: “Jason does small things like repeats everything he says to me x, and make phone calls in the car while I’m sleeping that can be very annoying.” The -year-old, who has just graduated from university with a bachelor’s degree, said that dating an older man feels much more stable than having two millennials trying to “figure out le” at the same time, which can bring added stress into a relationship. She said: “Not really, I think the relationship runs a little bit more smoothly because you don’t have two millennials trying to figure out le. When one of you are older, it feels a bit more stable.” Both Jason and Azarel’s family and friends are supportive of their relationship, though sometimes Jason receives the unsolicited advice to “watch out” when dating someone younger.

They sit with six players behind the ball and maybe cheat with a couple up the park and counter you well.“We need to find the answers to open teams up.”Dundee’s form going into last weekend’s clash with Caley Thistle was good with two wins and two draws in their previous four.However, consistency has consistently been the downfall for the Dark Blues this season.That four-game spell in December was their best since August and Hemmings knows it’s something the team have to improve on.He added: “We’re tired talking about it, to be honest.“We’ve had moments where we think we’re getting there and we’re away on a good run but have games like Inverness last week.“We can’t just do it for three or four games but we need seven or eight in a row to really assert ourselves.“The performances going back to the second half against Arbroath had been really good.“We’ve been positive in the way we’ve played, some good performances.“Last week was a chance to close the gap on Inverness and go level on points with them. It was disappointing in that regard.“This will be another big game because Ayr are a good team and we need to pick ourselves back up.”Tomorrow’s clash comes after tests against league leaders Dundee United, second-placed Inverness and ahead of a dficult Scottish Cup tie at home to high-flying Premiership side Motherwell.It’s a testing run for the players but Hemmings is relishing the chance to get back out and into a big match.He said: “It is good to have another big game this weekend.“We knew there were three big home games in a row with the Scottish Cup the week after.“That’s what you want – you always want to test yourself as a player.“It’s a good game to jump back into.”The last meeting with Ayr saw Dundee leave Somerset Park with an impressive - victory. That night saw plenty of tackles flying about and Hemmings expects no dferent this time around.“Whatever way they go, it’ll be a dficult game for us, we know that.“It was a tough game down there and a bit tasty as well – I expect the same this weekend.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.42352368-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.42352368-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.42352368-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.42352368-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dont blame snp for national divisions","story":"R Duncan claims the SNP is causing trouble with the English by wanting Independence .What it veries again is where British Nationalist hearts truly lie.

But there’s genuinely nothing imminent.”Despite no incomings being imminent, James is keen for fans of the club not to take that for inaction behind the scenes.He added: “We don’t want six or seven signings every window.

He’s training with the reserves at Hearts but there’s nothing happening with that. Will it  I’m genuinely not sure.“Wighty got put to us at the start of the season.

My opinion hasn’t changed – I think he will be. That’s how I’ve felt all along unless something drastically changes.“I hope that’s not my heart ruling my head.“He’s been really professional in the way he’s dealt with it.“He’s an experienced player with good character. He still looks very committed in training.“He’s key to what we’re trying to do but we knew when we signed him that this might happen.“We’re prepared for whatever happens.

I said as much to our players so we are not taking positives from that.“We have been here before and come back from a poor performance before. We need to do it again.“We can’t afford to be so up and down as a team.”The majority of Dundee’s low points this season have come on their own patch.The poor defeat to Inverness added to a list that includes bad days as hosts to Dundee United, Partick, Queen of the South and League Two Elgin City.However, James doesn’t feel there is an issue for players playing at Dens Park.“I was never big on that,” he added. “I didn’t feel that as a player. vw, px\"  “The basic thing that supporters want to see is people going out there and working hard.“For  to  minutes, Inverness were much better than us and, by then, the game was effectively done as far as they were concerned as they had a lead and sat back off the match.“They were right to do that and it happened up there as well. They are really good at it.“You know that teams come here and look to get through the first  minutes or so and look to get the crowd turned against us.“That happens at clubs that have quite a bit of support.“But I genuinely don’t buy into the view that there is this big stigma or a big problem about playing at Dens.“I don’t get it and it should be the opposite because when you get it right and you get the fans right behind you it is a really good place to play.“It flips and becomes a good place to play football.“The atmosphere can be really good but I have said it before and I will say it again – we need to give them something back.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

A -minute closure would cause chaos and massive tailbacks.“Major arterial road being erted on to a B-class and then a C-class road – unheard of!“Closing that road could potentially have traffic tailing back towards the AWPR junction – Transport Scotland would have something to say about that.“It is a terrible idea.”The officer said the required road closure would not be granted and added: “Aberdeenshire Council has already rejectedout of hand.”Another planning condition is bus lay-bys must be installed, but the club now wants to remove them so gaps in guard rails do not encourage rogue pedestrian crossing.However, in the meeting summary, an Aberdeen City Council officer said: “These proposals are not acceptable from a public transport perspective.“The lay-bys and bus stops are required to future-proof the site to prepare for any changes to public transport operations that could be made in the future and on this basis the planning condition should not be amended.”An Aberdeen City Council spokesman said, while it has met with civil engineering firm Fairhurst to discuss the proposals, it has not received a formal application to change the conditions at this time.A

residents and the wider community.“It is important to stress that safe and easy access and minimal disruption to the local community will be uppermost in the development of these solutions and in our

late search to line up another team.The friendly was officially confirmed just  hours before kick-off due to logistical reasons that Gunn admits became stressful.Gunn said: “It’s been stressful at times because you want it done in advance of travelling.“However because I’ve been through this a number of times where games have been confirmed late on, I was confident we’d get one that was

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer.

Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

on bad parking at the free site near to Tesco in Haddington town centre.The move follows a controversial bid by the local authority to introduce a new alternative car park outside the town centre.A bid for a ldquotransportation hub to the east of the town was put forward last month and sparked an angry reaction from town centre traders, who fear it will put people off shopping in the centre.The council has launched a public consultation on Haddington town centre parking and transportation and this included an exhibition which showed images of people parking outwithallocated spaces in the current -space long-stay car park which is linked to Tescorsquos own short-stay customer car park.Under the heading ldquoindiscriminate parking, the images showed cars and vans parked on kerb corners and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

They must remain with the UK parliament, the same way defence must remain, the same way foreign policy must remain.\"It would be wrong for us to give the right to the Scottish Parliament to set the referendums and the context and the timings whenever they wanted for the simple reason that Scotland would then be plunged into neverendums, and thatrsquos not good for us, not good for the economy. ldquoAskedthat was what the Prime Minister would tell Ms Sturgeon this week, Mr Jack said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon has said she fully expects a rebuttal from the Prime Minister to her letter.ldquoMy advice to him is certainly to say that.He went on: ldquoWe have a mandate to say No to a second independence referendum because the Edinburgh Agreement [paving the way for the  referendum] was signed in  by Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond.\"In that agreement it said both parties will uphold the result of the referendum and respect it. They havenrsquot respected the result of the  referendum and they havenrsquot respected the result of the  one.In fact, the Edinburgh Agreement does not include a cast-iron commitment by the Scottish Government to uphold and respect the result, but a more ambiguous aspiration that the result will be fair and clear enough to command respect.The text states the UK and Scottish ldquogovernments are agreed that the referendum shouldhellip deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect.The governments also ldquolook forward to a referendum that is legal and fair producing a decisive and respected outcome.But the SNP could still argue that, despite those high hopes, respect for the result has proved ephemeral because of Brexit.Mr Jackrsquos ruling out of a Section  order eventhere is another SNP majority at Holyrood is a complete reversal of Mr Jackrsquos position in November.Then, he was askedthe SNP winning most of Scotlandrsquos  seats in the general election would give it a democratic mandate for a Section  order, and replied: ldquoNo.Asked why not, he said: ldquoBecause the democratic mandate for a Section  order is a matter for .

The fastest application to date still took  days.ldquoThis needs to be looked at.Despite creating the legislation which gave rise to it, the Scottish Government said the Tribunal was an independent independent judicial body and the Lord President, as the head of the judiciary, was responsible for its operation.A spokesperson said: ldquoMinisters have taken signicant action to increase security and stability for those living in the private rented sector, including protection from unlawful eviction and wrongful terminations.ldquoWe recognise that rent arrears can be a serious concern for landlords and agree that landlords must be able to recover possession of their property when they follow the correct legal procedures for eviction.ldquoHowever, the Scottish Government considers it entirely appropriate that when seeking to evict someone from their home, this should be done following a fair judicial process."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-demand-fair-budget-snp","story":"In a campaign launched today, the council umbrella body Cosla warns more investment is needed in hard-pressed local services ldquobefore it is too late.It accuses SNP ministers of both skimping on their funding and burdening councils with nationally-directed duties.In , only  per cent of council spending was in lsquoprotected areasrsquo such as education and social work.Last year, more than % was in areas protected by central government, forcing councils to find savings in the other %.Cosla said that meant disproportionate cuts in roads, economic planning and culture and leisure.With another poundm ring-fenced in -, it said an extra poundbn of revenue and poundm of capital spending was vital.Cosla president Alison Evison said: ldquoIn recent budgets the Scottish Government has chosen to overlook the essential services that communities rely on day in, day out.ldquoIf we are to truly realise Scotlandrsquos potential then local authorities must receive a fair settlement.The Government said: ldquoThe failure of the UK Government to publish its budget at an earlier time means we do not have clarity on the funding available for our schools, hospitals and other vital public services.ldquoDespite this, we remain focused on introducing a Scottish budget for - at the earliest practical opportunity, and are in discussions with Cosla on how we can support their budget process.ldquoDespite further cuts to the Scottish Budget from the UK Government, we have ensured our partners in local government receive fair funding - delivering a funding package of pound.bn for all local authorities in  , which is a real terms increase of more than pound million.ldquoWhile ring-fenced funding is for increased investment in services such as our schools and nurseries, local authorities have complete autonomy to allocate over % - pound.bn - of the funding we provide, plus all locally raised income.ldquoDecisions on budget allocations for future years are subject to the outcome of the current negotiations with Cosla.ldquoThe results will be confirmed as part of the Budget in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"flights-delayed-plane-bursts-tyre-landing-glasgow-airport","story":"The \"technical issue\" left a runway blocked and forced at least one flight into a holding pattern.The airport fire service attended the plane and passengers disembarked once it was safe to do so.: Megxit means Megxit - its time to abolish the monarchyA spokesman for the airport said the runway has now been cleared.He added: \"An easyJet aircraft arriving from Malaga suffered a technical issue on landing.

It is  miles from Scotgoldrsquos site at Cononish near Tyndrum which is preparing to begin full-scale mining operations at what will be Scotlandrsquos first commercial gold mine.Earlier this year Scotgold also revealed soil samples from the hills of Glen Fyne close to the village of Cairndow had revealed ldquoexciting, new and potentially signicant results, with gold showing signs of being three times better than anticipated, and the silver almost twice as good.That area, which is said to be around two miles long, has been placed as a ldquohigh priority for further sampling with a view to eventually extracting the gold and silver reserves.The mine at Cononish produced gold for the first time in August  following the launch of an ore processing trial. Scotgold Resources has plans to re-open an old mine shaft and extract more than half a million tonnes of mineral ore, along with up to , tonnes of rock.Work will see a m tunnel dug as part of the initial exploration of the area expanded to stretch  metres deep into the hillside. The mine will then spiral m back up towards the surface.Itrsquos expected the mine will produce around , ounces of gold throughout its letime which, at current gold prices of pound an ounce, would place its value at over pound million. However, the actual value could be even higher once a premium is added for its rarity value.News of gold-digging operations has inspired a mini lsquogold rushrsquo among iniduals seeking glittering treasure in rivers and burns. Meanwhile earlier this month it emerged that a -carat doughnut-shaped nugget said to be worth pound, was found in a Scottish river in May.The gold, which weighs a total of .g, was found in an undisclosed river by a er using a method known as ldquosniping, using a snorkel and hand tools to scour the riverbed.The find came a year after the discovery of an .g nugget valued at pound,. The exact locations of both finds have not been revealed.The Loch Tay project area is said to cover ldquohighly prospective ground within the Grampian Gold Belt. The region of Dalradian rocks hosts several signicant minerals and deposits of high-grade gold, base metals and baryte and stretches from Northern Ireland and across Scotland.A search for gold is also underway at Curraghinalt gold mine in the Tyrone County of Northern Ireland.Erris Resources will operate and manage the exploration programme. Erris Resources chief executive Anton Du Plessis said the Loch Tay sites were \"highly prospective\".He said: \"This gives us exposure to new gold targets that have not previously been tested, but which are located in the highly prospective Grampian gold belt that already hosts some important gold deposits, such as Curraghinalt, and Cononish, which is only  kms away and that aims to pour its first gold next year.\"Importantly, land access agreements have already been signed, which allow work to proceed on the priority targets with the aim of advancing exploration to drill target definition in .Erris Resources has a portfolio of zinc and base metals projects in Ireland and gold projects in Scandinavia.The investment in the Loch Tay area followed a review of  samples collected by GreenOre taken from the site to the southwest of Aberfeldy and close to the Loch Tay Fault.The samples are said to have yielded lsquohigh-grade goldrsquo.A statement from Erris Resources added that the business ldquobelieves that the Loch Tay Project has signicant potential for discovery of an economic gold resource."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10894159.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kirsty-strickland-race-lead-scottish-tories-matters","story":"Uncharitable souls might ask why it matters.For all the overblown rhetoric about a so-called lsquorsquoTory revivalrsquorsquo in Scotland, whoever emerges victorious is unlikely to become our next first minister.Boris Johnson now has a hefty parliamentary majority won outside of Scotland and in spite of Scotland.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities. A medical school located within the Highlands and Islands has the potential to attract larger numbers of doctors to study here and then, when they’re qualied, to encourage them to stay and work in our region.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But even before the election was called, Ms Ballantyne was getting around association meetings to raise her profile beyond the Borders in anticipation of a contest sooner or later. Her strong promise to the grassroots of more say to local associations has attracted plenty of support, including some of my Edinburgh Council colleagues, so a good contest is pretty much guaranteed.: The Conservatives have abandoned true conservatism for nationalism – Paris Gourtsoyannis: Alister Jack said he would fund breakaway Scottish Conservative PartyOf course, it’s all very well winning the contest, it’s what happens afterwards that matters and there is a very small window for the winner to settle in and produce a strategy that gives the party a realistic chance of overtaking the SNP as the biggest single party at the  Scottish elections. By the time the result is announced on February , there will be barely  months to go so realistically around seven months to prepare and agree a campaign.That process has been complicated by this week’s departure of strategy and communications chief Eddie Barnes, who planned to go shortly after Ruth Davidson’s decision to step down but agreed to stay on for the election campaign. The gap he leaves is not the only one from Ruth Davidson’s  high-point, with the previous departures of policy chief Marek Zemanic and the closest the Scottish Conservatives had to the left-field thinking power of Dominic Cummings, Kevin Ancell. So the new leader’s top priority is to assemble his or her version of that team, able to work effectively with whatever comes out of Mr Cummings’ Downing Street “weirdos and misfits” shake-up. Scottish party director Lord Mark McInnes and chairman Rab Forman have vital roles to play and both understand the political reality that the minute the contest is over the focus must be on the wider electorate, not party structures. Partly for this reason, it was accepted that turning Ruth Davidson’s succession into an argument about the Scottish party’s relationship with London would be disastrous. The membership is certainly anxious to be talking about new Conservative policies for the  campaign, an attractive, viable alternative programme for government, and for the  campaign not to rely solely on opposition to a second independence referendum.But the key lesson from the  triumph was the simplicity of the message and that campaign had learnt from the  disaster what look like detailed, credible and honest policies on paper can easily become electoral poison.There is more than enough in the SNP’s  years of government to attack without giving Nationalists the means to deflect criticism.We know from the  campaign in Scotland that those Conservatives who turned away did so because they didn’t like Boris Johnson or Brexit or both, but in a dferent context would . The context in  will indeed be dferent Brexit will be done and, like it or not, the election will be about a second independence referendum first and foremost, then the SNP’s record.Cynical though it may seem, details of what the new leader would like to dohe or she is First Minister come after understanding what it will take to win. And sticking to it.Downing Street’s pointless fight with Scottish PressAt a time of unprecedented political change and the perpetual turmoil of the digital communications revolution, the desire of the new UK Government to “slaughter sacred cows” is recognition that so many of the old ways of doing things are no longer suitable. In looking for places to start, Downing Street has chosen what it probably regarded as a soft target by switching the twice-daily official briefings for the Westminster Lobby correspondents from their offices above the Commons to  Downing Street.It’s not dficult to see why this wasn’t thought to be much of a problem because the list of registered Lobby journalists is dominated by heavy representation from the big news organisations  from the BBC alone,  from the , The Sun eight and even the weekly Spectator magazine lists three.Beyond Fleet Street, the Scottish Press is the best-represented group, with staff from this paper, the Herald, Daily Record, The Courier and the Aberdeen Press  Journal, but with only the one from each they will have to dash from the Commons to Downing Street, get through the security gate and into Number  and then the same in reverse to catch whatever business is going on in the House.It’s a needless inconvenience and a reasonable compromise of having the morning brief in Downing Street but the afternoon session kept in the Lobby has been mooted. With the Scottish election looming and a new Scottish leader to bed in, whatever holy cattle are headed for the abattoir, Downing Street shouldn’t pick pointless fights with the Scottish Press.Free trade or holidays Much of Scotland’s global reputation for being lovers of hard drink is based not just on the whisky business but on the bacchanalian revelry which surrounds Hogmanay, to the extent that two bank holidays are needed for the hangover while the rest of the UK gets by with one.But for the newspaper business, January  is a normal publishing day, bringing readers news of the celebrations, the New Year babies, previews of sports fixtures and such like and in the internet age that won’t change.But now it seems First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is set to back a campaign by the shop workers union Usdaw to ban bigger shops from opening on Ne’er Day which would all but wipe out hard copy sales which remain vital to an industry already under severe financial pressures.Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says it’s to allow retail staff to spend more time with their families, but it’s just another excuse for government to interfere with free trade.John McLellan is a Conservative councillor in Edinburgh©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted remote scottish island seeks manager to bring in tourists to forgotten isle","story":"A tiny Scottish island with a population of six people is advertising for a manager to draw in more tourists.The community owned island of Ulva in the Inner Hebrides is looking for a project manager to develop a heritage visitor centre at the former Lairds house, Ulva House.The North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which owns Ulva, is advertising the job which pays between £, and £,.: The faces of some of Edinburgh’s earliest inhabitants revealedThe job ad states: \"The objectives of the acquisition are to manage the island to provide sustainable benefits with a focus on repopulation and ensuring community ownership delivers benefits for the wider North West Mull area as well as the island itself.\"Since coming into community ownership work has been progressing on several key projects, one of which is the refurbishment and repurposing of the former Lairds House, Ulva House, as a heritage visitor centre with associated self-catering accommodation.\"To this end the company are seeking to appoint an ambitious and experienced project manager.\"More than  people expressed an interest in living on Ulva last year after being bought by islanders who secured up to £. million in funds from the Scottish Land Fund.If all were selected to become islanders it would represent around a , per cent rise in the existing population on the ,-acre island.: Ask the historians: Who was the cruellest figure in Scottish history The job advert adds: \"Ulvas people have inspiring and engaging stories to tell, including that of Lachlan Macquarie - the Founding Father of modern Australia.\"He achieved great success and his influence lives on and is celebrated today.\"However of the thousands of other people who left Ulva, voluntarily or forced, there are other stories of the famous, infamous and not famous - that deserve to be told.\"The focus of the project will be telling the stories of six or so key Ulva iniduals.\"Who they were, set in the context of their times, the impact they had on Ulva and, as they left, the impact they had on the place they went to.\"There are some obvious stories - such as Lachlan Macquarie and one of the Clarks - the Clearance lairds.\"However there will be others, discovered through research, that will tell the story of their time - what it was like to live on Ulva and like to leave Ulva.\"Initial research has already identied a number of interesting characters that need to be explored further.\"The closing date for applications is January  and the job is from March to November .©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence uk government s opposition to indyref2 unsustainable","story":"The UK Governments blanket opposition to a second referendum on Scottish independence is not sustainable and will eventually crumble, senior SNP figures have predicted.Holyrood constitutional affairs spokesman Mike Russell described the argument against an IndyRef put forward by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack yesterday as \"bogus\".Mr Jack used a Sunday television interview to rule out a further plebiscite on the constitution - eventhe SNP was ed to power at next years Scottish parliamentary elections with a majority.

These could include a commemorative coin and Big Ben ringing out.One of the items is likely to be a fund from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government to help councils and other groups buy and display the Union Flag. A Westminster source said: “It’s prompted by Brexit but is also meant to celebrate national identity more broadly.”The move has been promoted by senior Tory backbencher Sir John Hayes, who said in the Commons last week that flying the UK flag from public buildings “would be a fitting tribute to the decision the British people made to leave the European Union”. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay replied: “Any opportunity to do so is one that he and I would always celebrate.”But the move was criticised by SNP foreign affairs spokesman Alyn Smith, who said: “The Tories have completely lost the plot.“Boris Johnson is asking councils in Scotland to celebrate the fact that jobs and businesses in their local community will be wiped out thanks to Brexit. “Brexit will be catastrophic for Scotland’s economy, leaving every single person in Scotland worse off. “We voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and we’ve rejected Brexit at every election since – yet the Tories are going to drag Scotland out of Europe against our will. “But let’s be clear, voters will be given the chance to escape this madness and build a fairer Scotland with a fresh referendum on our future.” One group of Conservative MPs is lobbying the government to ensure that Big Ben, which is silent for building work, rings out at pm on  January, the precise moment the UK is no longer a member of the EU.Strident Brexiteer Mark Francois is leading efforts to get the bell restarted. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has said he would back the scheme as long as MPs voted in favour, while pro-Brexit businessman Lord Ashcroft has offered to foot the £, cost.A Downing Street spokesman insisted that no final decisions had been made on how \u2028 January will be marked. Some in the government are nervous about holding too many flashy events in case it alienates people who voted Remain.One idea suggested by ministers would have seen pubs allowed to stay open later so that drinkers could stay up and celebrate, but the plan was scrapped because it was too dficult to put in place at short notice.Nigel Farage is backing a “Brexit Celebration” event hosted by Leave Means Leave in Parliament Square which is expected to attract thousands of supporters and will feature speechs by senior Brexiteers.The original date on which Britain was scheduled to leave the EU,  March, , saw two rallies outside the House of Parliament – one featuring mainstream politicians and the other organised by the far-right and including Tommy Robinson, which ended up with clashes between police and protesters.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish citylink offering free bus travel on services between edinburgh and glasgow this weekend","story":"The coach operator is allowing customers to travel free of charge on the  service between Glasgow and Edinburgh on Saturday  and Sunday  January - but they must book online to take advantage of the deal.Free travel dealThe free travel deal is available for single,or daytickets, and comes in celebration of Scottish Citylink’s new fleet of vehicles operating on the  service, representing an investment of £ million.The operator has introduced  new state-of-the-art luxury double decker coaches this month on the route between Glasgow and Edinburgh, which operates up to every  minutes,  hours a day.The new coaches have also boosted capacity by  per cent, adding more than , extra seats each day to the route.Greater comfort for customersThe new Plaxton Panorama coaches have  seats and offer customers greater comfort levels, with more leg room and on-board amenities, including fold-down tables, reading lights, mobile device holders, and USB and wireless chargers at every seat.On the lower deck, seating is provided around two tables with integrated wireless device charging, and customers can also enjoy improved luggage capacity in the new vehicles.The  service is delivered jointly on behalf of Scottish Citylink by Stagecoach West Scotland and Parks of Hamilton, and delivers a step up on luxury to offer improved comfort and enjoyment for journeys.Robert Andrew, Stagecoach regional director for Scotland said, “Millions of people use our services between Glasgow and Edinburgh every year and we’re delighted to have launched these fantastic new vehicles, which offer greater comfort and style than ever before.“To help celebrate this investment, and the fact that we are now offering more seats than ever on this route, we have decided to offer free travel on the  service this weekend.“We hope this offer will benefit those who regularly use our service and encourage some new customers to give coach travel a try.”How to claim the offerTo take advantage of the offer, customers simply need to book their travel in advance online by visiting citylink.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"strike action looms at sullom voe ","story":"Industrial action could soon be on the cards at Sullom Voe Terminal after union Unite announced it will ballot its members.This follows talks with EnQuest on terms and conditions, including pensions.In a consultative ballot held over the festive period,  per cent of Unite members voted to reject EnQuest’s proposed changes to terms and conditions on a  per cent turnout.Unite launched the ballot to coincide with the end of a y internal dispute process involving the union and the company, which has produced no agreement.John Clark, Unite regional industrial officer, said: #Unite will now move forward with an industrial action ballot at Sullom Voe which we have received a resounding mandate for from our membership.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/visitor-web.jpg","title":"oidhche challain no admission without a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is a pitch-black night in a west coast village  years ago, the night of the  January: New Year according to the Julian calendar still followed by older people in the community, even though it was superseded by the more accurate Gregorian calendar a century ago.Suddenly the silence is broken by a cacophony of shouting boys, and the pandemonium is taken up by dogs barking all over the village. depending on where you are – has begun.Gangs of boys in masks and white clothes roam from house to house.

Two other swimmers making their yearly pilgrimage were Arthur Chatfield from Scotland and Alan Traynor from Donegal.Several families also participated and among them were, the Eddie and Scott Gilmore, Simon and Chole Murphy, Darren and Curtis Donnell, Alister and Laurie Neeson, Anthony and Paul O’Rawe, Brian Lemon and Son Brian, Robert, Matthew, Sarah and Joy Bowman, Andrew and William Knox and David and Naomi Morrow. With the favourable weather it was a great day for the number of new first-time swimmers and in particular the young people taking part along with the usual stalwarts.With everyone back on terra firma and changed they made their way to the Bridge Inn to get fed and watered prior to the social festivities taking place. Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past. Last year the swim raised the magnicent sum of pound and this year again has got off to a brilliant start with pound being lted on the day thanks to the generous sponsorship from the general public. The social festivities got off to a good start with Bert Kernohan carrying out the duties of compere and the music being supplied by Two Star Country. The Choir Challenge followed with the ladies out to regain their crown which they had lost last year. They went first conducted by Dana Kernohan setting a very high standard for the judge Billy McIlroy. The men followed and put on a wonderful performance under the leadership of Bert Kernohan.In judging Billy said he had to apply the “Var” as used in football and on this the better harmonising by the ladies gave them the win by the slimmest of margins which was received with rapturous applause.Next year will be the th anniversary of the event which will be a Major Milestone in its history.The Chairman thanked everyone who in any way assisted in helping to make the event the success that it was.The swim took place under the watchful eye of Larne Branch St Johns Ambulance, East Antrim R.N.L.I., Kayakers Jim Mulvenna, Marion O’Dornan and her sister Claire Corr. The organisers of the swim would like to thank Andrew McAlister and his team from Mid and East Antrim Council who installed safety barriers around the harbour and were responsible for the overall safety of everyone as well as Events Insurance Company in England who provided the Public Liability Insurance Cover required to allow the event to take place, Larne branch of the Saint John’s Ambulance and Carnlough Rowing Club for the use of their Clubhouse.In addition they would like to thank Mr Paul McWilliams Proprietor of Galgorm Trophies who supplied the Swimmers Mementoes, Ballymena Business Equipment Larne Street Ballymena who supplied the certicates, Darren and Sabrina Donnell and Family for the Harbour collection which raised pound., Darren Donnell and Anne Ryan who organised the raffle, The Associations Mothers Committee and Friends who donated the prizes which raised pound., Spud Murphy and family who donated and organised, Nearest Coin to the Litre bottle of Smirnoff which raised the Sum of pound inside ten minutes , Myrtle Taylor Treasurer and Sharon Smyth Committee Member for the registration of swimmers and completion of the certicates and Sharon who also organised the presentation of raffle prizes and James Henry and staff Broughshane Street Ballymena who provided the transport and chaperoned the swimmers from the Seven Towers Leisure Centre Ballymena to Carnlough Anyone who was unable to attend the presentation in the Bridge Inn to receive their Certicate and Medal please contact Billy McIlroy on .

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"orange order says no to new decade new approach deal","story":"ORANGE Order leaders have fired a shot across the DUP bows with a no-holds-barred attack on the #New Decade, New Approach# deal tabled last night by the Irish and British governments.Previously, Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson had warned the DUP that any concession on an Irish Language Act would be fiercely opposed by Orangemen.#In contrast to the detailed list of measures to promote the Irish language, references to Ulster-Scots Ulster-British culture are ambiguous # lacking meaningful detail or delivery mechanisms,# said a statement from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. #Indeed, many of the initiatives are merely reworking of previous undelivered commitments to our community. As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

And while there is a lull in December, we are blessed in that our weekends are the same all the year round.\"Weekdays are quieter, but we have found the quiet season has been getting shorter and there is something on in Portrush from Easter to October.\"The key to surviving is the ability to adapt to the winter to get you through the lean times, but we use the winter months to get ready for the summer season.\"A visit to Portrush conjures thoughts of sunny days, ice cream and fun day trips.On the day of our visit, though, a chilly breeze is coming off the sea. Whereas in summer people amble through the streets, today they are keen to escape the winter elements.For some, the dawn of a new year is bringing uncertainty.Despite having his own unique selling point of exquisite afternoon teas set in the most delightfully quaint tea shop, William McKittricks Panky Doos is at risk of closing.Summer  brought an unprecedented level of development to Portrush in preparation for The Open golf championship and with it road closures and ersions, which resulted in a drop in footfall.This, ahead of the dficult winter season, proved to be too much for Mr McKittrick and his we, who poured their savings into Panky Doos, leaving them with no choice but to put their business up for sale.He said: \"Last year the town was closed down for five months to redevelop it for The Open. \"Our business has become collateral damage because people stayed away because they couldnt get into the town.\"We caught up a bit over the summer but because the summer season was shorter we are now % down compared with the last three winters.\"Winter is a tough time but we have a niche in that we offer afternoon teas, and although I have lots of bookings for them, I am too far behind to keep going.\"This is breaking our heart, we would love to stay here. We knew coming into this that business is seasonal and for the first three winters things worked out great.\"In fact, even now I have bookings for over  afternoon teas that will take us right up to March, but unfortunately because of the impact of the development for The Open, we have been forced to put the business up for sale.\"Winter or summer, the leboat station in Portrush is ever ready. While the number of call-outs at this time will be fewer, when the calls do come their very nature brings challenges.Karl ONeill is a lead leguard superviser in Portrush and a volunteer RNLI leboat crew member. He said: \"Winter or summer we operate a -hour service, but in the wintertime our callouts tend to be commercial fishing vessels that have lost power and take a bit longer, we are out in a bit more swell, rougher seas.\"Portrush is very popular with local surfers, body-boarders and stand-up paddle boarders throughout the year, so it is not out of the ordinary for us to get calls to help people who have gotten into dficulties or injured themselves.\"Safety is paramount for our crews and we strap ourselves to our seats, but in the wintertime you definitely need a strong stomach because we can be out in very dficult conditions and at times we could be out for anything up to  hours.\"The personal protection equipment the RNLI provide is second to none so the cold temperatures dont tend to be a problem.\"I have been a volunteer for  years now, and to be honest when the pager goes off, evenit is cold and wet, I just get on with it.\"While the weather has a big impact on the day-to-day lives of traders and those working for the RNLI, local people out walking said winter brings a dferent vibe to Portrush, which isnt necessarily a bad thing.Among them are Edwina and Trevor Milliken, who visit Portrush two or three times a week during the winter.Edwina said: \"Portrush is beautul even in the winter and a great place to come to enjoy the fresh air and sea walks and the scenery is beautul.\"We walk right up to Ramore Head and back, which would be a good hours walk, but we call in for lunch in one of the many restaurants.\"James Marshall from Cullybackey has had a caravan in Portrush since  and takes full advantage of that, no matter what the season is.He said: \"Summers in Portrush are great and we wouldnt think of going anywhere . Our caravan looks out to the sea and that is a view that never gets boring, winter or summer.\"Summer is great but it is nice here in the winter too because it is a wee bit quieter, there is just something about Portrush that draws us here, no matter what time of the year.\"A few miles down the road in Portstewart, at the renowned Morellis ice-cream parlour restaurant, the huge queues that stretch out on to the street at the height of summer have disappeared as the temperature has dropped. Manager Amy Platt said: \"In the summer it is literally mayhem here, people are queued out the door and right up the street and that continues right up to  oclock at night.\"There are days we cant even see out to the street because there are so many people, so it is very dferent to how things are in the winter months.\"Our quiet time is getting shorter and shorter and I would say the season now runs from March or April right up to October.\"The two weeks before Christmas is the quietest time of the year for us but then theres Boxing Day, which is like a busy Saturday at the height of summer.\"I think by that stage people want to get out for a walk and they call in for an ice-cream and a coffee. January is another dead time for us, but thats always the way.\"Maureen McDowell is a lelong resident of Portstewart and, along with her friend Joy Cromie, has never lost the joy she feels walking along the promenade of her home town.She said: \"Portstewart is a great place no matter what time of the year, but I do prefer the buzz of the summertime. But the number of people coming here in the wintertime is growing and I think thats because of the number of coffee shops that have opened and stay open in the evening.\"It used to be in winter it was very dead, but thats changing.\""},{"url":null,"title":"florence pugh sam mendes and anthony hopkins among oscar nominees","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

are likely to be discussed at Sandringham..push– FundingThis is one of the most contentious issues.Harry and Meghan want to be financially independent and earn their own money, but still say they will be supporting the Queen in their duties.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in February  The Prince of Wales currently pays for most of their official duties and some of their private costs through his £ million a year Duchy of Cornwall income, but will this continue Taxpayers foot the bill for official travel through the Sovereign Grant, but will the taxpayer have to pay as Harry and Meghan travel to and from North America as they carry out private work to earn their own income.Will the taxpayer still pay for travel on official tours,there are any – SecurityThe Sussexes’ website indicates British taxpayers will still have to cover the cost of their police protection officers.But only senior royals tend to get police protection, so should the public still have to pay for Harry and Meghan’s police guards \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Prince of Wales, the Queen, the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge will meet on Monday The Duke of York now pays for Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie’s security after facing many years of criticism because they were not working royals.Frequent travel between North America and the UK will also require additional security, and will the British taxpayers have to pay for Archie’s security as well as he grows up What will the cost be of guarding Frogmore Cottage when it stands empty, and the same for a property abroad Will the Canadians or the US,they move there, have to contribute to the security costs  How will this be split How will Harry, Meghan and Archie’s security be ensuredthey do not use highly trained police protection officers, and drivers – Official dutiesThe prospect of dual roles as royals who earn private money is fraught with problems.Royal financial expert David McClure described it as a “toxic mix”.Harry and Meghan say they want “to carve out a progressive new role within this institution”.But they have been accused of going rogue and trying to rip up the royal book which has evolved over hundreds of years.Questions that need answers include:– What official engagements will Harry and Meghan carry out and how many – What proportion of their time will be spent on royal duties, and what will happen to their Commonwealth roles, their charities and their patronages – How will they ensure there is not a conflict of interest between their royal duties and their private work – Cashing in on royal statusOne of the major problems for royals earning their own money is being accused of cashing in on royal status.The Countess of Wessex and Sarah, Duchess of York faced such problems, with Sophie in the end quitting her PR business to become a full-time royal instead.Royal aides will have to look at how to avoid Harry and Meghan being accused of profiting financially from their royal connections.– Homes in relation to Frogmore House on the Windsor Estate \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Frogmore Cottagein relation to Frogmore House on the Windsor Estate The duke and duchess plan to split their time between the UK and North America – presumably Canada, or Calornia where Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lives – but how will their transatlantic lestyle work Their website says they will continue to live at Frogmore Cottage.But presumably the Queen, who gave permission for the couple to use the home as their official residence, will still agree to this.They will also need a base in North America, but who will pay for this property Will taxpayers have to refurbish this home because Harry and Meghan are still members of the royal family, or will they pay for it themselves Frogmore Cottage was also renovated at a cost of £. million by the taxpayer, with more costs likely to be published in the royal accounts this summer.Royal aides could even face calls from the taxpayers for Harry and Meghan to repay this money.When Windsor Castle caught fire in , public opinion had turned against the royals amid fears that taxpayers would have to foot the bill for the castle’s repairs.In the end, the Queen agreed to pay % of the £. million costs by opening Buckingham Palace to the public for the first time to generate extra income.It was also announced that she would pay income tax for the first time and cut down the size of the Civil List.– Work\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex leaving after their visit to Canada House Royal aides will want to know what sort of private work Harry and Meghan are considering and whether it will be beyond reproach, with the reputation of the royal family at stake.Ato acting for former Suits star Meghan, who quit ahead of her wedding, is thought unlikely, but nothing seems off the table at the moment.Harry and Meghan are planning to launch their Sussex Royal Foundation with a global reach.Who will pay for this and do they plan to earn money from this charitable venture and,so, how will this be justied Could the couple be considering earning an income from television work, motivational lectures, or autobiographical or children’s books Meghan ran her own lestyle blog before marrying into the royals so could be thinking of bringing back the thetig.Harry is a former soldier, but has no fallback profession and has not worked in private employment.– CitizenshipWhat will happen with Meghan’s citizenship, and Archie’s, and does Harry have the right to work in the US or Canada, or stay there long term At the time of their engagement, Kensington Palace said Meghan would be applying for British citizenship, but it was not known whether she would hold dual American citizenship.Questions will also arise as to where the couple will pay tax on their income, and how their finances will be scrutinised.– Carbon footprintHarry and Meghan faced criticism for their use of private jets over the summer, but their transatlantic travel could again raise issues about their carbon footprint."},{"url":null,"title":"dog reunited with owner after

Michelle Southern, the charity’s founder, said: “Rooney’s story has really touched the hearts of the nation, but sadly it’s not uncommon.

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown, the Moderator of the Derry and Donegal Presbytery, Rev Colin McKibbin, and the Methodist Superintendent, Rev’d Richard Johnston, also took part.The Lord Lieutenant of the City of Londonderry, Dr Angela Garvey, Deputy Lieutenant Mrs Stella Burnside , former Lord Lieutenant for the County, Sir Denis Desmond, the Duke of Abercorn and the Deputy Mayor, Cllr Cara Hunter, were in the congregation. Also present were Lord Hay of Ballyore, Dame Mary Peters, former PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Peter Sheridan, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell, Sinn Feacutein MEP Martina Anderson, former SDLP leader Mark Durkan, Mrs Pat Hume, former Church of Ireland Primate Most Rev’d Alan Harper and the Bishop of Mahajanga in Madagascar, Rt Rev’d Hall Speers. The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Rev’d Richard Clarke, was unable to attend in person and Bishop Andrew Forster read out a tribute from Dr Clarke in which he described Bishop Mehaffey as “a powerful influence for good”. “Of course, we all have our own inidual memories of Jim,” the Archbishop said, “but all of us will recall with particular admiration his work – in company with Bishop Edward Daly – not only for peace but also for reconciliation in this city. “Together they brought hope and light into communities where there was precious little of either. We all saw in Bishop Jim a gracious composure coupled with a steely resolve – the sense that this work for peace and harmony between communities so long ided was work for the Kingdom of God, and it would not be thwarted, from whatever quarter.” googletag.cmd.push HallmarkThe address in the Service was delivered by the Rt Rev’d The Lord Eames, another former Primate of the Church of Ireland, who recalled Dr Mehaffey’s advice to colleagues on the Church of Ireland’s Priorities Committee to remember why they were there. “If there is a hallmark as he moved to this city to be your Bishop,” Lord Eames said, “ there is a hallmark that I would have as part of his legacy, it is those words: ‘Hold on, you’ve lost sight of why we’re here.’ You’ve lost sight that the reconciliation in our community which was so fostered by Edward Daly and James Mehaffey must never be lost sight of. “You’ve lost sight of the wonderful rewards of reconciliation or in reaching out hands of friendship. And within the Church, you’ve lost sight at times of your roots – the roots that have given you the commission of God to be alive for all sorts and conditions of people.“For Bishop Jim, this was his priority as he worked with Edward and other leaders to bind up the broken, to heal the wounds of the lost, to make people remember why you’re here, that in the short gt of a lespan you must grasp every opportunity to do things for the good of all – across the barriers, across the river and across the isions.“This was his ministry as a Bishop. It was a ministry exercised in those dark days of suffering, misunderstanding, suspicion and it was a ministry which was being true to the commission given to him in September : ‘Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken, bring again the outcasts, seek the lost.’”Before the Service, Bishop Mehaffey’s we, Thelma, their daughter Wendy and son Tim welcomed the many hundreds of people from across the community who had come to sympathise with the family in their loss. And Wendy read out an emotional tribute to her father, during which she spoke of her love and gratitude to her “beautul dad”.She said her father’s love of people came into its own after he was appointed Bishop, as he sought friendships across the city. There was challenge in this role, Wendy said, but he remained steadfast in his belief and faith. “During his last spell in hospital,” she said, “there was a day when, in a moment of brilliant and characteristic clarity, Dad said: ‘One helps the other.’ May that be the profound message that we each take away from our gathering today.”Bishop Mehaffey’s remains will repose in St Columb’s Cathedral until Monday morning when they will be taken to Belfast for cremation. googletag.cmd.push   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its strategic plan centres around funding for the Greater Belfast Development with no mention of its Magee or Coleraine campuses which have witnessed student numbers drop signicantly in the past five years. The University’s most recent Financial Statement for  , outlines its long-term financial strategy. UU’s five-year strategic plan ‘Five and Fty’ sets the vision and mission of the University. It states: “As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive.” googletag.cmd.push It details ambitions to deliver an “operating surplus” to support a sustainable investment strategy in both the University’s physical resources and information technology facilities. This includes the generation of “sufficient cash reserves” to allow for the allocation of poundm per annum to capital projects of which poundm per annum is towards the Greater Belfast Development and the repayment of loans to fund this project. A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has urged UU to immediately hand over its lands to city-region, saying: UU is demonstrating all the hallmarks of a struggling multi-national business running down a neglected outpost. Ulster needs to hand over the lands and budgets at Magee to the city-region immediately to allow us to develop university provision here autonomously. Ultimately, we can sit and watch UU die slowly in the regions while it moves to Belfast, or we can take proper control of the situation ourselves and start building for the future, with a vengeance. googletag.cmd.push The idea of Council partnering in a multi-million pounds development City Deal with organisation such as UU is frankly ludicrous. Imagine you were about to invest poundm and performed due diligence on your partners and found out they had UUs record. You would leave the table immediately. Council must do likewise. Signicant problems The University’s approved financial strategy aimed to ensure the financial viability of UU. Any borrowings were not to exceed that approved in the Business Plan for the Greater Belfast Development and any other projects that may arise which are confirmed as self-funding. The strategy also aimed to support the development of activities that generate income for growth. However, since the   financial statement was published the Northern Ireland Audit Office released a report showing that the Greater Belfast Development has encountered signicant problems, and delays, meaning it now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap. It is anticipated to run poundm over budget. The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing poundm capital grant. UU has earmarked cash reserves of poundm built up since , to support the project and committed a further pound million over the next three years. This is over and above the pound.m spent by UU to date. The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound.m including  per cent VAT which is irrecoverable.

Philip ODoherty has increased the managers budget signicantly, by %, ahead of this season, and the manager admitted his delight at having that extra support ahead of what he and the fans hope will be a successful season. “The budget is key, absolutely, but at the same time Shamrock Rovers probably had one of the biggest budgets in the league last year, they won the FAI Cup and they continue to get better.“Of course, as a manager, you want a few extra pound to spend but we’ve got to strive both on and off the pitch to get this place better.“When you have the backing of a chairman who loves the place, that’s key to the whole process. In my opinion there wouldn’t be a Derry City Football Club without Philip O’Doherty because of his business sense and his investment over the years has been invaluable.“He rescued the club when it went out of business. He’s not just a guy who is throwing money at the football club, he’s a man who cares for the city. He cares for the people in the city. He’s a very proud Derry man andwe all took a leaf out of Philip O’Doherty’s book we’d be in a very good place.“He cares and backs it up. He invests in people and structures and employs a lot of people in the city. I, for one, hold him in the highest esteem for what he does for the people of Derry and for the football club. It should never be taken for granted.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The result is Belfast: City of Light, a new book in which she shares her experiences and asks some pertinent questions on matters of faith and beliefs.Bronagh began her journey as a non-churchgoer. Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast. At the same time she explored her own upbringing during the Troubles and heard many stories from people in Belfast of experience she only saw on TV growing up and often switched off in horror.She spent three years based in North Belfast, between the republican New Lodge and loyalist Tigers Bay areas. Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue.

This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl claims its proposal will create an additional  jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.Permission has also been granted to a number of people to address todayrsquos Planning Committee meeting.Due to address councillors are planning consultant, Andy Stephens, who is objecting to the proposal, while Seamus McMullan Architects have requested to address politicians on behalf of Dr M Rooney who is also opposed to the Lidl proposal.Further speaking rights requests have been received from Conleth Rooney BL on behalf of Don Holdings Ltd, objecting to the application, with Lidlrsquos Norther Ireland Regional Director Conor Boyle and Nicholas McCrickard from the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team, also due to address committee members.The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos meeting, planners reaffirm that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.The store argues the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found. Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register.

Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

The industrial action involves all NHS staff, not just nurses.ldquoThere is mounting concern that NHS staff are being used as a political football to pressurise the politicians to get agreement on restoring the Assembly. It appears that we are being used as a pawn in a wider political game, but the health and care of patients should be above that.The RCN is planning more industrial action today and again this Friday, with Unison confirming that its members will not be working any overtime on Friday.ldquoOur members are the lowest paid of all in the UK, said Mr McConnell.ldquoEvery time our members take part in industrial action they are losing money. But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end. A stroke of a pen can end this dispute and will send a clear message to NHS workers that they are valued and, signicantly, equal to their colleagues across the NHS.ldquoThe pay parity and safe staffing level issues must be addressed now..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/10862912.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"oscar nominations full","story":"Best picture:Ford v Ferrari The IrishmanJojo RabbitJokerLittle WomenMarriage StoryOnce Upon A Timehellip In HollywoodBest actor:Antonio Banderas ndash Pain And GloryLeonardo DiCaprio ndash Once Upon A Timehellip In HollywoodAdam Driver ndash Marriage StoryJoaquin Phoenix ndash JokerBest supporting actor:Tom Hanks ndash A Beautul Day In The NeighbourhoodSir Anthony Hopkins ndash The Two PopesAl Pacino ndash The IrishmanJoe Pesci ndash The IrishmanBest actress:Cynthia Erivo ndash HarrietScarlett Johansson ndash Marriage StorySaoirse Ronan ndash Little WomenCharlize Theron ndash BombshellBest supporting actress:Kathy Bates ndash Richard JewellLaura Dern ndash Marriage StoryScarlett Johansson ndash Jojo RabbitFlorence Pugh ndash Little WomenAchievement in directing:The Irishman ndash Martin ScorseseJoker ndash Todd Phillips ndash Sam MendesOnce Upon A Timehellip In Hollywood ndash Quentin TarantinoAdapted screenplay:The Irishman ndash Steven ZaillianJojo Rabbit ndash Taika WaititiJoker ndash Todd Phillips and Scott SilverLittle Women ndash Greta GerwigOriginal screenplay:Knives Out ndash Rian JohnsonMarriage Story ndash Noah Baumbach ndash Sir Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-CairnsOnce Upon A Timehellip In Hollywood ndash Quentin TarantinoBest animated feature film:How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden WorldI Lost My BodyKlausMissing LinkAchievement in cinematography:The Irishman ndash Rodrigo PrietoJoker ndash Lawrence SherThe Lighthouse ndash Jarin Blaschke ndash Roger DeakinsAchievement in costume design:The Irishman ndash Sandy Powell and Christopher PetersonJojo Rabbit ndash Mayes C.

Decisions regarding investment, growth and key animal health issues such as the control of bovine TB, have not been taken and operational issues which the Brexit fall-out could create for our existing trading patterns with our present markets in GB, ROI and the EU, adds further complexity. “The local farming industry is already beginning to experience Brexit-related change in terms of the legal basis for direct payments to NI farmers this year and we will need input from Mr Poots as DAERA Minister to help us though this challenging process..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “Considerable uncertainty lies ahead for our industry, but the new Minister will have our full support.

market post Brexit and protect and enhance the future viability of our family farms and agri businesses,” Mr Ferguson added.Storm Brendan | Thousands of homes now without left without power

A section of DUP members believe that Mrs Foster’s leadership has been disastrous for unionism and a third of Sinn Fein ard fheis delegates recently voted to remove Ms O’Neill.Therefore, they are more constrained in their ability to make the sort of magnanimous gestures necessary to persuade the other side that they are genuine about reaching out and working together.Even their compromise has done little to convince each other’s supporters. Mrs Foster’s concessions on the Irish language have been made grudgingly while Sinn Fein’s Mary Lou McDonald said on Friday that she did not even accept some elements of the deal which involve more Britishness, claiming that they were some form of side deal between the DUP and the NIO.In their comments on Saturday, Stormont’s new leaders tried to reach out, aware that this new Executive will only surviveit exists on a wide base of public support. Both leaders, whose tone is often disastrous when heard from the other side of the ide, spoke with the sort of optimism which has become foreign to Northern Irish politics over the last three years.On their side they have many of the public wearied by three years without a government and willing them to make it work. But it will be dficult for this pair to so swtly move from years of rancour and convince even their own voters that this is a new dawn.With the DUP and Sinn Fein having been confronted with the implications of their past secrecy, rule-breaking and in some cases law-breaking, it is possible that they have genuinely repented and will operate to higher standards.In defence of that hypothesis, the new deal involves some reforms – such as a strengthened requirement for civil servants to take minutes of meetings – whichimplemented will curb the room for bad behaviour.Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Belfast to meet Arlene Foster and Michelle O’NeillDeal toStormont is a ‘beachhead’ to Irish unity, says Declan Kearney of Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But in the last Stormont many of the worst practices involved simply ignoring rules, while officials looked the other way. In part, that was because civil servants, in some cases for the noblest of reasons, wanted devolution to work and believed that bending the rules to help their political masters may help the process.Amid the relief at the restoration of Stormont, it is easy to see how civil servants and others could be tempted to sweep uncomfortable truths under the rugthey think they might destabilise the new regime.Yet it is now clear that such short-term willingness to accept indefensible behaviour allowed that behaviour to flourish to the extent that it toppled not inidual ministers or spads but the entire edice of Stormont.It is therefore striking that there will now be less internal scrutiny of the Stormont system than at the point when it fell over the cash for ash scandal. The decisions of the UUP, SDLP and Alliance to re-enter the Executive means that there are now only five of the  MLAs who are not members of governing parties.That restricts the potential for flaws to be spotted at an earlier stage. On Saturday that point was made by a minister in the last Executive, independent MLA Claire Sugden.Although as a former minister she had faced the discomfort of facing an opposition in the Assembly chamber, she said: “Opposition improves legislation. If policy cannot [face] the challenge which other members provide to it, then it’s not good policy and no one benefits from that.”In , the creation of the first official opposition at Stormont since  breathed le into the Assembly, forcing ministers to treat it with respect rather than as a rubber stamp, and sharpening scrutiny of the notoriously secretive Executive.Without that in place, and with the public now aware through the RHI scandal of the grisly innards of past Executives, there is a danger that the entire Stormont system will now be seen as unable to hold itself to account.While that might be more comfortable for the DUP and Sinn Fein in the short term, it would ultimately be strategically damaging for the whole idea of devolution.try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story IRISH SinnFein. Photo credit should read: Brian Lawless PA WireThe order’s comments came after an interview by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald where she was asked about the matter.“The Orange Institution is not interested in engaging in ‘conversations’ or responding to hypothetical statements which merely assist Sinn Fein and nationalists as they continue to ‘talk up’ the inevitability of a united Ireland,” an Orange spokesman said.“Orangemen in many communities across Ireland have experienced Republicanism’s intolerance and hatred first-hand. Ironically, despite these comments, recent developments in the Republic of Ireland have shown us the reality that Sinn Fein and others are not really interested in equality – or the historical commemoration of anything deemed to be British.”Ms McDonald had told the Irish Independent she was willing to put celebrating the Twelfth of July across the island of Ireland on the table in talks about a future Border poll.She said “everything should be on the table” when asked specically about annual celebration.“I’ll tell you how we do it, we do it by having them [unionists] front and centre in the conversation and asking them, because I would be absolutely astonishedfor people of a unionist persuasion the issue around the Twelfth of July was not raised,” she said.“We, more than any other political party in the Oireachtas, are used to working with, living with, dealing with our unionist neighbours and the Twelfth of July is very widely celebrated.”Ms McDonald’s comments were made before the current controversy over the now-postponed Irish state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin politan Police. Sinn Féin led calls for the event to be cancelled altogether amid concerns it amounts to celebrating the Black and Tans.While acknowledging Sinn Féin supporters may not favour marking the Twelfth, Ms McDonald believes people will “surprise themselves” with what they find acceptable in a united Ireland.“Generally speaking, people are decent and reasonable and they want a good le for themselves and for their families and they are happy to accommodate and respect their neighbours so long as that accommodation and respect comes back to them,” she said. “They’re kind of the go-to issues when people talk about Irish unity, and that’s fine. Bring all of that to the table. Let’s talk about it.”While critics claim she is not in control and Sinn Féin is still run out of west Belfast, the paper said, she insisted Gerry Adams “doesn’t pull my strings, nobody’s pulling my strings”.Ms McDonald also declined to express regret for proclaiming “up the rebels” and “tiocfaidh ár lá” when she took over as leader. “No,” she said when asked about using militant Republican language. “Up the rebels.”LBC journalist and NI man Matthew Thompson tweeted: “That’s nice and all. But you’d think allowing unionists one day of the year to celebrate their heritage would be the least they might expect from a united Ireland.”In  former Sinn Fein TD Peadar Toibin said he was not sure the time was right for southern Orangemen to parade in their capital, saying there is “a broken relationship” with the order which needs work to be fixed.TUV Councillor Matthew Armstrong said the Orange community would treat the offer “with the contempt its deserves”.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"shops get drop rates pubs see large spike ","story":"Portadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedA full ‘Wolf Moon’ will appear alongside the lunar eclipse in the UK tonight - here’s how to see itNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsShops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeSome retailers and banks in Portadown are to benefit from a drop in rates while a number of pubs face a signicant increase in their bills.By The NewsroomFriday, th January , : pm\"Portadown Town Centre.A new business rates valuation has been announced by Land and Property Services this week - the first shake up since .Chamber of Commerce President Adrian Farrell said the reduction in rates for some retailers was ‘a step in the right direction’.However he voiced concerns at the sharp rise in rates for some businesses in the hospitality sector.At least one licenced premises close to the town centre has seen their rateable value shoot up by almost % and will be expected to pay almost £k extra per annum.Another town centre bar will see a leap of % on their rates, and will be expected to pay more than £k extra each year. Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them. View the draft schedule of values at www.finance-ni.gov.uk reval--niIf ratepayers are unable to access the required information online they can contact LPS on Tel:   .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business urging cross party political backing to restore assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community is urging cross-party political backing for a deal which could see the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
