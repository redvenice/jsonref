Pictured: The sextuplets at four years old in 2008 One of Jon\u0027s biggest gripes is that four of his children are still having to work on TV to \u0027support their mother\u0027.He hits out at Kate for \u0027not working\u0027 herself.\u0027They shouldn\u0027t have to work for their existence,\u0027 he says.\u0027We should have to provide for our children, our children shouldn\u0027t have to provide for us.

I have a job.\u0027  They shouldn\u0027t have to work for their existence. We should have to provide for our children, our children shouldn\u0027t have to provide for us.  Jon insists Kate is still motivated by \u0027power, control, fame and money\u0027 and wants to remain relevant in the TV world.Her latest project is a dating show called Kate Plus Date which premiered in July on TLC.Together with her twin 18-year-old daughters, Mady and Cara, and a matchmaker, Kate reflects on what happened following different dates.While promoting the show Kate has done various media interviews and can\u0027t help but drop references to her ex-husband.But it\u0027s the \u0027lies\u0027 Jon claims his ex spouts that infuriates him most.\u0027In one interview with People magazine Kate said that she uses her money to provide for the children\u0027s education,\u0027 he explains.\u0027There\u0027s a quote and I\u0027m like, no - everything is theirs, she has done nothing.

Once, when were on the way there, he kept saying his leg hurt and I thought he was just making it up. Now we will never know if there was a more sinister reason.\u0027One incident in particular is still painfully etched on her mind.         George, who had been married for more than 20 years at the time she was arrested, took 124 obscene images of children on her mobile during a six-month period\u0027I\u0027d arrived to pick him up and he\u0027d wet himself. Vanessa George asked if I wanted her to change him into his spare clothes before I took him home. I said yes.\u0027She finds it torturous now to think of her son lying on the changing mat where George abused many of her tiny young victims, sexually assaulting them with toothbrushes, crayons and even a plastic golf club.It is this poisonous legacy of uncertainty, says the mother, that makes her and other parents certain George is not fit to be released from prison.George, who had been married for more than 20 years at the time she was arrested, took 124 obscene images of children on her mobile during a six-month period. She shared them with two other paedophiles she met on the internet — Colin Blanchard, who was the lynchpin of the group, and Angela Allen.The trio, who had never met in person until they appeared in the dock together, egged each other on to abuse children and were only caught when one of Blanchard\u0027s business colleagues came across the explicit images on his computer.In court, where George pleaded guilty to seven sexual assaults on young children and six counts of making and distributing indecent images of children, her barrister claimed Blanchard had encouraged her to commit the abuse.That claim was rejected by Mr Justice Royce, who said: \u0027She is not a child. This is a married woman who can make up her own mind whether she indulges in this sort of activity or not.\u0027 He appealed directly to George, who described herself online as a \u0027paedo whore mumma\u0027, to reveal the names of the children she harmed.\u0027I would like your help,\u0027 he said, adding that she \u0027must know\u0027 who was in the photos. Speaking to her lawyer, he added: \u0027If I were a parent, I would want to know if my child was abused or not. Would it not be decent for her to indicate who she has abused?\u0027Plymouth MP Luke Pollard told the Mail this week that George\u0027s release was \u0027a dark day\u0027 for the parents whose children were once placed in her care, and one that \u0027reopened all the wounds of ten years ago\u0027.\u0027She\u0027s not just any criminal,\u0027 he said. \u0027She is Britain\u0027s most prolific female sex offender and she is still wielding power over these families by not naming their victims.\u0027Having been quietly released under licence from Bronzefield women\u0027s prison in Ashford, Middlesex, on Wednesday, George is believed to be staying in a probation hostel, at a cost to taxpayers of about £30,000 a year.Such hostels, managed by National Probation Service staff, each have between 15 and 20 bedrooms. Bathrooms are shared and the women are provided with three meals a day. George will also attend weekly meetings with a dedicated probation officer, at which she will be expected to talk about how she has spent her time and discuss her feelings, as well as the risks she faces on the outside.She is subject to strict conditions including a night-time curfew and a ban on using social media or owning any device with access to the internet. She is not allowed to return to Devon and Cornwall or to travel to a third county where one of her victims is believed to have moved, as well as 20 other exclusion zones connected to those affected by her crimes.She will never again be allowed to work with children or have unsupervised contact with them, and will be on the sex offenders\u0027 register for the rest of her life.Despite all these conditions, Luke Pollard said there were real concerns among families about how George\u0027s parole conditions will be enforced.\u0027The idea that in today\u0027s society they can keep her away from the internet for ever is ludicrous,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ve got to be certain that adequate resources are being made available to ensure there are no lapses.\u0027These parents have been through hell and now they have a whole new set of worries.\u0027The criminal justice system is not listening to victims. I want to see the rules around parole changed, particularly for those who refuse to name their victims.\u0027Such was the strength of feeling about George\u0027s impending release from prison that Mr Pollard had a meeting with Devon and Cornwall police, who subsequently re-examined their files to see whether further charges could be put to George so she could be kept behind bars.But officers were only able to find \u0027corresponding charges\u0027 — lesser charges relating to crimes of which she had already been found guilty. As these would not increase her sentence, no further action was taken.The contradictory message sent out at the time of her sentencing — when parents were told she could be out in seven years but would probably be in prison for life — goes back to a policy brought in by the last Labour government.Sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPPs) were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett. The Home Office originally estimated they would imprison only 900 \u0027dangerous\u0027 criminals under such sentences.Those convicted would be given a fixed tariff like any other prisoner but could be kept in prison for as long as the Parole Board deemed them a threat to society.The maximum sentence George could receive for her crimes was seven years — but by giving her an indeterminate sentence, Mr Justice Joyce may well have believed she would be kept inside for much longer than that.Sentences of IPP were scrapped in 2012, amid claims they were violating human rights and causing prison overcrowding. As the numbers of IPP prisoners grew, more and more convicts demanded access to the rehabilitation and resettlement programmes they had to undertake to show they were no longer a risk to society.There were claims, too, that such sentences were affecting prisoners\u0027 mental health, with a report by the Prison Reform Trust stating that IPP prisoners suffered the highest rates of self-harm in prison.Last year, Sam Gyimah, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Probation, said the Government was focused on increasing the number of IPP prisoners released by processing their cases \u0027as quickly as possible\u0027.In March this year, 2,400 such prisoners remained. Of those, 43 —including George — were women.The decision to release her was taken after a Parole Board hearing in July this year which determined that she was safe to be freed from jail, after she convinced them that she had undergone treatment for her low self-esteem.The board noted how \u0027all the professional witnesses recommended that Ms George be released\u0027.But is it possible that George — who now goes by her maiden name, Vanessa Marks — is no longer a threat to the public? The families of the children she once cared for don\u0027t think so.Victims\u0027 rights campaigner Harry Fletcher says George\u0027s apparent lack of remorse means her release is \u0027worrying\u0027.\u0027Scores of parents in the areas where she worked don\u0027t know whether their child was a victim,\u0027 he says. \u0027The prison system should have taken that into account. Given the enormity of what she did, her sentence was grossly inadequate.\u0027Mr Fletcher said he understood ministers were urgently looking at George\u0027s case with a view to changing guidelines on sentence length.Given the level of hatred directed at her, it is hard to imagine how George will be able to revert to anything resembling a normal life.She is unable to return to the South West of England, the only place she ever lived before going to jail, and was orced by her husband Andrew shortly after being sent to prison. She is estranged from their two daughters, who are now adults, and her parents are dead.For those affected by her crimes, George\u0027s wellbeing is of no concern. \u0027I hope her life is torture because that\u0027s what she\u0027s done to us,\u0027 says the father who spoke to the Mail this week.Families with connections to Little Ted\u0027s Nursery have spent the past decade trying to put the horror of her crimes behind them. That the monster who preyed on their children is back out on the streets again is, for them, the greatest injustice of all.Additional reporting: Izzy Ferris"},{"url":null,"title":"Family quiet hero refuses charge elderly says nice good","story":"Share this article Mother to Annalise, 13 and Thomas, 11, from her first marriage, Barbara was left with severe disabilities, after breaking her back when she was mowed down by a car aged 18. Together they formed a contented and close \u0027patchwork family\u0027, but their happiness was almost destroyed when the couple\u0027s son William died in 2013 at 16 weeks old following a bowel operation. Born prematurely, weighing just 1lb 13oz and with a heart defect, his loss devastated the Andersons. Pictures of their boy decorate their home, and they have created a memorial in their front garden.However, far from retreating from the world, consumed with grief, this tragedy — and Barbara\u0027s own experience of disability — inspired them to help others instead.Mr Anderson was earning about £30,000 a year when two years ago he decided to launch a non-profit Community Initiative Company called Depher — Disabled and Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Response.As far as he is aware, it is the only plumbing business of its kind in the world, reliant on donations and grants to offer free or discounted services to needy customers.The idea was sparked after Mr Anderson saw an elderly disabled man poorly treated by another engineer, who\u0027d landed him with a hefty repair bill and a £5,500 quote for a new boiler which wasn\u0027t necessary.\u0027The next day I couldn\u0027t get this gentleman out of my head,\u0027 he says. \u0027I was furious with the way he\u0027d been treated. I thought: \u0027If this has happened to him, it\u0027s probably happening all over the UK.\u0027 That\u0027s when I decided I had to do something.\u0027Mr Anderson spoke to his accountant, who registered his new non-profit company, and he used the money from his regular plumbing jobs to finance the free ones.But with elderly vulnerable customers making up 90 per cent of his workload in the winter, compared with 25 per cent in the summer, there was a shortfall in funding so he raised £77,000 through crowd-funding and received other donations, including a £2,000 grant from the Duchy of Lancaster.\u0027Since then, we have done 2,389 jobs for elderly and disabled — mostly it\u0027s free, but if we don\u0027t have the funds then it\u0027s discounted by 25 or 50 per cent,\u0027 he says proudly.\u0027When I started out as a plumber, I just went for the best paid jobs, but now I take home £100 a week, which I give straight to Barbara. Everything else goes into the company or paying off the £8,000 debt.\u0027Though they live in a mortgage-free home paid for by Barbara\u0027s compensation from her accident and mostly exist on her disability benefits, it\u0027s been a tough two years, financially and emotionally.Daughter Paige, 24, says: \u0027I am really proud of my Dad, but it\u0027s also been hard to sit and watch my parents struggle through all the sacrifices they\u0027ve had to make.\u0027Barbara adds: \u0027James was very down when he started to receive death threats and told me \u0027Perhaps I should give it up\u0027. But it\u0027s something he has to do and I never tried to stop him, even though it was frightening.\u0027Of his decision to carry on, despite the threats, James says: \u0027There were always going to be some people who thought I was too good to be true or out to take away their livelihoods. But it\u0027s not about me.\u0027Since James was dubbed \u0027Britain\u0027s kindest plumber\u0027 he has been overwhelmed by the response. One company has offered him free business insurance, worth £2,000 a year, Reliance Bank has offered free lifetime banking for his business and others have offered free holidays.He says hundreds of tradespeople have been in touch offering their services for free, too, and a London firm wants to discuss joining forces to expand his idea nationwide.Abroad too, James\u0027 selflessness is inspiring others, with people in the U.S., France and Australia wanting to exchange ideas and set up similar companies. His vision is for free plumbing for every single vulnerable, elderly or disabled person in the UK.He says: \u0027I spoke to a woman from North Wales just yesterday who had an engineer quote her £2,500 to take out a toilet, put in three pieces of floorboard and then put the same toilet back. I was disgusted, so I told her: \u0027Give me 14 days and ring me back and if I\u0027ve got enough funds, I will do it.\u0027On call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Barbara laughs when she says the downside of being married to the nation\u0027s most caring tradesman is that he\u0027s too busy to fix their own dripping taps.\u0027It takes him a long time to do anything at home,\u0027 she says, adding: \u0027And when he does, he cuts corners so he can get back to the customers who need him.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Nancy Pelosi demands new law make possible INDICT sitting president","story":"Share this article          President Donald Trump was insulated by DOJ guidelines that state a sitting president can\u0027t be prosecuted.

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

Further up the river, Westminster is shutting down for five weeks. Ever since Boris Johnson raised the prospect of proroguing parliament, people have been sharing a quote from The Handmaid’s Tale, published 35 years ago, just as they did in the US following the election of Donald Trump in 2016: “That was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn’t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed at home at night, watching television.”“It is another predictable mess that people have got drawn into because a big honking pack of lies was told about it,” Atwood says of Brexit. Apart from the legal questions – “actions have consequences, but what will the consequences be?” – she is most interested in “who is going to benefit from this financially? Who is shorting the pound? I can think of all kinds of people who might turn it to their advantage.”As has been noted, the last time a novel received such a fanfare was the midnight launches for Harry Potter books – with fans sporting specs and scarves instead of capes and bonnets. Atwood is our high sorceress, a very grownup one, with a truly unnerving knack for auspicious timing. Her best work combines psychological acuity with audacious curiosity she is as good at recreating the politics of the playground (Cat’s Eye, 1989) as she is at inventing a chillingly plausible male theocracy. She is both deadly serious and surprisingly playful, and it is to her that readers have turned as a way of making sense of the world, helped by the hugely successful TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. With cameo appearances as an Aunt, and another in the TV version of her 1996 novel Alias Grace, which also aired in 2017, she describes the last couple of years as “horrible fun: when the occasion for the fun is not so happy. And the occasion for the fun is the rise of religious fundamentalist actions against women”.Like Kafka and Orwell, Atwood has become part of the public discourse the red and white robes adopted as a symbol of female defiance from Ireland to Argentina, but most often in the US, where her near-future dystopia, in which women have been reduced to female reproductive slaves, was set. Yet back in 1985, when The Handmaid’s Tale, Atwood’s sixth novel, was published, “a big fuss was not particularly made. I think we had some sort of publisher’s party,” she says dryly.The sequel has been surrounded by levels of secrecy to rival any ex-prime minister’s memoir, with tales of Booker judges’ computers being hacked (The Testaments is on this year’s shortlist). “I left my computer on a plane,” she confides. “I forgot about it because I was watching Captain Underpants.” She didn’t have a copy of The Testaments on it, but there was enough information to cause a stir if it fell into the wrong hands. Atwood doesn’t – yet – have the powers to ground a plane, but she was reunited with her computer within two hours. “It would have been a catastrophe,” she says, laughing now.Then Amazon blew it all by sending out copies in the US a week ahead of publication. “Somebody pushed the wrong button. It was human error,” she says unruffled. “They apologised, which is apparently among the first times, if not the first time, that Amazon have ever apologised.”Despite her formidable energy, Atwood embodies an owl-like stillness – head tilted, listening carefully, with only her hands moving when she speaks. She gives long, far-ranging answers (not always to the question asked), and can leap from Mary Queen of Scots to Mary Poppins, or from the Cromwells to the day’s news, in the blink of a gimlet eye. At nearly 80, what does she make of this remarkable late boost? “Isn’t it wild,” she says. “I can’t remember a time when I was a usual anything,” she says. “I mean going way back. I didn’t grow up in a usual way” (her childhood was spent in the Canadian wilderness). “I wasn’t a usual kind of high-school student. I was a very peculiar university student and it continued on from there.” Atwood “became” a writer at 16, when she made up a poem in her head while crossing a football field. Since then she has written more than 60 books, in almost every genre, and has been awarded more than 100 prizes, including the Booker in 2000 for The Blind Assassin. Her futuristic trilogy – Oryx and Crake (2003), The Year of the Flood (2009) and MaddAddam (2013) – has an ardent following. She lives in Toronto, spending her summers on Pelee Island, where she has written many of her novels, including much of The Testaments (as well as a stint, more surprisingly, in Norwich).The author has just had a long chat with Bruce Miller, the TV series’ showrunner, who is “quite thrilled” about the new novel, “because it gives him a lot more to work with”. Atwood, an executive producer on the show, had started writing The Testaments before the first season launched. And there shouldn’t be any clashes, as her sequel picks up 15 years later: “We know where we start in the 15 years, but there’s quite a lot of squeezing room for things that happen leading up to that,” the author explains. “I’ve given him a lot of blank space that will be his to fill. We agreed he can’t kill off certain people a long time ago.”“Hands off Aunt Lydia” and “don’t touch that baby” were her principal stipulations. “I needed this child here and that child there – so that’s how it’s going to be.” The Testaments is narrated by three voices: it is the last will and testament of Aunt Lydia, and the testimonies of two girls, Agnes who has grown up in Gilead, and Daisy who escaped to Canada with her mother as a baby. Atwood’s reluctance to write as Offred, the narrator of The Handmaid’s Tale, was one of the reasons it took her so long to attempt a sequel, despite “the clamouring” from readers. “I couldn’t do it,” she says emphatically. “Not possible. To recreate that voice and do more of it. I just couldn’t.” She is wary of follow-ups in general. “They are always kind of imitations. I saw Mary Poppins Returns. A commendable sequel. I enjoyed it, but it’s not the same.”Atwood has said in the past that The Handmaid’s Tale was written to answer the question: if there was a totalitarian regime in the US what form would it take? The Testaments sets out to show how such a regime collapses: “What makes them turn into something else? What makes them fall apart?” And for that she needed an insider: “So who in that whole cast of characters is going to know more? There’s only one answer to that.” Aunt Lydia, a female Thomas Cromwell, “swollen with power” but without absolute authority.Many readers have wondered what they might do in Offred’s situation, how to resist and survive by giving us Aunt Lydia’s story, Atwood asks us to think about questions of cruelty and complicity. All her novels are about survival. As Aunt Lydia reflects: “What good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principles and then be crushed flat like a sock emptied of its foot? ... Better to hurl rocks than to have them hurled at you.” Or as Atwood puts it: “We are ordinary as long as it is easy to be ordinary.” She quotes a Polish resistance fighter from the second world war who once told her: ‘“Pray that you will never have the occasion to be a hero.’ You don’t run into a burning building and rescue somebody unless there’s a burning building … Similarly, you don’t run away from a burning building and ignore everything, unless there’s a burning building.”But the main reason for not returning sooner to the world she had created was because, before now, it no longer seemed relevant. “For a long time we were going away from Gilead and then we turned around and started going back towards Gilead, so it did seem pertinent.” The Handmaid’s Tale, which Atwood began writing in West Berlin in 1984, was her response to those who wanted to reverse the freedoms gained by women in the 70s, to put the butterflies back in the box. “They just didn’t have the power to make that happen.” Now they do.The novel’s status as a feminist classic has perhaps overshadowed another of its most prescient warnings – the catalyst for Gilead was environmental catastrophe. In The Testaments Aunt Lydia catalogues the natural disasters that ravaged “her vanished country”, before continuing. “People became frightened. Then they became angry. The absence of viable remedies. The search for someone to blame. You don’t believe the sky is falling in until a chunk of it falls on you.”If the novel deals less explicitly with the crisis than we might have expected, her point is the same: the burden will fall hardest on women and children. “It always does, because women and children are weaker – let’s take their stuff,” she says. But, as Atwood points out, she “did climate apocalypse quite thoroughly” in the MaddAddam trilogy. “Maybe not thoroughly enough,” she says, “because I think it is actually going to be worse.” But she is not without hope, and if she was younger she would “absolutely be doing Extinction Rebellion”. She was the first writer to donate a manuscript to the Future Library, in which stories remain unread for 100 years, when they will be printed on paper from a newly planted forest in Norway.At an event last summer, a member of the audience asked Atwood for one word to sum up the times we are living in. “Vital,” she fired back. “This is a hinge moment, in many different ways,” she says now. “Let’s call it the casket moment,” an allusion to the three caskets in The Merchant of Venice. “One of those puzzles in which you need to open the right door. So, ‘All right human race, which door are you going to open?’”One of Atwood’s central axioms is that nothing can be included in her fiction that hadn’t happened somewhere in the world. As Atwood has reminded us: she didn’t make this stuff up, the human race did. “If I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real,” she wrote in a recent introduction to The Handmaid’s Tale. And this is “absolutely” the case for The Testaments: shadows of Weinstein and Epstein, Isis and the Trump administration can all be found in its murky waters. It is impossible to read the scenes set in a female detention camp without thinking of the US-Mexico border.Is Atwood firing a warning or reflecting what is already happening? “Both. But warnings aren’t effective if they are just preaching. Enactments are of interest because then people think ‘What would I do?’ Whereas if someone is going ‘Don’t do that, don’t do that,’” she says, wagging her finger. “You think ‘Oh shut up!’”This is the sixth time Atwood has been shortlisted for the Booker prize. “There are upsides and downsides” to winning, she says. If you win everyone says you shouldn’t have won the Booker. And if you don’t win, in Canada anyway, they say ‘Atwood fails to win Booker’.” And then there is the Nobel. “Oh purlease …” She is already at work on a collection of poetry, often her way of working up to a novel. And she hasn’t ruled out a further instalment: “Never say never to anything.”“Only dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive”: so Aunt Lydia opens The Testaments. Is there an Atwood statue? “There’s a head,” she laughs. “We used to call it the horrible head.” The plaster cast is in her cellar, the original, made in the 70s, at McMaster University. “I don’t look like that,” she told the sculptor, who replied. “But you will …”“People bang on about your legacy,” she says, impatiently. “I’m not that interested because I’m not going to be here. I’m not going to be around haunting my legacy. Unless I do an Aunt Lydia and bury little manuscripts in libraries.” Well, there’s already that story buried away in the Future Library. Praise be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b15032273a91f39e3eee4ce8887d63df7b456c9f/0_454_4496_2697/master/4496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b11060158737394d26b1a722b335032","title":"the confession by jessie burton review","story":"Jessie Burton’s previous novel featured an artist and her muse this follow-up concerns a writer and her amanuensis. Constance Holden is a reclusive novelist with a formidable reputation who has published nothing for more than 30 years. Now in her 70s and crippled with osteoarthritis, she employs a young woman called Laura Brown as a housekeeper and secretary. Laura assures her that she’s the patient type. “Then I’ll call you the patient typist,” Constance replies.Readers of Burton’s fiction may notice the continuation of a theme, as The Muse similarly began with a young woman being employed as a typist by an inscrutable female art historian. It’s perhaps also worth noting that Burton herself worked as a PA in the City before the publication in 2014 of her million-selling debut, The Miniaturist, so has first-hand experience of supporting herself in a menial role while quietly composing a piece of art.The Confession also follows The Muse in establishing a dual time-frame. Episodes set in the present day illustrate Constance’s increasing dependency on Laura as she struggles to break her silence with a new book. These passages are interleaved with scenes from the early 1980s when Constance was at the height of her fame, the author of two influential novels and a much-cited essay on female empowerment. Throughout this halcyon period of large advances and Hollywood film offers, Constance’s closest companion was her lover Elise Morceau a young, waif-like woman she met while walking on Hampstead Heath in north London.Elise is the novel’s most enigmatic character: a neurotic drifter who both feeds off and resents Constance’s growing celebrity. She becomes increasingly depressed and detached when Constance moves to the US to pursue her ambitions of becoming a player in the movie industry. Then Elise simply disappears, absconding from a filthy Brooklyn apartment leaving a newborn baby behind. The only certain fact is that, immediately prior to her disappearance, Elise received a final visit from Constance.While The Muse was a novel about the creative drive of painters, The Confession is a meditation on fiction and the compulsion to invent alternative realities. Not only does Constance spend much time theorising on the mechanics of her craft, her helpmeet “Laura Brown” is also an act of pure self-invention. From the outset the reader is made aware that “Laura” is really Rose Simmons, the baby abandoned by Elise, who has worked her way into Constance’s confidence in the hope of extracting information from the last person to have seen her mother alive.RoseLaura seems to have inherited most of her mother’s insecurities she works shifts in a coffee shop and is tethered to a hopeless partner whose burrito van business has stalled. Helping Constance not only brings her closer to her mother, it enables the elaborate fabrication of a more fascinating, less flawed version of herselfThough The Confession does not extend as far into the past as her previous books, Burton deploys her characteristically piquant sense of period detail. The Miniaturist was dominated by the image of sugar fermenting in a damp warehouse, creating a cloying sense of 17th-century Amsterdam’s fortunes on the turn. Burton is equally adept at evoking London and Los Angeles on the crest of yuppie decadence: “Women with heavy eyeliner wearing velvet dresses with warrior shoulders, rubbing against tired City boys and men whose long hair flowed from fashionable hats. Denim, leather, nicotine, money – Elise could almost taste them on her tongue like elementals.”What one notices here, however, is a more free-flowing aspect to her prose, which is plainer and less obstructed by overworked passages than her earlier work. Perhaps this new sense of liberation has been prompted by having produced her first book for children, The Restless Girls a retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairytale “The Twelve Dancing Princesses” with a racy new slant. Like RoseLaura, the princesses are mourning the loss of a mother, who has been killed in a bizarre racing car accident. Kept under lock and key by an overprotective father, they are ultimately redeemed by the restorative power of storytellingThe Confession perhaps lacks the dramatic thrust of The Muse and The Miniaturist it is quite a slow build to the revelation promised by the title. But Burton is a writer fully in control of her craft as she employs the fundamental co-ordinates of a fairytale. Overall it stands as another understated triumph for the patient typist.• The Confession is published by Picador (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Dutch media has called it “organised crime in pinstripe suits” and one of the original German whistleblowers saying he now welcomes Britain’s exit from the EU in the hope it could weaken the influence of London investment banking on European financial institutions.This week, a British former investment banker involved in developing the scheme for the first time gave the public an insight into how the scheme worked and what spurred on its architects.Speaking at a regional court in Bonn, Martin Shields, one of two former bankers on trial for 34 instances of serious tax fraud between 2006 and 2011, painted a picture of a London banking scene which lured in the brightest scientists from the country’s top universities and used them to boost their profit margins – without teaching them about the moral and legal consequences of their actions in return.A cum-ex deal, from the Latin meaning with-without, is a complex set of share transactions with the purpose of getting the state to reimburse a tax that was never paid in the first place.Cum-ex transactions work by trading shares at high speed on or just before the idend record date – the day the company checks its records to identify shareholders – and then claiming two or more refunds for capital gains tax which had in fact only been paid to the state once. Because the payout is automated, the trade can be repeated again and again.Some financial experts have likened the practice to the banking equivalent of parents claiming child benefit for multiple children when they only have one.“This was the environment at that time: a financial industry that – at least as far as I could see – was geared towards maximum profit optimisation,” the 41-year-old told a packed courtroom on Wednesday.“One tool to achieve this goal was tax optimisation: avoiding taxation as far as possible – and taking advantage of any opportunities that could be found or created. This was not the clandestine approach of a few. Rather, I saw it as the clear and openly communicated expectation of most major banks and their customers.”Hailed as a maths prodigy at school, Shields accepted a junior position at Merrill Lynch after studying engineering, economics and management at Oxford University because the trading room floor offered him a thrilling, dynamic environment. He was not alone: of 120 engineers in his year group at university, Shields added, only five went into engineering.Wearing a navy blue suit and the latest Apple Watch 5 with a white strap, Shields on Wednesday used a Powerpoint presentation to talk the court through the “cum-ex ecosystem” of labyrinthine trade chains he helped conceive and control, which prosecutors say cost the German state €450m. A translator tasked with rendering City trader jargon into German legalese was struggling to keep up.The financial rewards were breathtaking: for the five years in which Shields practised cum-ex trades through Gibraltar-based investment vehicle Ballance Capital, his personal income amounted to €12m. In 2010 Shields and his wife managed to purchase a £9.7m mansion on Chelsea’s Egerton Crescent, followed by a €6m Edwardian terrace on Shrewsbury Road, Dublin’s most expensive residential street.While Shields did not respond directly to the charges of serious tax fraud this week, he said in hindsight he had started to feel regret about devising the schemes, which hoovered up money that could have otherwise been spent on building roads, hospitals or nurseries.He told the court: “I often ask myself whether if I had my time again I would do things differently. Knowing what I now know, the answer is obvious. I would not have involved myself in the cum-ex industry.”He had made the “difficult decision” to cooperate with the investigation, which increases his chance of reducing a potential 10-year jail service. Co-accused Nick Diable (39), who worked with Shields for Germany’s fourth largest bank HypoVereinsbank (HVB), will also give a testimony in the trial, which is expected to last until next year.Shields said cum-ex trades were practised on an “industrial scale” in the first decade of the 21st century, and involved a vast network of banks, companies, brokers, lawyers and financial advisers. Even the most basic cum-ex deal involves at least 12 transactions.A spokesman for Deutsche Börse, which was raided in connection with the wider investigation in August, said it was cooperating with the authorities.During Shields’s appearance this week, the back benches of the court were packed with numerous lawyers representing high-profile banks and financial institutions that could be dragged into the scandal if the judge in Bonn rules that cum-ex trades did not merely exploit a legal loophole but violated the law at the time.Three characters mentioned in the testimony were notable by their absence from the court proceedings: Shields’s long-time boss and later business partner Paul Mora, and the renowned German tax lawyer Hanno Berger, who allegedly introduced him to cum-ex methods at HVB. A third man, Dubai-based British citizen Sanjay Shah, is alleged to have copied their methods to defraud the Danish treasury on a vast scale.Until 2015, Mora was a director of the Cinnamon Club, an opulent ​Indian restaurant located in a grade II-listed Victorian building next to the Department for Education and popular with politicians and business people. According to Die Zeit, the restaurant was where cum-ex deals were contrived and later celebrated, and one insider referred to it as the “cum-ex lounge”. Mora has denied wrongdoing, telling New Zealand media that all his trades were “approved by legal experts and undertaken in accordance with advice”.In separate investigations into the same scheme, the justice minister of North-Rhine Westphalia said that Cologne prosecutors are now conducting 56 probes with a total of about 400 suspects related to cum-ex. More than 400 iniduals and companies have been charged in connection with the scheme in Denmark.Estimated losses include an estimated €31.8 bn Germany, at least €17bn for France, €4.5bn in Italy, €1.7bn in Denmark and €201m for Belgium“The Cologne investigations have now reached a point that prosecutors say that cum-ex wasn’t a legal tax-driven trading strategy, but organised white-collar crime of unimaginable magnitude,” the minister said.A prominent German tax official turned tax lawyer whose past clients include the owners of BMW and companies like Adidas, Berger has been described as the mastermind behind the cum-ex scheme and was charged with tax fraud at a court in Wiesbaden last year. Based in Switzerland, he insists all of his dealings were within the law and has not appeared in court so far.A 51-year-old Kiwi with a penchant for rugby and Hawaiian shirts, Mora had a background in tax law before moving into investment banking in the City of London. At HypoVereinsbank and his own investment vehicles Ballance Capital and Arunvill, Mora is alleged to have worked with Berger to construct a vast number of cum-ex trades. Believed to have returned to New Zealand, where he has property investments in Christchurch, Mora has also not appeared in the German courts to far.A British-born son of Indian immigrants from Kenya is the key figure for investigations in Denmark, where prosecutors say he defrauded the treasury to the tune of €1.3bn, mainly through his hedge fund Solo Capital LLP, by copying the system used by Berger. Shah has denied any wrongdoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e264a18547854f49ba3e86fa91b4cc7fe7c691b8/0_13_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdc15cde68253af4002246e4312bbfa4","title":"bankers corbyn tories no deal capitalism radical government","story":"Faced with the Tories’ no-deal extremism and a glaring crisis in capitalism, the financial establishment is losing its fear of a radical Labour governmentBeneath all the noise of Brexit, an unexpected question is being quietly asked in British politics as an election nears. Is a Jeremy Corbyn government actually the safe option? If you’ve been persuaded by the years of warnings from most of the media and countless politicians that such a government would be extreme, chaotic, authoritarian and doomed to failure, you may find this question ridiculous. If you’re still a Corbynista, then the notion of him as a stabilising premier for today’s turbulent Britain may be equally absurd. For many believers, the whole point of Corbynism has been the possibility that it might lead to “the most radical government in British history”, as the leftwing theorist and activist Jeremy Gilbert yearningly put it in 2017.Off the record, other senior people in the City tell me they find the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has been circulating among them busily in recent months, a serious and intriguing figure: a supposed Marxist who looks, and sometimes talks, a bit like a bank manager.A similar thaw is under way in the more thoughtful parts of the business press. With western capitalism having a crisis of confidence, at the very least – this week the Financial Times announced “Capitalism: time for a reset” – Labour’s radical economic alternatives have begun to look more reasonable to some business journalists. The Economist, despite its longstanding support for the Thatcherite free-market reforms that McDonnell would like to reverse, has been covering the development of Labour’s new economic thinking with intense curiosity since 2017. This month, the more cautious, centrist FT has published a succession of long articles about “Labour’s new establishment” and its ambitions for Britain. While the pieces were still spiked with criticisms, the scale of the coverage has suggested a degree of respect – and that corporate Britain needs to understand Corbynism, and be prepared to make some accommodations with it. Why are sections of the establishment being drawn to Corbyn and McDonnell now, having ignored or dismissed them for so long? On the face of it, the shift is all about stopping or moderating Brexit, at any cost. A little less obviously, it’s about the condition of the Conservative government: its snowballing incompetence, its increasingly manic and fantastical policies, its disregard for democracy and the law, its readiness to break up the UK, and its shallow pool of talent after almost a decade in power. (Priti Patel doesn’t seem likely to become one of the great home secretaries.) As Westminster participants and observers used to say, in more consensual times, it’s time for a swing of the pendulum.Since Corbyn became Labour leader, he and McDonnell have worked hard to seem more respectable. During Corbyn’s decades on the backbenches he was a bit of a scruffy ranter but in the Commons these days, with his neat white beard and stern glasses, he often acts more like a veteran school inspector, casting a disapproving eye over the government’s shoddy work. Both he and McDonnell now wear trim suits and ties to most public occasions the contrast with Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings’ careless dishevelment might make a good election poster.This air of solidity is not a complete illusion. Since Corbyn took over Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats have each had three leaders. Meanwhile Labour’s policies – relentlessly dismissed as weird and naive by newspapers that saw no downsides to austerity and Brexit – have in fact often carefully gone with the grain of public opinion: renationalise the railways, raise taxes on the rich, put more police on the streets, avoid fighting foreign wars that lead to terrorism.Potent governments, such as Tony Blair’s or Margaret Thatcher’s, usually have a good understanding of how most voters are thinking and living. Under Corbyn, Labour is at least trying to do the same, by beginning to confront the crises of capitalism and the climate breakdown, and how they affect people’s everyday lives.In less than half a decade, despite never being in power, and only rarely leading in the polls, Corbyn’s Labour has helped crystallise what students of the great Italian leftwing thinker Antonio Gramsci would call a new political common sense: a widespread feeling that free-market capitalism has run its course, public spending needs to rise, and the way we manage society and the economy needs to change. As a keen Gramscian, McDonnell must be delighted.But Labour’s new respectability brings dangers. First, do British voters actually want a sober, reforming government? The polls currently suggest not: since Johnson began his cartoonish premiership, Labour has been consistently behind (though the margins have varied from substantial to tiny, usually according to the pollsters’ different methods).Britain has arguably not had a Labour government with ambitions to profoundly alter the country since Harold Wilson’s first in the 1960s (and his reforming zeal didn’t last long). With Labour so often cautious since, many voters – and political journalists – have become unused to making the effort needed to consider novel and ambitious leftwing policies, such as McDonnell’s plan to change the balance of power in companies permanently by making their workforces into major shareholders. It’s easier just to dismiss such proposals as anti-business, and then get back to gossiping about the latest Tory leadership shambles.Another problem for Labour with trying to play the grownups is that clearing up messes left by Conservative governments can be a thankless task. In 1974, Wilson’s second administration inherited an economic and industrial relations crisis from the disastrous 1970-74 premiership of Edward Heath. Wilson never quite managed to resolve the crisis, and soon his party was blamed for it – so much so that Britain’s struggles during the 1970s have been synonymous with Labour ever since.Corbyn and McDonnell’s smart suits and new ideas will only get them a fair hearing from the establishment for so long. A Corbyn government, if it ever comes, will disrupt the status quo: “Change is coming,” McDonnell warned the FT this month. For the moment, some business figures may prefer a Corbyn government to a Tory one that can’t guarantee the food supply but they may soon decide that an actual reforming Labour government is not such a good idea after all. As Oliver Harvey of Deutsche Bank reassured the , “any market-unfriendly policies instigated during a Labour government” need only be “temporary”. They would apply only “until the government is voted out of office”. And just in case that doesn’t happen quickly enough, the papers read by Britain’s rich are full of articles about how to get your money out of the country. • Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8071e51da61c9a0ac157fcc94126d0cdf2c846a/0_0_2064_1238/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b4a9e85769a1883ef75171eca13579f","title":"downton abbey film fantasy reality","story":"The American south may seem a long way from the estates of England, but in both places a veil of caprice covers harsh truthsThe son of a Scottish immigrant who worked as a servant, Donald Trump could hardly wait for his banquet at Buckingham Palace. A seat next to Elizabeth II conferred a sense of accomplishment little else could.To many, such behavior from an American president appeared downright unseemly. But how could we scoff? How else have so many of us been eagerly awaiting the return of Downton Abbey?TV and film can be transporting, giving us glimpses of lives we can only imagine imperfectly. Decades before Julian Fellowes’ creation came forth to conquer America, PBS offered a steady diet of British clotted cream. Royals, aristocrats, castles, servants, sex. Such is the stuff of which Downton daydreams are made.We make our own fantasies too. As a boy, watching Gone With the Wind, I saw plantation houses for which I thought I could sell my soul. It seemed such an alluring way of life.No wonder people complain of being lectured about slavery when they visit Savannah or Charleston. They, like me, have imagined themselves in the master’s place. No work to be done, fanned on white-pillared porches, sipping cooling drinks, pondering pleasures to come. Is it surprising so many, confronted by the nightmare behind the reverie, recoil in unacknowledged shame?I came to this crossroads early, no longer able to overlook the anguish of my ancestors. I saw exquisite architecture and ideas of gracious hospitality but knew both to be built on the worst criminality.Fortunately, thanks to green England, I was able to transfer my affections. The Forsyte Saga, Upstairs Downstairs, Brideshead Revisited, The Admirable Crichton. The Shooting Party, The Remains of the Day, Gosford Park. They became my refuge and taught me much. Entranced by an elegant aesthetic, reading countless books, even attending the Attingham Summer School to study famous country houses, I sought an elusive loveliness, untroubled by oppression.I know I never escaped. I had only embraced a new quagmire of contradictory caprice.At the very lightest level, all this means I know that Downton – the whole phenomenon, the TV series, the film, the traveling exhibition, the merchandising – is a ludicrous and ahistorical fancy.I know, for example, that contrary to what we see on Fellowes’ screen, non-royal butlers did not wear white waistcoats and that waiters did not wear dinner jackets at all. I know ladies were never gloved while drinking or eating, candles were never used on a luncheon table and candle shades, now found only in royal residences, were in fact universal. For enthusiasts like me, it’s such esoterica which makes Downton so enjoyable.But as in my love affair with the plantations of the American south, there was a wriggling worm in the bud.How alike our ruling classes are. How nefarious the sources of their vast wealth, on which such beautiful homes were built.In the UK, to take just one example, a house as sublime as Harewood, near Leeds, altered by Robert Adam, was funded by the infamous triangular trade. Even English currency came to be defined by slavery. With abolition by Britain in 1833 came compensation to 46,000 slave owners for 800,000 liberated Africans, until the banks were rescued in 2009 the largest government bailout in history.There were other sources of income. Indian opium, imposed on China. Farms in Ireland. The wealth behind many of the estates of England was no less tainted than that which built plantations in Virginia, Alabama and Georgia.Fellowes was careful to give his great house a more benign foundation. The Earl of Grantham, we are told, derives his affluence straight from his Yorkshire estates.Hit hard by agricultural depressions, he takes an option not available to his tenants: he marries the daughter of an American millionaire. That said millionaire is an untitled Jew, a dry goods merchant from Cincinnati, is among storylines meant to show us what a good egg the earl really is, an unlikely egalitarian in tweeds. But he’s an imprudent one too: by investing his wife’s millions in a Canadian railway that goes bankrupt, Grantham places all his loved ones in peril.Worse occurred in real life, of course. Much worse. Take the brutal, polluting mills and mines, like so many plantation fields, that often lay just outside the gates.Of course, Downton isn’t real. So, to stay in the realm of art, consider Shipley, the neo-Palladian masterpiece DH Lawrence invented for Lady Chatterley’s Lover. There, Squire Leslie Winter talks of the miners who work his pits with all the condescension a planter might have for his slaves.Chatting with the Prince of Wales, Winter quips: “The miners are perhaps not so ornamental as deer, but they are far more profitable.”HRH replies: “If there were coal under Sandringham, I would open a mine on the lawns and think it first-rate landscape gardening. Oh, I am quite willing to exchange roe-deer for colliers, at the price.”In the real world, many fine homes have been lost. Their deaths, like their lives, are all about the money.In Lawrence’s book, the squire dies and his heirs tear down his hall to build semi-detached “villas” for workers. Lady Chatterley is shocked to learn such people are as capable of love as she is. One suspects Fellowes, the author of a novel called Snobs, no less, might feel a similar shock if told us ordinary people who love Downton, his facile but beautiful and seductive creation, are capable of sincere feeling too.We are. And while we are equipped to daydream of such luxury for ourselves, or to pick nits with Fellowes’ staging while we swoon at his stars in their gorgeous firmament, we are also the heirs to those who did all the work, those who built the Downtons and the plantations.We know a profound truth behind all their costly beauty and misery. Every stately home, in every land, belongs to us too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d060e7c06df5c330cc6e23527d666543f2911cc1/0_273_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44e49251f8ebd4be0bde5e1b25020427","title":"norfolk slows down coastal erosion with sandscaping scheme","story":"Sand from Great Yarmouth seabed creates mobile dune defences to protect villagesAn artificial dune of nearly 2m cubic metres of sand has been created on the Norfolk coast in an innovative approach to slowing coastal erosion.In the £20m sandscaping scheme, enough sand to fill one and a half Wembley stadiums has been dredged from existing North Sea seabed extraction sites off Great Yarmouth and ferried to the rapidly eroding coastline beside the large gas terminal at Bacton.Nearly four miles (6km) of coastline has been replenished with new sand, deposited up to seven metres deep in places in an irregular form so the wind can create dunes to buffer the soft sandy cliffs. Although the sand is expected to erode and move with storms and currents, the project’s engineers say it will buy 15 to 20 more years for a coastline where seaside communities are predicted to have to move inland later this century because of rising seas caused by the climate crisis.Villages to the south of Bacton have blamed increased erosion on the concrete sea defences around the gas terminal. These have prevented the natural movement of sediment from sandy cliffs drifting southwards to replenish neighbouring beaches.The new mobile defences are calculated to work with the longshore drift which will carry the sand southwards where it will protect other coastal villages that are increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis.It is the first scheme of its kind outside the Netherlands where the Zandmotor project used 10 times as much sand to protect a half-mile stretch of coastline in south Holland.The Dutch engineering company that designed the project has identified up to 20 coastal locations where sandscaping could be used, including Lincolnshire and the shingle coast at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. The company is currently discussing with Cornwall county council a potential sandscaping solution in Penzance where coastal erosion threatens the railway line.Jaap Flikweert, the coastal management adviser for Royal HaskoningDHV, said the Norfolk project was “a little nephew of Zandmotor”. “It’s less radical and it looks like a big, slightly more curvy beach nourishment scheme … it sticks out less from the shoreline but this is the best concept for the clients,” he said.Local people at Walcott in Norfolk – where the 2013 storms wrecked homes – welcomed the scheme but pointed to the loss of 1 metre of sand from the lower part of the beach since it was placed there in August. “A lot of it seems to have disappeared already,” said Ken Crowe. “I hope it does what it set out to do. Time will tell.”“People say the beach used to be like this 60 years ago,” said Cathy Kerby. “It’s improved the beach for everyone … we trust the experts know what they are doing and it will work.”According to Flikweert, some sand will be moved by the tides and currents and will disappear on to offshore sand banks in the winter but is expected to return in the summer. “That’s the dynamic of the beach. Of course it looks worrying, especially for local people, but that’s how it works.”The Zandmotor scheme in south Holland has surpassed initial expectations. The natural sea defence was expected to last for 20 years but a recent analysis suggested it could last twice as long.The Bacton project caused controversy in the spring when netting placed on the cliffs prevented returning sand martins from nesting in their regular holes. However, according to Natural England which monitored the sand martins, the birds dug new nest holes nearby and enjoyed a successful nesting season with as many birds as before. The new sand is also expected to provide habitat for shore-nesting birds such as ringed plover.Two-thirds of the £20m British scheme has been funded by the owners of Bacton gas terminal – including Shell – with £5m from the Environment Agency and additional funding from councils.Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “The climate crisis requires innovation and collaboration between countries, organisations, sectors and communities. The Bacton to Walcott scheme is a model for other climate resilience projects, protecting key national infrastructure while also delivering added coastal protection to the local villages.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a566e13a0e577da0431900841ebdb135bb2c17a2/0_134_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d63c1b6a63e69b08c00b134f6b30cc5","title":"nature conservancys global photo contest winners 2019","story":"The global conservation body Nature Conservancy, working in 72 countries to tackle climate change and to conserve lands, waters and oceans, has announced its latest photo winners, selected from more than 100,000 entries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe4bdde43b71fa97ecd26d181717f417a7ab4aa/0_0_4269_2952/master/4269.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b37ca1b3212c10eff42b3936e2688f0 720w","title":"high octane glitz for versace as j lo brings the house down","story":"The actor’s appearance in ‘That’ dress from 2000 had the crowd in Milan whoopingOne of the lesser-known aspects of Versace’s brand mythology is its role in the inception of Google Images.The story goes like this. In the year 2000 – as fashion scholars will recall – Jennifer Lopez wore a sheer, low-cut green Versace dress to the Grammys. “The whole world wanted to see that dress,” said Donatella Versace at a press conference in Milan on Friday. And so the world surfed the net – as we used to say – but couldn’t find the picture within the mainly text-based system. And lo, Google Images was born.The gown – inevitably known as ‘That’ Dress – melted the internet again when it appeared on the catwalk at Versace’s springsummer show on Friday. Donatella teased the audience at first, using its print on tote bags, hooded jackets and denim skirt suits, its palm fronds interpreted as crystallised details on pool sliders and appliquéd on shirts.At the end of the show, Jennifer Lopez herself appeared in the dress, in a move that had US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour beaming and the upstanding, whooping, Instagram-posting fashion crowd proclaiming it even more spectacular than the moment, in 2017, when the designer reunited five supermodels.Even before J-Lo turned up, the show felt cranked up to 11, quite a feat for a brand so seeped in glitz and hedonism. All the biggest Insta supermodels – Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kendal Jenner and Vogue cover star Kaia Gerber – were there. The music pumped while palm tree fronds were projected on to floor-to-ceiling digital screens on the walls.The clothes were larger-than-life, literally, being a millennial take on 80s power dressing. Exaggerated proportions – T-shirts and cardigans with rolled shoulders built in and leg o’mutton sleeves on trench coats and leather dresses – ensured even the most waif-like models took up space as they strode down the catwalk. The Versace-logoed T-shirts and marble dyed tights were social media catnip.It was all strategically choreographed, of course. In September 2018, Versace – until then famously one of the last family businesses standing in fashion – was acquired for $2.1bn by Michael Kors Holdings, which then rebranded to Capri Holdings. With Versace, Michael Kors and luxury shoe label Jimmy Choo under its umbrella, Capri Holdings aims to become the first American luxury conglomerate to rival French behemoths LVMH and Kering. Versace is key to that growth, with the company seeking to double revenues and open 112 more stores by 2022.Versace was one of the brands that signed up to the Fashion Pact, launched at the G7 summit in August, and as such has pledged to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and protect and restore natural ecosystems and oceans.The environmental impact of this particular show and collection was, at time of press, unconfirmed by the brand. There had been a lot of talk of tree-planting and carbon offsetting at some of the other shows this fashion month. At this show a tree was actually erected but it was part of the set – a 9-metre-tall gilded statue of a palm, which felt very Versace.You wondered whether some attendants might object to such high-octane glitz on global climate strike day. But with the ultimate feel-good moment of Jennifer Lopez strutting down the catwalk and Donatella Versace beaming beside her such concerns were too easy to forget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92896ef1e529e133eee6eb2d6fc2c631aa084880/906_501_4690_2814/master/4690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb587c04f1e62e2e48578cb31d47c64","title":"mum wanted me to have clothes shopping grief","story":"We had always shared the fun of fashion. Now she was dying, I found comfort in silk blouses and glitter platformsAs my mother lay dying on a hospital bed, I went shopping. After long days at her bedside, doing my best to buoy her spirits, helping her sip water from a cup because she was too weak to hold it, after almost daily round-trips from home by rail to that hospital in my old stomping grounds, my shopping urges became fairly frequent. As the toll of her illness and slow painful death overwhelmed me, I shopped, then some more, and then some.Neither of us knew she was dying at first. My mother was tired and ready, she often told me, to shuffle off at 84. Her body was a bit of a wreck but her brain still worked she still cared about the cryptic crossword and the state of the Labour party. It encouraged me to hear of her antics during the morning medical catch-ups, and so her death just didn’t fit into my picture, even when a bumbling junior doctor took me aside to tell me she was very ill indeed.Having recently left a big career and sold a big house to make a transatlantic move to be nearby, as she grew old in her housing association flat in Bromley (the same flat I grew up in), facing her death was something I could not contemplate. I listened to the doctor but did not hear. Instead, I thought about shoes.Freestyle spending became my opiate, a life-affirming pastime and a happy place, away from the despair of critical patients and weeping families. Silk blouses, boots, eyeshadow palettes and undies are pretty, after all, and taking them home made my world a bit beautiful. I don’t remember showing her anything, but she did notice and admire a rather fabulous 60s cut vinyl coat. The term retail therapy, coined in 1986 by the Chicago Tribune and defined as shopping to improve the mood of the buyer during periods of stress or depression, is often casually or comically applied to periods of intense spending, especially by women. For me, there was nothing funny about it. As I stared from train windows, stumbled through hospital corridors, met social workers, safe-guarders, test-givers and an occasional doctor, contemplating a trip to the shops subdued my escalating emotional pain.I’m not the only one. So common is it, that researchers at Melbourne University have advocated spending as therapy as a psychological disorder called oniomania, existing on a spectrum with shopping addiction or compulsive buying disorder. Like any addiction, it comes with a withdrawal and comedown period unless you keep shopping, of course. The good news is that an oniomania tendency is often short-lived.My mum and I had always connected over clothes common ground in a relationship that was at times isive, although no more so than most we were simply different women separated by generations and expectations. As a kid in Canada, she would take me off to get the latest haircut, dress me in nice frocks and was always at the top of her fashion game. Over the years I had become used to sharing the fun of fashion with her. She was always eager to discuss her own life in clothes, and kept the standout pieces long after she was able to wear them. She was my first style icon I remember her sitting at a Singer sewing machine, or with knitting needles working wool into a bouclé poncho – maybe in a pantsuit, always wearing a nude Revlon lipstick.After my mother died, I had to clear her flat, which no one tells you can be one of the most painful parts of the process, sifting through all those memories, all those feelings, all those things. In her bedroom I found an unused Oscar de la Renta for Vogue kaftan pattern from 1973 I know this because she dated the envelope. It felt like a direct message from her, a special gift.In the months immediately after my mother died I continued to shop, filling the hole that grief ripped through me with yet more stuff and a new mantra: “Mum would have wanted me to have this.” Beautiful things made me feel better. Putting on something a bit fabulous made it easier to leave the house on my darkest days, and it wasn’t just about clothes. I had to hear live music, stand in front of great art, live large for my mum because she no longer could. A lot of my purchases were frivolous, but I think she would have heartily approved of the green glitter platform shoes I bought for a landmark birthday party.Before that birthday, when friends rallied round my daughter and me, proving there can be love in grief, there was another, much more significant outfit to choose. As her youngest child and the only one able to attend her funeral, I had to choose what my mother would wear in her coffin. I picked a dress she had made herself – a long navy number with a delicate gold pattern and cuffed sleeves, as much a tribute to her lifelong creativity as it was a glamorous goodbye: she had been born into a family of war women who sewed and knitted and put themselves together beautifully, but had little money. A scarf to hide her neck malformed by cervical dystonia, the onset of which led my proud mother to become ashamed of her appearance, to stay indoors much more than she should, pinned with a maple leaf brooch to honour the country that was her home for over 20 years and where three of her children were born.I chose not to see her in that last ensemble but, as the coffin was carried in, I imagined her as she had been, and the only way I choose to remember her now: stylish and beautiful. I wore an old black and white dress, a new coat and a large Air Force Blue hat, to honour her days in the post-war Women’s Royal Air Force.As the months passed my grief lifted, and my shopping compulsion has been put to rest. I now think more than twice about buying things. I envisage my daughter having to get rid of all the stuff when I’ve gone. I hope that’s a long way off, but I will still pencil in a Swedish Death Cleaning in about 20 years. My talented girl is doing brilliantly well in sewing classes, carrying on a family tradition, and doing her part for the slow fashion revolution.I like to think some of my shopkeeper friends miss me. I met some wonderful women on those excursions, women with their own grief stories, who were kind enough to share them. I still pop in for chats now and again, but the debit card stays in the wallet.I have many regrets about my mother’s death – what I did or didn’t do – but not about the shopping. I acknowledge the comfort it gave me, and cannot say it will never happen again. The second anniversary of her birthday since she died is fast approaching, and I plan to make that kaftan at last. I’m going to wear it somewhere she loved and that holds special memories. If you see me swanning about in it, please don’t ask me where I bought it. I made it myself, and won’t be buying anything to cheer myself up.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bac22b74d6a151f6ca9d6ffc588af10836a029e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8960c7a98a1f328090371f38059d80a","title":"strap in the 10 best high street bags in pictures","story":"From backpack to bucket, padded to patterned: there are bags to suit all tastes this season"},{"url":null,"title":"i met my girlfriends parents and realised i had once slept with her father","story":"She is everything to me and I was going to propose – but now he has told me to end it with herFive years ago, I went through a bi phase and used to sleep around with pretty much everyone that came along, including other men.

This is the true story of having – and losing – a superpowerby  Caroline Rothstein with illustrations by Hokyoung Kim for NarrativelyOn 10 March 2009, a case was filed in the US circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, where I grew up. Rothstein v American Airlines, Inc starred my father, Plaintiff Steven Rothstein, and the defendant, then the world’s third-largest airline. With $23bn in annual revenue, American Airlines had nothing to lose. For my father, it was a last-ditch effort to save his life.Here’s how it all took off. In the early 1980s, American rolled out AAirpass, a prepaid membership program that let very frequent flyers purchase discounted tickets by locking in a certain number of annual miles they presumed they might fly in advance. My 30-something-year-old father, having been a frequent flyer for his entire life, purchased one. Then, a few years later, American introduced something straight out of an avid traveler’s fantasy: an unlimited ticket.In 1987, amid a lucrative year as a Bear Stearns stockbroker, my father became one of only a few dozen people on earth to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass. A quarter of a million dollars gave him access to fly first class anywhere in the world on American for the rest of his life. He flew so much it paid for itself. Often he’d leave in the morning for a business trip, fly back, and I hadn’t even known he’d left. Other times, I remember calling his office to find out what country he was in. He (and our whole family) was featured on NBC’s Today Show in 2003, and then on MSNBC in 2006. For 20 years, he was one of American’s top fliers, accumulating more than 30 million miles, which he acquired every time he flew, even with the AAirpass.Then, on 13 December 2008, American took the AAirpass away.For several years, the revenues department at American had been monitoring my father and other AAirpass holders to see how much their golden tickets were costing the airline in lost revenue. After 20 years, it seems, they’d decided the pass wasn’t such a good idea. My father was one of several lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders American claimed had breached their contracts.A few months later, my father sued American for breaking their deal, and more importantly, taking away something integral to who he was. The legal fight went on for years without going to trial. The story became front-page news. The Los Angeles Times. The New York Post. Fox News. A slew of online outlets. It’s even a perennially popular conversation topic on Reddit.The obvious story is that my father was a decadent jet-setter who either screwed or got screwed by American depends on your take. The coverage is always sensational. And I think – as does my whole family, including my dad – that at the very least, it doesn’t quite land.Legend goes, upon bringing me to O’Hare airport as a baby, my father said, “This is daddy’s playground.”Dad has loved to travel for his entire life. His father, Josh, was a navigator in the army air corps during the second world war and ran a company that manufactured paper and artificial flowers, traveling worldwide and telling stories about the places he went.“When I was nine,” Dad tells me, “we went to Denver. When he left in the morning to go on his business appointments, he said to me: stay at the pool, charge your lunch to the room, and I’ll see you at dinnertime. Make sure you have your tie on.”When he was 16, Dad’s parents took him on a three-and-a-half-week trip: New York–San Francisco–Honolulu–Kamuela–Tokyo–Nagoya–Osaka–Okinawa–Taipei–Hong Kong–Calcutta–Karachi–Tehran–Rome–Florence–Nice–London–New York.“I began to taste, directly, the fervor of foreign travel,” he tells me. “I felt as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York … I was a child of the world.”He wrote his college application on a typewriter at a hotel beach in Hawaii and mailed it from a post office in Osaka. In college he worked for a travel agency helping students book standby flights at low fares, which he utilized himself. “I was on my own and could go anywhere at a moment’s notice,” he reminisces. He flew to Europe several times a year and went to live there after graduating in 1972.That December, he joined the wallet business – a company my grandfather had purchased – doing sales. He had an apartment in Manhattan on East 89th Street, but mostly, he was at the wallet factory in Oklahoma, or traveling, both for work and play. On the weekends, he’d rush to Houston, Dallas, Wichita Falls, Mexico City or Acapulco, then back to work on Monday.“Steven got on a plane like most people get on a bus,” says my mom, Nancy Rothstein, who was married to my father for 36 years.Transitioning to finance, Dad moved to Chicago in 1976 for a stint at Smith Barney and, according to him, became the second-highest-grossing stockbroker at Bear Stearns in 1979, where he worked for a decade. Later, he focused on investment banking, and also became the largest shareholder of the financial corporation Olympic Cascade, the holding company of a brokerage firm, National Securities. Through it all, he continued flying. Everywhere. Airports and airplanes – they were who Dad was.When American started the AAdvantage program, Dad and Uncle Shelly (Mom’s uncle and one of Dad’s best friends and business associates) began flying even more than they already did. Then, after a good year at Bear, the investment in an unlimited pass made sense.In September 1987, five months after my brother, Josh, was born, and three months after we moved from downtown Chicago into the north suburbs, Dad bought his unlimited lifetime AAirpass. The cost was $250,000, which the agreement stated was based on his age. My father was 37 years and four days old when he dated the check.Two years later, which was one year before my younger sister, Natalie, was born, he added a companion feature to his AAirpass, allowing him to bring another person along on any flight. The cost was $150,000, based on his being 39 years old. This changed the game, not only for him, but our entire family.Ernie Thurmond, a former American employee who handled Dad’s AAirpass contracts, helped with adding some special stipulations. My parents decided early on to take separate planes so that in the unlikely event of a crash, at least one of them would be alive for their three children. So the agreement amendment stated: “If spouse is the companion, the spouse will be allowed to travel separately from Holder, provided that the spouse travels on the flight immediately prior to or just after the flight taken by Holder.” My parents wouldn’t fly on the same plane for at least a decade after that.Major US and global hubs became Dad’s office American became his home. He knew every employee on his journey – from the curb, through security, to the gate, and on to the plane.In the early 1990s, Dad found his go-to agent at the American Airlines Platinum desk: Lorraine Cross from Raleigh, North Carolina. None of us has ever met her in person. But Lorraine was family, her southern lilt a speakerphone staple at the dinner table. While my father befriended dozens and dozens of American employees throughout his tenure as one of their top fliers, no one played a role quite like Lorraine.Lorraine and Dad became fast pals. Over the next decade-plus, he’d send Lorraine – and others at Platinum – postcards from Maine when he took us to sleepaway camp, menus from restaurants around the world, and magazines from foreign airport lounges. Lorraine loved receiving these she’s even kept the postcards after all these years.She says they shared inside jokes – a lot. “Every time I talked to your father, as we would close the conversation – I’m southern – I would always say, ‘Bye now.’ … That was my closing. He would say, ‘Pay later.’ Caroline, we used to laugh all the time.”Lorraine and the other Platinum desk employees weren’t his only pals. Recently, Dad described himself as being “like an adopted child”. American – and its employees – were his parents. He knew the skycaps at O’Hare, LaGuardia, JFK, Heathrow, LAX the people at the front desk at the Admirals Club pre-departure lounges flight attendants on hauls he frequently flew the gate attendants and the folks who drove the carts from security to the gate, like Aamil.Aamil – whose name I’ve changed to respect his privacy – was a refugee who fled the Bosnian genocide with his family. Dad met Aamil when he was in high school, driving a cart at O’Hare, and took him under his wing – errands and various paid-for-hire tasks. Ultimately, Aamil started coming over for dinner picked us up at school became Josh’s “big brother” ears for his dating rendezvous as he entered high school and was both an employee and a dear, dear friend.Dad “was gracious and kind in a way you don’t see in a lot of people”, Lorraine says, recollecting the time he helped fly some priests to Italy to see the Vatican, or when Mom called her from the local Gap to use miles to help a sales clerk visit her mother.Dad gifted the miles and upgrades he accumulated throughout his life – both before and during his AAirpass tenure – to dozens and dozens of people. Once he upgraded my cantor and his wife to first class from Amsterdam. He regularly let relatives and people in crisis come along in his extra seat. There was the time he took my brother’s best friend on his first airplane ever to see a football game the American Airlines employee he saw in India, crying because she might lose her job if she didn’t make it to Toronto his brother and sister-in-law for their honeymoon a guy from college and his wife who really wanted to go to Australia a man in the back office at National Securities, who wanted to visit his dying father (he got there just in time). “Your family’s heart is as big as the state of Texas,” Lorraine says. “It’s incredible how many lives they touched and how many lives touched them because they’re very sensitive and attuned to what goes on in the world.”I’m not saying Dad was a saint. Just that his AAirpass was about more than solipsistic travel. It allowed him to build relationships. And it allowed other people to access the world like he did. That’s what Dad’s AAirpass and ultra-elite flying status yielded for him: lifelong bonds.On 13 January 1998, the American Airlines CEO, Robert Crandall, wrote my father a letter after they’d seen each other on the Concorde (a transatlantic supersonic aircraft).At the end, Crandall wrote: I am delighted that you’ve enjoyed your AAirpass investment – you can count on us to keep the Company solid, and to honor the deal, far into the future.My friend Phil likes to say my father ran his life like a corporation and raised me in it. His underwear was pressed. UPS and FedEx came nightly to our driveway to drop things off, pick things up. He had packing down to a science – sets of clothes folded and fitted into plastic cases, cosmetics ready to go. We had a whole suitcase closet in the basement, and at some point, he turned the downstairs guest room into a staging area for packing.“They sort of broke the mold when they made him,” says Mom, who is a sleep consultant.He stored everything he collected while traveling in the basement – hotel soaps, shampoos, conditioners his thickened old passports towels shirts hairdryers and combs from around the world – in what we called his “Secret Room”, the key hidden in his office desk. A fun party trick was bringing people inside – his business associates, my siblings and my friends. Sometimes we used the items ourselves. Often, we gave things away. After Hurricane Katrina, Dad and I flew down to New Orleans with boxes of clothes and toiletries. When he went to India, he brought things along. Like travel, for Dad, the Secret Room was an extension of souvenir collecting as a kid.As a kid myself, I often complained about Dad’s excessive traveling. I used words like “abandonment” and “neglect”. In retrospect, that was wildly dramatic. But it’s how I felt.“No matter where Steven went, there wasn’t a day we didn’t talk,” Mom says. “Some men are home every night at 5.30 from the office, but they’re not really there. Steven Rothstein was there.” She emphasizes there with a deep, grinding grunt. “Whether he was in the house or out of the house, he was very involved. He was very much there. And always in touch. I mean, he used a phone … he was one of the first people with a cellphone.”She’s right. Most of my life, I focused on how Dad was always on a plane. When I think about it now, when he was home, he was there: sitting with me on my bedroom floor, or at the dinner table, or coming in to kiss me goodnight. He has a presence. Not only a loud voice, but also a boom of self. He arrives. He is both taking off and landing at once.“He never missed an opportunity to come home to the family,” Lorraine says. “I don’t care where he was going. I don’t care what he was doing. If there was a chance he could come home and stay with his family overnight, he preferred that to any hotel in the world.“I really valued and appreciated that from him,” she says. “His family meant the most. I would say, ‘That’s a long way to go, are you gonna overnight and come back the next day?’ He’d go, ‘No, I wanna sleep in my own bed. I wanna go home. I wanna be with my family.’”I laugh, tears in my eyes. I didn’t know this.“That was crucial to him, to be with his family,” Lorraine says. “He did some crazy stuff to make that happen over the years.”Dad was an airport celebrity, and when we traveled together, it embarrassed the shit out of me. Like riding a cart from security to the gate (because as a family, we ran late – Dad has a knack for rushed arrivals). I would bow my head so I couldn’t make eye contact with anyone we passed. Or walking into the Admirals Club locations and having the folks at the front desk know us by name.Or when, in second grade, he took me to Japan for the weekend because he wanted me to experience an inaugural flight (San Jose to Tokyo). We were in the bulkhead, the first row of any flight cabin. As we landed, there were reporters flooding the jet bridge to photograph the first person off the flight. Technically, based on his seat, that was Dad. But as he figured out what was happening, he insisted I go first so I could be the star. I stood there with my seven-year-old smile, bright-colored headband, and long V-neck Limited Too sweater hanging down to my thighs.I was mortified. But Dad wanted us to experience absolutely everything there was in life.He wanted to take me to all 50 states by the time I was 11. We put a big US map on the wall behind his home office desk. After each trip, I’d add a pin to the visited state another for the places I wanted to go. When we’d gone to 30-something states, I asked to stop I wanted to be able to have new adventures as an adult.“You grew up with a different lens than most people you knew,” Mom says. “I’m not saying … that other people didn’t travel all over the world. But I sort of doubt, for the most part, they had the kind of wanderlust and open-mindedness and fascination that your father had with the world, and still does, for that matter.“Yes,” I answer.“Not only framed you,” she adds, “but it helped with your, your tapestry. It was woven into your tapestry. Into the fabric of who you are, and how you look at other people and the world.”I understood the weight and privilege as a kid. I understood – we all did – that the AAirpass meant my father could travel and do business in unprecedented ways, and it allowed our entire family to travel in ways few people on earth could. We got the privileges, all of them, all of us.I ask my sister, Natalie, a psychotherapist living in Chicago, her earliest memories of traveling on an airplane: landing in Australia at age three, walking down the aisle as the plane was still moving, and someone grabbing her to keep her safe. “I think I remember that because it was really dramatic,” she says. “I have a lot of vivid memories from that trip, actually.”“Were you aware that we were in first class?” I ask.“I didn’t sit out of first class until I was 12 years old,” she says. “I don’t know if I was aware when I was three years old. But I was aware very early.”Wont to interrogate privilege – race, class and otherwise – I pry. Did she really get that first class was different than the rest of the plane?“For a long time, I really wanted to sit in coach,” she says, “because I felt uncomfortable being a kid in first class when it was clearly where all fancy adults were sitting. It was clear I was surrounded by mostly people who had a lot of money, and I was always one of the only kids in first class, and that felt weird and I always wanted to be with other kids in coach.”That trip to Australia (I was in fifth grade) was our first big international family vacation. The following year, Dad, on a whim, said to Mom: let’s go to Tokyo.“Japan!” she said. “Over Christmas? Are you kidding?”But we went.Mom can still perfectly picture us all at dusk in Tokyo: “Dad has on his camel coat. You and Josh are in all the black-and-white-check stuff. We’re walking through an aisle of stalls … going to yet another monastery or shrine and the flavors that we felt and saw and tasted … it was probably one of the best Christmas vacations we’d ever had because we were the only people in the hotel.” She starts chuckling. “And it was so much fun. It was so unusual to be Americans at Christmas in Tokyo.“It was about seeing the world … We wanted to connect to the people,” she says. As she recounts these stories, her tone is somewhere between euphoric and frenzied. She punctuates each story with an “oh my God” and transitions immediately into the next.“When we were in India … we got so friendly with our cab driver that we brought him for dinner to the hotel … For a while we were in touch … We would send him pictures and things. That was the kind of richness that this AAirpass, this sense of a family traveling anywhere we wanted to go in the world that American could take us – that’s what we did. People enriched us. Hopefully we enriched others.”She starts laughing as she recalls a time we visited the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Dad got in trouble for lying down with his yoga strap, trying to stretch his back in front of the church. “I mean, there was so much color in what we did and where we went and how we did it. The travel was first class, the hotels were first class, but the experiences were very real and authentic.” And then without skipping a beat, she goes up an octave with: “Oh my God … so Josh was dead when we first went to India, right?”“Josh was dead both times we went to India,” I say.“Yeah,” she says. “But he was very much with us, I’m sure.”On 6 October 2002, Josh – 15 and a half – was hit by a car while walking down the sidewalk. The car had pulled an illegal U-turn. To avoid a collision, another driver accidentally accelerated, swerved up on to the sidewalk and flung Josh into the side of a building. His head hit the building. He was knocked unconscious. My uncle Jeffrey called me from Scarsdale and told me to get on a plane. It was my first month of college I rushed to the Philadelphia airport and bought a ticket home. I landed at O’Hare, descended to baggage claim, into more uncle’s arms. Their faces distraught: It doesn’t look good. It would be at least another 15 years before I could descend the American Airlines baggage claim escalator without going into a trauma shock.Josh died the next morning – our rabbi and the hospital chaplain reciting the end of life Hebrew blessings and prayers Dad, Natalie, our maternal grandmother, and me standing around the bed Mom’s own body draped alongside her dying son Natalie’s hand on his heart for his last beat.Over a thousand people attended his funeral. Lorraine helped get people on flights. I remember a family friend walking through the front door of our home after a flight from Australia, as if she’d taken a bus.To say Josh’s death broke Dad would be an understatement. Ernie from American says it was sad to watch Dad when they occasionally saw each other over the years. “He’s not the same person any more,” Ernie says.Josh was Dad’s little buddy. His only son. He’d already lost his father in 1989, and he would soon lose the companionship of Uncle Shelly, when Shelly had a stroke.“People react to tragedy in different ways,” Lorraine says. “He let Josh’s death take the best of him away … Outwardly, his strength was renowned. But I knew how much it impacted him … I know his children meant more to him than any business deal, than any situation in life that could come up.”Right after Josh died, Dad leaned on people like Lorraine, and other agents and employees, which I hadn’t known until writing this piece. I had asked Dad what the media tends to overlook when they cover this story.“When everyone was asleep in the house,” he tells me, “and I had nobody to talk to, and I was lonely about Josh’s death, I would telephone American Airlines reservations and speak to the agents about who knows what for an hour and then at the end, they’d ask me, oh, what reservation was I calling about to make, and I would say, ‘Oh yeah, I need to go to San Francisco next week.’ I really didn’t need to go to San Francisco. I was just very confused and very lonely and I was calling American Airlines because they were logical people for me to speak to. They knew me. I knew them. I knew their names. I knew their lives.”I tell Dad this makes sense, to lean on the community you know in a time of need.“I traveled all over the world,” he says. “Going from the front of American Airlines to the gate, I might see a dozen people, each of whom would say hello to me, and I would say hello to all of them.” Dad says that about 10 American Airlines employees came to Josh’s funeral. “That’s an extremely unusual relationship for a passenger to have with the airlines.”I talk to Natalie, who was still at home with a front row seat to his grief while I was away at college. She tells me about the shame Dad felt when people in our community often pitied him after Josh died – and still do – as if he were a broken man. But the airport and American were where he was still treated like a full, whole man.“His community at American treated him like a normal human, and walking through the airport, they didn’t treat him like he was broken, the way a lot of his other worlds did,” she says. “It was the only sense of normalcy that he still had.”Six years and two months later, Dad arrived at O’Hare with Aamil, who needed to go to Sarajevo but didn’t have the cash, so Dad offered to fly him to London on his AAirpass and then pay for his London hotel and airfare from there to Sarajevo.“ I went into the ticket counter. I checked in my luggage for London. I walked to the gate … and just as I was walking on the plane, they handed me a letter terminating the AAirpass,” Dad recounts. “Why did they let me go to the gate? Why didn’t they tell me up front, which would have been the nice thing to do?”Turns out a letter had been drafted to notify Dad that they were concerned with his behavior and use of the pass. But they decided not to send it. They didn’t want the bad press – what it might mean to terminate a lifetime AAirpass from a frequent flyer. So they terminated it without warning, at the airport – a punch right into Dad’s proverbial heart.Even Lorraine hadn’t been notified. “I walked in one day from work,” she said in a deposition, “and received notification that the AAirpass had been terminated. I was probably more shocked than anyone else.” No warning. No input sought, even though she had been regularly managing his and other top fliers’ bookings.Dad’s luggage went to London. They wouldn’t help him get it back. Aamil never made it to Sarajevo. In fact, that was one of the last times they ever spoke. Ultimately, Aamil disappeared from our lives.Dad doesn’t think Aamil understood the “shock and horror” of what had happened. Dad went home. Told Mom. Got in bed. And slept for the rest of the weekend, and arguably – at least figuratively – for a really long time after that. “I was in disbelief,” he recalls. “I was in shock. And I had no idea how I was going to live my life the way I lived it.”The AAirpass was Dad’s lifeline. His blood. Mom described his relationship with it as “sacrosanct”. There was a contract. Rules. It was his superpower. He didn’t ever want to do anything wrong.But American claimed he did.Dad was one of a few lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders that American had been monitoring and claimed had breached their contracts. They claimed Dad made “speculative bookings” and a host of other things that they interpreted as objectionable based on a clause in the contract about “fraudulent usage”.“When I bought the AAirpass, in no uncertain terms, they told me that there was only one rule: I couldn’t give anybody the AAirpass,” Dad says. “And those were the days before they took identification from passengers.” A former colleague had once offered him five grand a week to use the AAirpass. Dad told the guy he was “crazy”.But now, after years of secret investigation, apparently Dad and others were costing American too much money. Though Dad had dealt with the reservations agents on an almost daily basis, it was the revenues department that got involved, interjected, and launched an investigation that brought the whole house down.On 10 March 2009, Dad sued American for breaking their deal, claiming $7m in damages. The dollar amount was based on the value of the lifetime unlimited AAirpass the last time it was sold for public consumption – though American had stopped selling them in 1994, a 2004 Neiman Marcus catalogue offered them for 3 million bucks. So it was the Neiman’s figure plus estimated costs for first-class travel for the rest of his life.A primary issue in the case was whether American properly terminated his AAirpass Agreement based on Section 12, which read:12. FRAUDULENT USAGE. If American determines that an AAirpass has been fraudulently used, American reserves the right to revoke the AAirpass and all privileges associated with it. Holder will thereupon forfeit all rights to the AAirpass, without refund, and will return the AAirpass card and this Agreement shall terminate.They claimed that his “fraudulent usage” included booking empty seats for his companion feature under “Bag Rothstein” or “Steven Rothstein Jr” (which they had for years condoned, and Mom says was not Dad’s idea), as well as “booking speculative reservations” – ie, flight reservations he was allegedly never planning to actually take.Dad believes there was someone at American who decided, “Oh, if these guys didn’t have these goddamn AAirpasses, it would be great.”According to Lorraine and the legal documents, a longtime American employee launched the investigation, looking into several other AAirpass holders, including Dad and Jacques Vroom, another lifetime unlimited customer, whose AAirpass termination also resulted in a lawsuit.(I reached out to American Airlines for comment on this article. Their media relations representative said: “We are pleased to continue to provide AirPass benefits to eligible cardholders when enjoyed in conjunction with the appropriate program conditions.” They said they did not have anything to add beyond what’s already in the court documents.)Truth is, AAirpass was – even in its earliest, earliest days – a failed program. It didn’t yield the revenue they’d hoped. In 2017, one writer listed the lifetime unlimited AAirpass as number one on the “7 Worst Marketing Disasters in human history”. In fact, when AAirpass started, according to Ernie, American thought they’d make “hundreds of millions of dollars” selling them, but they did not. “It became painful,” Ernie says. He says he tried several times to get them to shut it down they didn’t want to admit defeat.As for the case, American anticipated a resolution without a trial Dad anticipated a trial by jury. Instead, everything happened in legal offices, calls, motions and documents, judges’ chambers and depositions. They spent the summer of 2009 debating – back and forth – over the fraud clause, and whether it was ambiguous or clear.Then, American counterclaimed, saying Dad broke the contract by improperly using the companion feature. In early 2010, they claimed, “Rothstein had a history of making speculative, fictitious, impossible andor illogical reservations on behalf of companions.” They claimed these “companions” were people with whom he “had no intention of traveling”.The senior analyst who launched the investigation reviewed and analyzed Dad’s flight records, and claimed “that between December 2003 and April 2004, Steven Rothstein made companion reservations using ‘Steven Rothstein, Jr.’ using for his AAirpass companion feature for at least 41 flight segments”. But again, they had condoned his booking companion seats under fictitious names for years. In April 2004, an American employee had approached Dad and asked him to stop, as security measures around flying had clearly started to shift after September 11. So he stopped.But they continued investigating him, looking for a way to push him out.Another document shows that American contends that 14 incidents from August 2006 to November 2008 were considered “fraudulent” under their alleged terms – but Dad was never notified that they were considered fraudulent at the time they were made.In her deposition, Lorraine said she hadn’t received any written directions from American Airlines regarding what was and was not “acceptable practice for making reservations for the Executive Platinum customers”.Lorraine said, both in her deposition and our interview, that she didn’t suspect misuse of his AAirpass they were the ones handling all of his bookings. Yet, they – Lorraine, and anyone else in reservations – weren’t contacted at all once revenues began the investigations.Mom chuckles when she recalls sitting in the federal judge’s chambers with the attorneys in 2010 as American noted his making “fraudulent reservations”.“Steven never made a single reservation on his own on a computer,” she says. “Every single reservation he ever made was made with an American Airlines paid employee.” Dad didn’t use a computer. He was the first person I knew to have a cellphone, and then the first person I knew to get a BlackBerry (and remains one of the last to have one). To write letters, he’d use an electric typewriter or audio-record memos on his Dictaphone and mail mini cassette tapes to his secretary to type and then fax or mail accordingly. But a computer – never. Still doesn’t.Ernie says Dad found creative ways to use his AAirpass, even though Ernie knows of other cardholders who absolutely violated the terms of use – letting others use it, getting paid. “He would be at the airport waiting to board an airplane by himself,” Ernie says, “and he would meet somebody at, like, the Admirals Club and get into a conversation with them and they’re on the same flight he is and he said, ‘Well, why don’t we continue this conversation on the airplane? Let me go check and see if they’ve got any open seats in first class,’ and he would invite that person to join him.“It was not prohibited by the language of the contract,” Ernie says. “But it was not intended to be used like that … I don’t think Steve did anything that was directly or intentionally trying to do something that was … against the rules. Certainly it took some interpretation on American’s part to go after him.”Seven third-party witnesses connected to Dad – family members, friends and business associates – were interviewed during discovery. They were questioned by American around the “speculative bookings” that were deemed retroactively fraudulent.Sometimes Dad would spontaneously book a flight for him and a companion – say, taking my aunt to visit my cousin in Denver – planning to twist his loved one’s arm to travel at the drop of a hat. But that’s the challenge. Rarely could anyone else do that, even if they gave their word. Only Dad knew how to drop everything and fly. That was his superpower. He had wings. The family member, or colleague, or friend he hoped to take along couldn’t always go.Dad’s lawyer asked one of my uncles: “Do you have any reason to believe that Steven Rothstein made reservations in your name without actually intending to bring you along as his companion?”“Never,” he said.Maybe it seems normal to me because that’s how I was socialized, in the vortex realm of a father who treated an airplane like a bus. As a journalist, now, I can read the court documents and understand where – from American’s standpoint – this behavior was kind of absurd. Yet American Airlines agents condoned it for decades. And understanding that the legal terms of the contract and agreement stipulated that fraud meant giving someone else your pass to use, Dad’s quirky and hectic and allegedly “speculative” behavior seems reasonable within how he worked.There was discovery and depositions throughout 2010 there were seemingly endless motions and American kept extending discovery then a summary judgment in American’s favor on 30 June 2011. They had won.American dismissed “with prejudice” their remaining counterclaims then the case went into a holding pattern after American’s parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy that fall a joint stipulation of dismissal was filed on 21 September 2012, the day before Dad turned 62.But that wasn’t the end end. As mentioned, the judge issued a summary judgment. Then, the court of appeals affirmed. Dad had lost. The appeal stayed until American exited bankruptcy in December 2013. And the final chunks of paperwork were filed in 2014. But it never really quieted.I didn’t know the full details of the trial until I wrote this piece. That my mother, two uncles and an aunt all went in for depositions, or that hundreds of legal hours and thousands of dollars and documents unfolded. I didn’t quite get the magnitude until taking off my daughter hat and trading it in for my journalistic reporter lens.This spring, after gaining access to the court documents, and reading over 80 documents in full, I call Dad as I leave my writing space at 11.30pm and walk to the subway station at Union Square in Manhattan. I say this is clear: what American did to interpret fraud was out of line. But I say: “Dad, some of the bookings they cited for what they called speculative as evidence in the case were … well … shady.”I tell him I need to maintain my journalistic balance and integrity. I ask him point blank: “What’s the deal?”He goes on: “After they told me not to buy an empty seat they knew that I was in a huge depression in the actual MEDICAL SENSE. IT WAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION. I was incoherent, crying several times daily, drinking liquor which I never did before and if I got in a seat I didn’t want to explain why I was crying to anyone.” So he wanted it empty. He wanted to be alone, just as had always been his booking practice on many airlines, even well before the AAirpass days. He liked his space. He liked access to bringing extra carry-on bags. He liked some privacy. The airplane was his home. It’s where he lived. It’s where he got to do work, or catch up on sleep, or regenerate. Then, once Josh died, it’s where he grieved. He was at home.People buy extra and empty seats all the time. Technically, that’s what he’d done with the companion feature. A permanent extra seat for life – whether another human was in it or not.In one sense, I understand how these could be interpreted as “speculative bookings”. Dad does admit he booked seats he wasn’t sure that he, or his companions, would ultimately use. But that’s not an uncommon practice, and he never understood it to be against the rules. His understanding was that fraudulent behavior was limited to giving the AAirpass to someone else – which he never did.“I never booked my own reservation on a computer,” he reminds me. “I never knew how to do this. So every single one of the reservations they didn’t like was booked andor changed by an American employee. Again. I didn’t know how to use a computer. I still have never ever ever booked any reservation online. I always use the phone. So their own agents never stopped me from anything. And I didn’t understand what American was asking me to do or not to do because my mind was torn apart from depression. Real depression.”The 7 April 2018, article in the Hustle by Zachary Crockett quoted my father saying: “I wish I’d never bought the thing.”Earlier this year, I speak to Dad, in India, where he’s traveling for work. He FaceTimes me from his hotel room (from an iPad, still no computer). He sits on a couch, a desk and bright lights trailing in the background.I ask if he’s accepted the loss – the AAirpass.“Probably, yeah,” he says. “Enough’s enough. I can’t worry about it all day long.”Twenty-six minutes and thirty seconds later, after he’s relived 13 December 2008, so I could recount it above, something shifts.“Why did they have to be mean?” he says. And later, he interrupts himself mid-story: “What American did was nasty.”It’s like there isn’t space for anything else in his mouth or head.“It took away my mobility. It took away my hobby. I thought that I could go to Sweden for the weekend in July and pick up flowers when I was 70.”“And now?” I ask.“I can’t do that, can I?”“But how do you feel about it all now?”“I’m angry,” he says. “Still. I’m less angry. But I’m still angry.“They stole my personality,” he continues. “They stole my love. They stole the very thing that caused me to give them a half a million dollars in the first place. And a half a million dollars is probably like 5 million dollars today. And they did it maliciously. If there had been a problem, the proper thing to do would have been to telephone me and tell me they’d like me to change the way I used the AAirpass.”I remind him that when we started talking, now 59 minutes ago, he said he had accepted it all.“I guess as I think about,” he says, “I’m angry. So maybe someplace in between. Or maybe my mind goes back and forth.”Grief and death don’t discriminate. Loss – human life, financial wealth, material goods – doesn’t discriminate either. It’s gut-wrenching no matter what. Of course, racial and class privilege, body ability, access to healthcare and support, and other privileges obviously play a massive role. But the inside spectacle of pain is traumatic across the board.“Your dad was so depressed as it was,” Mom says. “He was totally unglued after Josh died, and then he loses the one thing that gives him some freedom to run away from his grief.”The AAirpass “also wasn’t just a loss for him”, I say to Mom. “It was a loss for our family because it gave us access to experiences that were part of who we had become as a unit, and we’d already lost Josh, and so to have lost the AAirpass meant we could no longer travel.”“… Like we did,” she adds. “Because economically after Josh died, it was also a problem. Dad wasn’t able to work at the same pace, speed and everything else that he had. So it was a huge loss, and it was shitty timing because it gave our family an opportunity to still travel, to find the joy in travel … It took away a big part of our lives, and we already had a big part of our lives taken away … So, it was a family trauma.”We’ve done a remarkable job – at least in my opinion – of finding some way back to being a family unit after Josh died and my parents got orced (which, having separated in the years after Josh died, was formalized in 2014), and Natalie and I have built an unbreakable bond to manage the vacancy lingering between our age gap.I ask Natalie if she has any resentment or anger about the AAirpass.Dad still hasn’t gotten used to it. The AAirpass was “his pass to freedom”, Mom says. “The trauma of taking that away, it grounded him, literally.”“He seems to be, I don’t know, is he running from things?” Ernie adds. “I didn’t think of him as a settled person.” Ernie notes the places my dad has lived – or tried to live – since my parents sold the house and got orced. Berlin. Hong Kong. India. New York. Chicago. Australia. France.“It’s like if he stops moving,” Ernie says, “then he’s not him any more.”We inherit things from our kin. As much as I salivate over locking myself in a silent cave to write, I feel a wildly profound sense of purpose when I’m traveling. As an internationally touring poet, performer and educator, when I am on tour, I am alive. I know how to operate an airport or bus terminal or Amtrak station or rental car. Natalie does too. People have come to me about their hatred or fear of flying. It’s like a spa, I tell them. A certain amount of time in the sky that belongs only to you. Regardless of your seat.Of course, I recognize that because I was socialized to fly in first class, my feelings about travel are biased. Even though I fly economy now, even though my eyes can tell the difference, somehow my body does not. I am in the air. I am free above the world. I don’t need fancy seats or legroom. I’m just grateful to get a break from Earth.My best friend, Chloe, recently asked me what my favorite airline is, given all the travel I do. I said, even though they so deeply impacted my family’s life: American. I feel nostalgia. Loyalty. It’s like having a crush on that kid who chases you around the playground, or never letting go of your first true love.Mom still has skycaps’ numbers in her phone. She, Natalie and I all still fly American, even though it hurts (and I have exactly 384,475 American miles at the time of publishing this piece, so if that dwindles unexpectedly, we’ll all know why).When I talked to Lorraine, she told me she wanted to go to Fargo, North Dakota.I scream: “Lorraine! I’ve never been to North Dakota! Fargo is on my bucket list!” I’ve made it to 47 states by now Oregon and Alaska are still on the list, as well.“Oh my God, Caroline, I’ve got a feeling we may end up going to Fargo, North Dakota,” she says, “laughing our butts off and having a ball.”I am yelping at this point. Literally hitting my leg and chair audibly. Suddenly, I feel like Dad must have felt talking to her – laughing, joking, dreaming up trips. Some people inherit money. Or trauma. A host of other things. I’ve inherited plenty, but perhaps – more than anything – it’s the wanderlust and desire to meet people and go places around the world.After we scheme about Fargo, she sends her love to my mother and sister, and says she’d love Dad’s number she’d love to catch up. I thank her and wish her a beautiful day.“You as well, Caroline,” she says. “I still love ya, so you take care, sweetheart.”“Love you as well,” I say. “And what was it that you would say to my dad?”“And then ‘pay back’?”“He would say, ‘Pay later.’”I ask if we can try again.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

Early on, she told me about a man she had met briefly, years earlier, to whom she felt a sexual attraction unlike anything she had experienced before. Nothing happened, so it stayed an unexplored fantasy.A year ago they met again by chance, and the chemistry was (she explained) instantly electric. We had a frank discussion about her desire for him, which resulted in her taking him to bed one afternoon for what she described as the best orgasm she had ever experienced. This was followed by weekly lunchtime sex (at my apartment in London).Soon afterwards, my partner and I decided to live together, and her lover began to visit our place once or twice a week. The challenge, for me, was to recognise that the chemistry she had with him was no threat to her love for me. I could not ask her to forgo such enjoyment (he is 20 years younger than me, 15 years younger than her, so there is a huge difference in the pleasure she gets from each of us). I recognised that the problem was mine, not hers.We interact comfortably and they feel unselfconscious about showing their mutual attraction in my presence. I enjoy seeing their foreplay or hearing them having noisy sex in the spare room – not as a matter of eroticism, simply two people having a good time.She would not want me to have the same, and so I remain happily monogamous.

You stole my mum away from my dad – at least that’s what I believed at 10 years old. I was wrong, but I wouldn’t learn for a while that someone cannot steal anyone else’s affection they choose to go. I couldn’t hate you, though: you were kind to us you made my mum smile like I’d never seen and you let us have whatever pudding we wanted.You had ended up with three pre-teens you’d never asked for, and over the years we have been difficult. But you took it in your stride. You never once asked us to call you Dad, never asked us to love you. But it was inevitable, you were important. Are important.You didn’t have to deal with us as you did you could have shut the door and said, “Not my problem.” But you didn’t. You opened doors, took your time learning what made each of us happy, what made us angry and what made us giggle like we were five again. We were not your problem but you found the solutions anyway.One of my most vivid memories from childhood is going shopping with you. Without question you let me go into the toy shop. I went to the aisle that had the toy I wanted. It cost an unfathomable amount of money to an 11-year-old. I stared at it and you saw. You said: “What colour do you like?”And then you picked up the red one and handed it to me. I thought I was going to explode. You changed something in me that day. You did something that you probably don’t remember, but to me was so kind and so big, I’ll never forget: you listened.I remember the day my sister was born, technically my half-sister, but none of us see her like that. I was sure that would mean you would stop caring about us but instead that was the day I met my best friend. You gave me the person I love the most, and I will always be in your debt for that.It comes full circle now our sister is the same age I was when I met you.

He regularly holds sold-out sessions for up to 100 people at venues such as the Ministry of Sound in south London.“It’s absolutely exploded,” he says. “I will have taught at 19 festivals this year. I taught at British Summer Time last month and 2,000 people were laying down doing breathing techniques.“It’s becoming a really big thing because it’s so simple. You can feel so good just from breathing.”He claims that people with insomnia have attended just one of his sessions and have slept for six hours that evening.“It’s almost too good to be true,” he concedes. “But I haven’t met one person who has come out of a class and said they don’t get it. I have so many clients who feel ready to taper themselves off anti-anxiety medications in a matter of weeks.”Accelerated deep breathing, also known as holotropic breathwork, has been described as a way to “get high without drugs”, with research finding that the rhythm of breathing modulates neural activity in a network of brain areas involved in smell, memory and emotions.Dr Emma Seppälä, a psychologist who holds positions at Yale and Stanford universities, says studies have found breathing practices can significantly increase well-being while decreasing anxiety and trauma.“Research shows that emotions and breathing are tightly linked, each emotion has a specific pattern of breathing that goes with it,” she says.“By changing your breathing, you can trigger the ‘rest and digest’ parasympathetic nervous system – the opposite of the ‘fight or flight’ response. Your body calms down. As a consequence, you relax and feel better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b78c6c710fd96b8494b8bfcd13bec2c532ee633/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5eef304ec925b68bb09711a10dd1628","title":"blind date bud georgia","story":"What were you hoping for?A night out with someone exciting.First impressions?Very pretty, and a brilliant choice of cocktail.What did you talk about?My weird name, travelling, food, families, the waiters’ uniforms and, obviously, gynaecology.Any awkward moments?Georgia suggested some post-date homework, which was a first.Best thing about Georgia?Her smile and sense of humour.Would you introduce her to your friends?For sure.

I paid almost no attention. I will leave it alone, I thought, and it will leave me alone.Two years later, the alarm remains off, or mostly off the panel in the hall has a yellow light that blinks 24 hours a day. Sometimes when it’s very dark its pulse can be felt through the whole house – a faint reflection glancing off walls, reaching up the stairs. I hardly notice it any more.It is late morning. I am sitting in my office shed when my wife comes to the door.“The alarm is doing something weird,” she says. I am momentarily bewildered.“The alarm?” I say.“Yes,” she says.“You mean the car?” I say.“No, the house,” she says.“Our house?” I say.“Are you doing this on purpose?” she says.I follow her through the kitchen and into the hall. The alarm isn’t going off, but issuing some kind of warning: a loud, two-note chirp that sounds inside the house, not outside. It’s more than annoying there is something accusatory in it.The panel is lit up, with a notification scrolling by – something to do with a numbered error message.“It wants the security code,” I say. “What is the security code?”“I don’t know,” my wife says. “I’ve never known.”“Me, neither,” I say. “Wait.” I take out my keyring, on which hangs a little plastic fob I was given two years ago, bearing the logo of the alarm company. I touch it to the panel and the noise stops.“I’ll invoice you,” I say.This is not the end of the story, but the beginning. The alarm sounds the same warning a week later, and again I silence it with the fob. After that it begins a new cycle, going off every few nights at precisely 4.50am. I trudge down the stairs with my keys and trudge back up again, but I can’t go back to sleep.It takes no more than a week for the alarm to break me. I have trouble getting to sleep in the first place, not knowing if tonight is one of the nights I will be woken at 4.50am. Sometimes the youngest one beats me downstairs, armed with a spare fob he found in a drawer. The first time it happened, I thought he was a burglar. My heart continued to thud for a further hour.“I called the alarm people,” my wife says. “They wanted to charge me £260 just to look at it, so I told them to fuck off.”“Did you?” I say.“No, I was actually very polite,” she says.“Good,” I say, “because I think they might have us over a barrel.” I can find no manual or online remedies, other than the suggestion that I purchase an annual maintenance contract. I begin to suspect the alarm has been remotely programmed to torture me until I give in.“It’s too expensive,” my wife says.“I think the alarm might be the most expensive thing we own,” I say. “Our best hope is that someone breaks in and steals it.”The next day I am in a recording studio, eyes itching, when my wife rings.“So I was coming back from the shops and I saw one of their vans parked in the road,” she says.“Who?” I say.“The alarm company,” she says.“You mean they’re spying on us?”“No,” she says. “I knocked on the guy’s window and gave him 20 quid to come in and look at the box.”“He just happened to be there?” I say. “By coincidence?”“What is wrong with you?” she says. “Anyway, he said there was a fault with one of the sensors, back door or something, and he just turned that bit off. It took five minutes.”“Wow,” I say.“What you mean is…” she says.“What I mean is, well done.”“Correct,” she says.I am reminded, not for the first time, of the extent to which my life is made secure by the vigilance of an actual capable person. That night I sleep soundly and gratefully, until 4.50am, when I am woken by the alarm.

My nine-year-old son is severely autistic and attends a specialist school and, because I don’t have any childcare available as my family work full time, I had to quit my job to become a carer for my son. He has several health-related appointments a week, and with me on my own now, it would have been difficult to find a job, as employers don’t tend to be flexible. My daughter attends a different school and the school run takes me one-and-a-half hours. When my mum retires I’ll look to go back to work, as she’ll be able to take over the appointments.By the time my ex and I split up, I’d accumulated quite a lot of debt: in total it was £30,000. Even though I was earning a lot, I felt that putting it on the credit card was a better option than buying things with cash.I ignored the letters for a while and hoped the situation would go away. I was petrified to answer my door in case bailiffs were standing there. But in March last year I contacted National Debtline for advice, and explained my circumstances, and they gave me some options. As I didn’t own any assets, I felt the best decision was to declare myself bankrupt, which I did in April 2018. I was discharged from bankruptcy in April this year.Being debt-free has felt like a new start. I never slept when I was in debt – I felt worried all the time. I currently receive a carer’s allowance of £264 a month, £720 in tax credits and £390 for housing benefit, all of which comes to a total of £1,374 for the month. Out of that, I pay £550 a month for my rent. My daughter goes to stage school, which is £90 a month, which I pay if I can, or my mum helps us out.I’ve finally learned how to manage money. Rather than set up direct debits, I physically pay or transfer the money, as paying it makes me aware of how much is in my account. I have a diary in the kitchen where I write down what needs to be paid and what date. For example, on a Friday I top up £20 on the gas and electricity. I’m quite strict with my budget now. I give myself a food shopping budget of £50 a week, and only carry that amount with me. Every day I write down how much I’ve spent and then, at the end of the week, I go through it, highlighting what could have been avoided.My friend introduced me to a financial app, Plum, which matches up to your bank account and creates your own savings pot. For example, it looks at your income and outgoings and, based on what you spend, it might take a certain amount out and put it into a separate savings pot. I started it in March this year and I’ve already saved £800. With Christmas coming up, it’s nice to know that in December I don’t have to panic and will have that money to one side.Do I spend any money on me? No, not really – all the money is spent on the kids. I don’t go out or drink or smoke. I don’t ever buy myself clothes – the only new clothes are if my mum buys them for us. As long as the kids are happy and they’ve got plenty to do and keep occupied with, then I’m happy.As told to Suzanne Bearne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d394189c7fab411351afab712909d6f288afe2f/0_166_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69d9024728fab044942646e627195000","title":"theatre seats heres how to bag them at bargain prices","story":"We reveal the tips and tricks that can get you into shows for as little as £10 – or even freeYou would like to go to the theatre more often, but you’re put off by the exorbitant cost. Yes, tickets can be pricey, particularly for the big shows in the West End of London, but you don’t have to pay £75 or £100 (or more) – with a little insider knowledge, you can often get a decent seat for about £10 to £20.And then there are the hush-hush ways you can get free tickets for some shows.Here, we share some of the secrets of how to bag a bargain – or at least not pay massively over the odds.We also shine a spotlight on the seats that regular theatregoers don’t want you to know about: the cheap “restricted view” ones that really aren’t that restricted at all, and the good-value seats that don’t seem to be on many people’s radar. For example, there’s the “royal” box at Hamilton that seats two people in comfort and allows you to practice your regal wave, smug in the knowledge that you have paid far less than most of the punters sitting in the stalls and dress circle. Then there’s the leading theatre that lets you watch its shows for 10p.Meanwhile, there are the schemes that allow people who spread the word about certain shows on Twitter or Facebook to buy tickets at a fraction of the full price.Some of these tips and tricks are courtesy of Steve Rich, the founder of the website Theatremonkey, which features seat reviews and rounds up the latest cheap deals.Top-end prices in the West End have risen by nearly a fifth in the space of a year, according to The Stage’s most recent annual survey, and the best seats at Hamilton and The Phantom of the Opera now cost up to £250 apiece.But in many cases, these premium seats are subsidising much cheaper tickets aimed at bringing in new, younger audiences. In some cases, these cheap tickets are available to all in others, they are restricted to certain groups.For example, with Ian McKellen on Stage, the actor’s one-man show at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London that had its first performance last night and runs until 5 January, top-price seats cost up to £125. But at the same time there are 80 seats for £10 at every show, including some in the stalls.Here are some of the other notable schemes:• Bristol Old Vic’s text message-based “Arts Ping” scheme, for students at the city’s two main universities, lets people nab last-minute seats for as little as £5.• The Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon runs the “RSC Key” scheme offering £5 tickets if you are 16 to 25, plus a £10 “First Time Friday” deal.• With the “PwC £10 Previews” at the Old Vic in London, five weeks before the first preview of a show, the theatre releases at least half the seats for £10 for the first five performances. No age limit.• National Theatre of Scotland’s Futureproof Passport programme allows those aged 14 to 26 to sign up for £5 tickets.• Young+Free at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden, London, offers free tickets by ballot to those aged 16 to 25.• The National Theatre’s Friday Rush where, every Friday at 1pm, £20 tickets for shows in all three theatres at the London complex the following week go on sale. All ages.• Birmingham Rep’s Preview Club for 16- to 30-year-olds, which offers £5 preview tickets.Meanwhile, every week, 40 tickets for each performance of the London production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child the following week are released via TodayTix priced at £40 (£20 per part).Assuming you don’t mind the extra traffic into your inbox (maybe set up an email address specifically for this), you should sign up for as many ticket agency and theatre newsletters and alerts as possible. They often have details of decent discounts and offers. ATG Tickets and Delfont Mackintosh are just two of the biggies.This is where you buy the cheapest tickets in the upper circle or balcony. Rich says: “On a quiet night the theatre will close them, and you will be promoted to the costlier seats downstairs. This works on less popular shows only, of course!”Linked to this, it may be worth opting to pick up your tickets from the box office on the night rather than having them posted, as it is then easier for staff to upgrade you to better seats.Many venues use dynamic pricing, where the cost of a ticket changes according to demand. Sometimes this means prices will drop at the last minute. If you have your eye on a show, check the ticket site(s) a day or two before a performance, and then from around 10am on the day. Sometimes bargains will pop up – unsold day seats, for example, or house seats originally held back for guestsVIPs etc.There are a number of below-the-radar clubs whose job it is to build word-of-mouth buzz and ultimately make sure the actors are not gazing out at rows of empty seats. They do this by discreetly dishing out free or very cheap tickets, often at very short notice (for free tickets there is usually an admin charge). Once you have signed up, you will usually receive regular emails about shows. You will often need to act fast, and invariably you have to keep quiet about how you got your tickets. If you claim a free ticket, it’s highly frowned-upon to then not turn up, and you are encouraged to show your support by maybe buying a drink or a programme.Leading clubs include ShowFilmFirst and My Box Office (the latter charges a £15 annual fee). Unfortunately, at the time of writing, three of the clubs – the Audience Club, Central Tickets and PlaybyPlay UK – were not accepting new applications.Several theatres run “secret seats” schemes. For example, at the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh you can book up to four unreserved tickets for a show, priced at £10 each, and you will find out where you are sitting on the day. The Rose Theatre in Kingston upon Thames runs an almost identical scheme. And the Young Vic in London offers £10 Lucky Dip tickets.Meanwhile, some of the biggest shows run lotteries. Hamilton at the Victoria Palace Theatre has one where you can win the chance to buy up to two tickets for £10 each, while The Book of Mormon at the Prince of Wales theatre has a similar scheme where you pay £20.For example, become a Friend of the Royal Court in London for £35 and you can book best-seats-in-the-house tickets in advance for all its main productions on Monday nights for £12 a time. As one  reader commented, it’s “an utter steal”.With their baffling pricing structures, colour coding and occasional warnings, the seating plans on ticket websites aren’t always easy to navigate.You spot a seat that’s much cheaper than the ones around it, but there must be a reason. When they say “restricted view,” just how restricted is it? How big is that pillar they mention?For the full low-down, check out seat review sites Theatremonkey and SeatPlan. In the meantime, here we identify a few of the seats that those in the know like to keep close to their chests.• The “great value” boxes at Hamilton Most of the stalls and dress circle tickets at the hit musical are £100 to £250 each, and you might have imagined that sitting in your own private box would involve paying top-whack – but you can play at being a royal for £37.50 a seat. There are four “grand circle” two-seater boxes (A, B, C and D) where you pay £37.50 per person, plus two “royal circle” two-seater boxes (B and D) at £57.50 a seat. All come with a warning that these offer a side view and you will miss the side of the set. But many fans rave about them. Here’s what one punter who sat in grand circle box A told Theatremonkey: “Having sat in £100 seats three times, I needed to save money! So at £37.50 per seat, this two-seater ‘box’ gives you lots of space (as chairs are free-standing), privacy, a bit of exclusivity and a great view. So you have to lean over the rail a bit and can’t see a tiny bit of the stage, but you are so close to the stage that it really doesn’t matter… If I had a party of four, I would go for Boxes AB or CD, so all sat together, and for £150 in a totally private space, you will have a wonderful time! The privacy is brilliant! £100 or £200 each for premium seats? Not for me any more!”• Stalls seat N7 at London’s Harold Pinter Theatre This restricted-view seat is often a total bargain. For the current Ian McKellen one-man show run it’s just £10 – even though N6 and N8 are £65. And at many recent performances it was just £15. The catch? This seat comes with the warning “pillar in view, may miss certain moments,” but having sat there myself, it’s not a big problem – lean slightly to the side and you’ll be fine.• The cheap “nests” at London’s Wyndham’s Aka balcony seats A5 and A26. “They are literally miniature padded private ‘nests’”, says Theatremonkey. They are £15 or £20 each for Tom Stoppard’s new play Leopoldstadt, which opens in January.• 10p standing tickets at London’s Royal Court These go on sale one hour before each main house performance. They are apparently “severely restricted view,” but you get to see actors of the calibre of Toby Jones (currently appearing in Glass. Kill. Bluebeard. Imp.) for the price of a couple of cola bottle sweets. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

At last year’s race, The Cliffsofmoher was euthanised on the track after fracturing his shoulder.The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses had run a social media campaign to ask Swift to say #NupToTheCup.“Taylor Swift has put money before compassion by agreeing to perform at the 2019 Melbourne Cup,” the group posted online after the announcement Swift would appear.“Horses are being killed for gambling profits and entertainment. If Taylor Swift cares at all about other animals the way she appears to care about cats, she will cancel her show and make a strong statement that animal abuse is unacceptable.”On Saturday, music booking agency Mushroom Events said the change was due to scheduling issues with Swift’s world tour.“Regrettably, Taylor is no longer able to make it to this year’s Melbourne Cup,” said spokesman Michael Gudinski. “Changes to her Asian promo schedule have made it logistically impossible for her to be here.”Wilson said it was “disappointing for everyone”.Swift had initially been slated to perform two tracks from her new album, Lover, which is Australia’s highest-selling album of the year so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

His daughter Nancy is on the line. She wants to know if he will be free to come and see her awarded a school prize. “I’ll be there, darling,” he assures her. “I’ve almost finished all these hideous interviews.”For the past week, and for the first time in more than three years, Cameron has barely been off the airwaves or out of the media. The hideous interviews have come thick and fast. Some of the headlines they have made have been calculated, like the settling of scores with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over Brexit. Others have been inadvertent, like the revelation that Cameron lobbied for the Queen to “raise an eyebrow” about the Scottish independence campaign during the referendum in 2014.At his launch party on Tuesday, the former prime minister joked that there were two hardback bestsellers being published this month. “One’s a book about a riven society and a dangerous dictatorship,” he told guests. “And the other’s by Margaret Atwood.” His own book, it is clear from our interview, has a wider purpose. Three years after his premiership collapsed in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cameron is trying to regain the right to be heard, above all on Brexit and on the referendum that swept him from office.“I totally understand that there will be some people I will never convince, who will say you should never have had it,” Cameron says of the 2016 vote. He knows that millions of remain voters blame him viscerally for everything that has happened since then and probably always will. “But I think there are a lot of people who can also see that there was a growing inevitability about having a referendum and, yes, there was a problem in the Tory party, but the relationship with the EU was a far bigger one. Britain’s position was becoming more tenuous, and we had to fix it. I hope that I can convince people that it was an honest and thought through attempt to deal with the issue.”This is the nub of the case that weaves its way right through the 700 pages of Cameron’s memoir and through much of what he has said in interviews this week. The UK’s relationship with the EU was always both necessary and contingent, he argues. Until now, every prime minister for the last 40 years has simultaneously wanted a seat at the top table and a special deal for Britain. Every one of them, even Tony Blair, felt they had to fight off moves to political union. “These weren’t pretend ghouls and ghosts,” Cameron says. “They were real.” It’s a useful reminder that Cameron, so often dismissed as an insouciant optimist, is at heart a very practical politician.He is insistent that British ambivalence has origins that long predate the migration crisis or the rise of Nigel Farage. Cameron traces the roots back to Margaret Thatcher’s support for the EU single market in the 1980s. “The single market was both the best thing and the worst thing for Conservatives. We created it. But then we didn’t like the legislation that was needed to make it work.”“The EU is a law-based organisation that doesn’t like exceptions,” he continues. “The differing speeds issue had to be addressed, especially with the eurozone.” Cameron thinks the balancing act would have had to continue even if remain had won in 2016. He quotes the downbeat assessment of an anonymous official (surely the Bank of England deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe) telling him “it would have kept us in the EU for another 10 years”.“My biggest regret”, he says, is that he let expectations about his 2015-16 renegotiation get too high. “I should have made it clear that some of the things my colleagues were arguing for were not available – picking and choosing which laws to obey, radical cuts in the budget, some sort of country club membership. These things are not possible.” He thinks there was more substance to the renegotiation deal he brought back from Brussels in February 2016 than is now acknowledged. The concessions he achieved were “a big deal for the EU. They hated it.”Some of that defiant confidence drains away when Cameron talks about the referendum process itself. He thought “a lot” about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. “I agonise about that one.” He thought the Electoral Commission “got it wrong” by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. “We lost the vote so it’s worth asking the question.” He is scathing about Labour’s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. “They were awol.”Cameron’s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. “I’m a remainer,” he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold – and now unravel – since he walked away in July 2016.He says supportive things about Theresa May. “She was definitely a moderniser.” But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that “she got a deal”. He “shares her frustration” that it was then voted down by “the people who most wanted Brexit”. But, crucially, he says that “picking one of the existing models, a Norway-style model, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.”And he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. “If you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.”And, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron’s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. “I think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum.

Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20190919-69059-20190920_TIFDCAm.mp3 Cameron’s memoir ranges wide across many issues. He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition’s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that “some of the early speeches were a bit ‘Hello birds. Hello trees.’” he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into “a modern compassionate Conservative party”. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears.In the end, though, everything in Cameron’s story always comes back to Brexit. “It is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it’s so massive,” he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. “It wasn’t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing. But I was wrestling with a genuine problem. The trouble was I lost.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5f8dfcb0ab82e511e7d6c6167c567b99a432b63/0_109_6720_4031/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce56a9fd999b4002d12933b6d7bc1f00","title":"thornberry labour could back tory brexit deal in exchange for referendum","story":"Shadow foreign secretary says party should not remain neutral in any second voteLabour should consider voting for a Boris Johnson Brexit deal in exchange for the promise of a referendum, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has told the .As anti-Brexit activists prepare to make their voices heard at Labour’s conference in Brighton this weekend, Thornberry suggested her party could allow a deal to pass through parliament – if they could thereby secure a “people’s vote”.“I think it’s something we would have to consider. We would have to consider it seriously. We would,” Thornberry said.And the Islington South MP struck a markedly different tone to Jeremy Corbyn when she warned the Labour leader that it “wouldn’t be right” for the party to remain neutral in a second Brexit referendum.Speaking after an article by Corbyn in the  appeared to suggest that the Labour leader would not campaign on either side in a new vote, the shadow foreign secretary said: “It’s a really, really big decision that the country has to make.“I think it wouldn’t be right for Labour to have no opinion on such a big decision. I just don’t think it is.”Writing in the  earlier this week, Corbyn said a Labour government would seek a “sensible” Brexit deal, and then “put that to a public vote alongside remain”, adding: “I will pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.”But Thornberry, who will speak at a People’s Vote rally in Brighton on Saturday, said that Labour should make clear at the outset, and before any general election, that it would recommend that voters supported remaining in the EU.“I think we should have three parts to our policy: we have a referendum, remain’s on the ballot paper and Labour should campaign for remain,” she said.Late on Friday John McDonnell poured cold water on the suggestion that Labour could back a Johnson deal in return for a referendum, saying he did not believe the prime minister would come back with anything the party could seriously consider getting behind.“Everyone is saying let’s see what comes back. All the Tory media seem to be interested in is the Irish backstop, but there’s a whole range of other stuff we wouldn’t touch with a bargepole,” the shadow chancellor told the Daily Mirror.Thornberry’s intervention came as senior Corbyn loyalists try to head off a confrontation over Brexit in Brighton.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who was among those encouraging the Labour leader to embrace the idea of a referendum earlier this year, said his current position was now one all party members should be able to support.“I do think there is an element, in Westminster, of people pursuing a remain argument because they want to undermine Jeremy,” she said. “And the thing is, whatever Jeremy does is not enough.“At one point they were all saying, ‘Jeremy’s got to come out for a people’s vote.’ Well Jeremy’s come out for a people’s vote. He’s saying – and he’s very clear on this – it’s got to go back to the people. But all these people who were calling for a people’s vote, they’re not saying, ‘Oh that’s good.’ They’ve got some other impossibilist demand.”She urged activists to focus instead on other issues in Brighton, including tackling the climate crisis and liberalising immigration policy, which she believes is more of a motivating factor for many younger voters than Brexit.Labour’s Brexit policy has shifted significantly in a series of stages since last year’s party conference passed a motion saying a referendum must be among the options “on the table”.More than 90 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions this year, with the majority demanding a remain position.Their views will be hammered out into one or more “composite motions”, to be debated on Monday, and the party’s national executive committee (NEC) could also table its own Brexit policy statement.Some anti-Brexit Labour activists are wary of sparking a direct conflict with the party leadership. But Thornberry warned that unless it took a clear stance, Labour risked losing voters on both sides of the Brexit ide.She added: “I think that a lot of the leave voters are already extremely ambivalent about the Labour party. What we don’t want to do is lose people on both sides.“It is like, if you walk in the middle of the road and a car’s coming towards you, you have to decide which side you’re going to jump.”Thornberry is backed by remain-supporting shadow cabinet members, including Tom Watson, in entertaining the idea of supporting a Johnson deal on condition it is put to the public.A similar plan was proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson as Theresa May tried to win MPs’ backing for her Brexit deal – and its proponents believe they could potentially win a majority, with the support of the 21 former Conservatives expelled by Johnson.Watson said: “Emily is right to try to find an understanding with others that allows the people to decide on whether a government deal is credible. We should all be looking for solutions to end years of parliamentary deadlock.”However, other shadow cabinet members remain deeply sceptical. Abbott said: “I don’t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it’s got a referendum attached. That’s why I was against Kyle-Wilson.“Either it’s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market – or it’s not. The referendum is not an end in itself.”“Kyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don’t support it,” she added.Unlike Thornberry, Abbott also believes it would be legitimate for Corbyn to take a back seat during a future referendum.“If Jeremy is going to be a prime minister for the whole country, it is difficult for him to take a position which is contrary to 17 million voters,” she said.Thornberry was scathing about Johnson, whom she shadowed during his time as foreign secretary – the one cabinet role he held before becoming prime minister in July.“He doesn’t have any grasp of detail so the way to beat him was to be a girly swot,” she said, pointedly using the same phrase Johnson applied to his predecessor David Cameron, in a leaked memo.She said such language, together with Johnson’s taunting of Corbyn as a “big girl’s blouse”, was indicative of the prime minister’s attitude to women.“I think it’s deeply ingrained, the way that he talks about women. I think he has a contempt for women,” she said.She believes Johnson’s tough-guy rhetoric, including comparing himself to the Incredible Hulk, will not endear him to female voters.“I think they see him as a buffoon and somebody who doesn’t understand people, but also doesn’t care about the things that lots of women care about,” she said.“I just don’t think women want to be governed by the Hulk. They don’t.”And she argued that Johnson – with the aid of his key adviser, Dominic Cummings – was deliberately styling himself as a political “strongman” in the mould of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.“We have all these strong men in politics – whether it’s Brazil, or the Philippines, or Trump, or Putin. They’re all big men: it’s let’s look up to them, don’t be afraid, they’re looking after things. It’s so fundamentally anti-democratic. And Boris seems to be modelling himself on that.”In his Mirror interview, McDonnell also said that should Labour succeed in defeating Johnson in an election but fail to win a parliamentary majority it would not enter a coalition.“We’ll not do it with any of them,” he said. “We’ll go in, we’ll get a majority government, if we don’t get a majority government we’ll go in as a minority party government. We’ll implement the manifesto. If any of those minor parties refuse to support us we’ll go back to the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident. Scotland are hard to predict. Wales have high hopes. And Uruguay just want to win a gameWe hope to win it, but is that realistic? We will be competitive and we will trouble top teams, may even upset one if it all comes magically together. We have a decent draw if we can beat Wales. If we top our pool, we play France or Argentina in the quarter-finals and will be too strong for them. That gives us a semi-final, most probably against South Africa or New Zealand, maybe Ireland, at which time our tournament will end. If we are very lucky and face Ireland – who are a much more settled team but have shown some weaknesses recently – we might make a final. But I very much doubt it.We have a decent pack and lineout, but our No 6 is not a No 6. Michael Cheika will unbalance the pack and play the Michael Hooper and David Pockock combo, which does not work. Our bench players does not give us depth. We have brought an out-of-form and ageing Ashley Cooper instead of some of our best performers. One full-back can’t catch high balls and the other has no pace. At least one winger has no pace. And, crucially for a World Cup, we don’t have a consistent goal kicker. Still ... we can come together once in a while. Aiden Smith•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterThe “glory days” of the 1990s, when Canada could be competitive against all but the very big boys, are long gone and there is a widespread acceptance that the standard of rugby here has slipped and with it a huge opportunity has gone. Couple that with being placed in a “pool of death” and expectations among Canadian rugby fans are very low. The Namibia game represents our final. If we win that and put up a creditable performance against Italy, most fans will be satisfied. Tim YobiloEngland are not favourites but we are one of the main contenders. This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approaching the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

On both occasions he was still in the championship fight with Lewis Hamilton. Both times Hamilton took the win. This year the odds weigh even more heavily against the German but, given his poor performances of late, an error-free run may be the fillip he needs. Vettel says he still loves the sport but sorely needs to find his touch if Sunday afternoons are not to become more chore than passion.Four times a winner under the floodlights of the Marina Bay circuit – a stern physical and mental test of 23 corners in heat and high humidity, beneath walls that punish any mistakes – Vettel relishes this challenge. The task has not changed but this year carries even more pressure and Vettel conceded in Singapore this is not a track that is forgiving of a driver perhaps pushing too hard.Hamilton is already within touching distance of the title, 63 points clear of his Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas. He won two years ago after Vettel went out in a crash at turn one as Max Verstappen looked to charge past him. Last year Hamilton put in a sublime qualifying lap to take pole and from it dominate the race. Then Ferrari had the better car at this track this time their weakness through slow corners puts them on the back foot.It is a disadvantage that is hitting Vettel harder than his teammate Charles Leclerc, who has won the last two races. At the last round at Monza, Vettel made an unforced error in spinning at the Ascari chicane, an ignominious mistake and not the first. Notably this season he also spun in Bahrain, crashed in practice at Monaco, went off track in Canada costing him a win and made a serious misjudgment in hitting Verstappen at Silverstone.It appears he is uncomfortable with the balance of the Ferrari and as yet the team have not found a way to adjust it to his liking. This, as suggested by the former driver Juan Pablo Montoya this week, is a technical issue for Vettel who is having to push himself harder and adapt his style. Pointedly he noted in Singapore his fundamental lack of confidence in the feel of the Ferrari beneath him.“I don’t think it is mental, I am doing the right things,” Vettel said. “It is crucial not to overcomplicate things too much and pull through it. Yes, here and there I might not have the absolute trust in the car and the best feeling but it is improving.”Marina Bay is a circuit where trust in the car is vital and where Vettel believes and Hamilton proved last year, a driver can make the difference. Ferrari have brought a new nose to Singapore looking for more grip through the plethora of 90-degree corners, where all the teams are using their maximum downforce packages.Under scrutiny and under pressure, Vettel remained hopeful of making progress but knows he needs a clean sheet on Sunday. “It is a question of details, lining them up,” he said. “I am convinced that sooner or later it will click and things will fall into place. There are always things you can do better. I can learn.”Hamilton, though, was looking ominously strong again on track. Unsurprisingly Red Bull, very strong on high aero circuits, performed well at Marina Bay, with Verstappen quickest in first practice. However, in the more representative second session run at night, Hamilton was just under two-tenths clear of the Dutchman, with Vettel in third. Almost certainly a one-stop race with overtaking difficult, pole will be vital and Hamilton looks to have the pace on his rivals to take it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a474adb14465e773fcc63cd9567cd1d546aaf40/6_0_4314_2589/master/4314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f199909582abd7172ab7fe7da37c085c","title":"wigan salford super league match report","story":"This was about everything the game has come to expect from the reigning Super League champions, Wigan.

And if the Warriors and Salford meet again in the Grand Final, with the stakes even higher, it will be simply unmissable.With a game as tight as this, any one of a number of key moments could be pinned as game-changing but the error from Krisnan Inu – a needless offload near his own line which allowed Tommy Leuluai to put Wigan 12-6 ahead – was perhaps the biggest. “Hopefully we learn from that for next week,” Salford’s coach, Ian Watson, said.Prior to that the two sides could not be split, with tries from Oliver Gildart and George Griffin making it 6-6 at half-time. Inu’s error came moments after Ken Sio came desperately close to putting Salford ahead for the first time. He was edged into touch, allowing Wigan off the hook and, from there, they kicked into play-off mode.“We’re ready for the challenge at St Helens,” Adrian Lam, Wigan’s coach, said. “We knew it would come down to the wire, but we’re ready for this.” Leuluai’s try was swiftly followed by Williams’ long-range effort and, with Zak Hardaker converting both to make it 18-6, the Warriors looked set to rack up a big scoreline.But Salford are made of sterner stuff than that. Jackson Hastings’ wonderful solo try on the hour mark halved the deficit and, though they battled valiantly until the final whistle, Wigan’s magnificent last-ditch defending ensured it would be they, not the Red Devils, who take on the league leaders next week for a place at Old Trafford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7ffbb53879f08a81a766c0c6c4e46c31f26685/98_239_3491_2094/master/3491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a784554422947f1d0f94f3c16d69092","title":"australia grind out untidy win over fiji in their rugby world cup opener","story":"Australia survived a considerable scare to clinch victory in their opening World Cup match against Fiji, who were left with a sense of injustice in defeat. Two second-half tries for the Wallabies hooker Tolu Latu swung the match in their favour before a late flourish, but Fiji can feel aggrieved at Reece Hodge’s high tackle on Peceli Yato that went unpunished and forced their star flanker off during the first half.Hodge was sweeping round to tackle Yato, who was charging towards the try-line after Australia had been caught napping by a quick Fiji lineout. Hodge’s tackle was high with minimal use of the arms and appeared to make contact with Yato’s head. It could well have been a penalty try and certainly a card of either colour but it went unpunished, the referee Ben O’Keeffe opting against consulting the TMO.Yato would play no further part after a breathtaking opening 25 minutes in which he inspired Fiji into an 11-8 lead. Hodge, for his part, scored Australia’s next try.It must be said that Australia’s quality shone through in the final quarter, their set-piece – both the scrum and the driving maul – was significantly superior, and there is no guarantee that the result would have been any different had Yato stayed on the pitch and Hodge been sanctioned. They must also be given huge credit for rallying from 21-12 down in the second half, their biggest ever World Cup turnaround.At the same time there was an unmistakable sour taste in the mouth given World Rugby’s insistence that tackles to the head will be clamped down upon. Ross Tucker, the sports scientist who played a part in developing World Rugby’s decision-making framework for high tackles was among many observes who took to social media to declare Hodge ought to have been sent off.All in all, it is simply a great shame that Yato was not able to continue. He emerged from the tunnel but it was clear he was not coming back on when he lay down, flat on his back, evidently distraught by the side of the pitch. Fiji led by two points at the time but it was hard not consider that the contest’s telling moment. Put simply, Yato is that influential to this side. He would be for any side in the competition.Fiji’s fast start was entirely expected, no doubt by Australia, but there was little the Wallabies could do about it. There were tears during the Fiji anthem, they then tore Australia asunder. Semi Radradra on the left wing set the tone, the former Parramatta Eels star thundering into Hodge inside the opening couple of minutes. It is often lamented that Fiji lack the control at halfback to win contests such as these but Ben Volavola began as if determined to prove that wrong and he opened the scoring with an early penalty.Before the first 10 minutes were up, Fiji were 8-0 to the good with Yato finishing off a glorious move down the right-hand. Fiji worked the ball from left to right inside their own half and freed Josiua Tuisova, who in turn found Nayacalevu. He had the omnipresent Yato on his shoulder, who streaked clear. At this stage Australia were shellshocked. Botia was next with a thunderous hit while Yato carved through the Wallabies defence through the middle.It was no surprise to see Hooper leading the response, getting Australia on the board with a powerful score from close range but Volavala’s accurate boot kept Fiji in the ascendancy. He continued to do so both before and after Yato made way, enough to give Fiji a half-time lead despite Hodge’s well-worked try in the right-hand corner.Fiji were given renewed hope when their outside-centre Waisea Nayacalevu pounced on a loose ball five minutes into the second half and raced under the posts to give Fiji a nine-point lead but ultimately Australia gathered themselves and ground out a lead.Hodge kicked Australia back to within six points after Michael Hooper’s bust up the middle and in between Latu’s two tries form close-range driving mauls, Levani Botia was sent to the sin-bin with Fiji’s discipline rapidly deteriorating, the game effectively up. Samu Kerevi and Marika Koroibete - both of whom were born in Fiji - added late tries for good measure but the bonus-point victory will likely be greeted more with relief than any great celebrations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ee0f28533f0c219108e0e0ffeb4fded7b601b74/0_70_3296_1979/master/3296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a87ae825b42a40f8bb0f98109497913","title":"australia v fiji rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"So, it’s one from one in Pool D for Australia, as they start their ninth World Cup campaign in the manner they’ve started eight previously, with a win.For nearly 50 minutes they were absolutely in a battle here - Fiji were expected to be fearsome with ball in hand, but especially in the first half the Pasifika nation also looked well-organised, disciplined and solid at the set piece. They led at the break, and even jumped to a nine-point lead early in the second half, but whether fitness or depth played a part, it was Australia that finished by far the stronger side.A change of tactics - a reversion to a simpler form of rugby, built on clever kicking and solid metres up the centre - probably played a part in the significant shift of momentum. Fiji saw a man dismissed for repeated infringements and the Wallabies were ruthless in prosecuting their advantage. A bruising encounter first up - plenty to come from this group with Wales, Georgia and Uruguay still to come!A tweet in from Michael:What do you think, folks back home?There was certainly a huge momentum change about 60 minutes into that one - but were Fiji starting to fade before the yellow card for repeated infringements?Australia were good in the scrum, solid in the lineout and started to get on top with the driving mauls. We’ll wait to see what coach John McKee makes of it all the post-game presser, I guess.So! A first look at Pool D action. Your thoughts on that opening clash?Michael Hooper looks a relieved man after the match. “Are you happy with that one?” “Absolutely!”And can you blame him. 18 points the difference at the end - you’d be hard pressed to find someone who would tell you that that was an eighteen point match, though. And after a bonus five minutes (that might have felt an eternity for aching limbs) its Pocock who gets his hands on the pill and boots it into touch!That’s the game, that’s the win for Australia. They’ve come through a tough first-up examination - and just got over the line.80 min: And there’s that gong again (love it). Fiji earn the penalty and they look to play on - can they salvage a late consolation try?It’s a Fijian lineout 5m out and they go short. There’s another advantage for collapsing the maul, and we play an extra few minutes. I don’t think guys like Pocock fancy this - it’s been a long hard road back from injury for some.They go short with another line out, and it’s a knock on as Slipper es for the intercept but can’t hold it. We play on.79 min: Australia get isolated and Fiji win the turnover. One last chance for Fiji to show their backline pace. There’s a knock on though, and the chance is lost. Some big tired bodies out there.77 min: Over 40,000 fans in tonight in Sapporo, and they’ve seen some decent rugby tonight - even if the neutral might have wanted to see it finish a little closer.75 min: it’s Australia, once again on the attack.It’s a tough scoreline this - if you wandered in you’d think it was a comfortable margin for the Wallabies, but for 60 or so minutes it was anything but. Fiji have grounds to be aggrieved - they’ve been so good for so long, but it’s those championship minutes that have come to haunt them.73 min: Good work from Dane Haylett-Petty, fresh off the bench, to make space out wide for the flyer, Koroibete - and the former Melbourne Storm man scores in the corner!Toomua with the attempt from near the touchline - and the legs are warm now, and he slots it!71 min: A close up of a frustrated John McKee in the Fijian coaching box. He came so close to engineering a stunning first-up result here today, but perhaps that reaction tells you that he knows his side have finally let this one slip.68 min: They’re besieging the Fijian line here - Australia, but so far the defence has been okay around the ball.They swing it wide for a change, and the man advantage pays idend. It’s the outside centre who crashes over - and surely, that’s the resistance broken.Toomua slots that one, and he adds the two extra points.66 min: Jordan Uelese with the lineout feed as Latu leaves the pitch the first hooker to have ever scored a World Cup double. But he misses the jumper! Let off for Fiji.They clear their lines, but not huge metres. Australia come again, but it’s a terrific steal from the fullback Murimurivalu with the Wallabies threatening once again!64 min: So, after just over an hour - finally the Wallabies hit the front. Can they take advantage of the one-man advantage?Another penalty to Australia, they’ve got all the momentum, the 2015 World Cup finalists.61 min: Yellow card! They had the warning - as Australia were on the attack once again it was another penalty against Fiji, and it’s the inside centre Levani Botia who’s sent to the sin bin.It’s almost a carbon copy play from Australia - they get the push moving, Fiji try to defend but they spin it left this time, and it’s a rare try double for the hooker, Latu!A third different kicker for the Wallabies, as Matt Toomua - freshly on for Leali’ifano - who tries his hand (or foot). But it just slides to the left! Important misses, these. Will it prove costly?60 min: So - they’ve led for almost an hour, Fiji - but now the pressure is building. Can they hang on for this final 20? Both sides will begin to shuffle their packs - do they have the depth from the bench?57 min: There was no collapsing that maul - it was a decent initial counterpush from Fiji, put Pocock and Sio spin off the side and it’s the front-rower Latu who ends up over the line!A strong forward pack move from Australia, and they finally get their reward!It’s gettable from Hodge - but he thumps the conversion attempt to the right. Two points left on the field?56 min: Australia try the cross-field kick - but the fullback Murimurivalu cleans up. A talk to the Fijian captain as we come back for another advantage penalty - it’s another case of collapsing the maul: next incident gets a yellow card is the word from the whistle-man, Ben O’Keefe.55 min: Australia look to spread wide, but there’s a penalty against Fiji for collapsing the maul beforehand so we come back for the advantage. The Wallabies have a conference but decided to kick for touch. It worked last time - will they get the extra points this time?53 min: Genia with a kick to the corner - and the 100+ cap half rolls on lovely ball into touch. Fiji lineout feed, which they win - but they’ve knocked on!Big opportunity for Australia to push from a 5m lineout.50 min: It’s a change of kickers with Leali’ifano perhaps carrying a slight leg knock, and Hodge smashes it over the black dot. An important three points for Australia to bring it back inside a converted try.And Cheika’s seen enough - it’s White off and Genia on for an early change in the halves.48 min: It’s a burst from Hooper! He’s leading from the front, and that’s great metres off the pop-pass from Leali’ifano. They’re about 10m out, Australia - but it’s been turned over! The fullback gets it one-on-one from Latu, great strength, Murimurivalu. They kick to clear their line, Fiji.For all the talk of their lethal backs, their forward pack has been pretty solid today, as well, Fiji.Oh my, oh my. It’s ball to ground in a pretty routine backline play - maybe some pressure from Fiji causing nerves in that area. And it’s the big centre - Nayacalevu - who recovers and sprints away through the middle! Nobody can catch him, it’s about a 60m dash. They were on the attack Australia, and they’ve coughed it up. How costly!Volavola with the conversion from dead in front. A game-high 9pt lead for Fiji!43 min: And now a penalty to the Wallabies as White is cleaned out illegally. Pocock with the turnover, he’s started the half brightly. Great metres from Hodge with the kick for touch - they gain 40m or so.41 min: It’s pinched by Pocock - but he’s been pinged by the Kiwi referee for not supporting his bodyweight in the steal. A tight one - he doesn’t often get those wrong, the world’s best pilferer.And we’re back, and it’s Australia who start with ball in hand. White with the kick-clearance from inside the 22. Fijian lineout just inside the Wallabies’ half.Tweet in from Ben: It’s a good point, Ben. There’s been a fair bit on investment from world rugby into some of the so-called “tier two” nations in recent years - $60m and the investment behind a “scrum factory” to help develop forward play.A good yarn on this topic from last week - here’s Ben Ryan on the topic for your half-time reading: So! A chance to catch breath. Your thoughts on that first half?Fiji looking so dangerous one-on-one and out wide, as you’d suspect. Australia enjoying a little bit of superiority at the scrum and up through the middle. At 24min that big last man tackle from Hodge on Yato looked an awful lot like a shoulder to the head!Should he even be on the field right now?It’s an interesting question, Ceri - at first look I did wonder if he got the arms wrapped, the Australian winger, as he came across at pace. It was a big collision and it’s a shame to see that Yato hasn’t returned to the action. A fair talking point.And Volavola looks for touch - and that’s the first half! Both sides head to the sheds to the applause of an appreciative crowd in Sapporo. What a half of rugby from Fiji: they go in ahead, can they repeat the dose after the break?39 min: Another injury break as the big front rower Campese Ma’afu receives some attention ahead of the scrum. He seems okay, thankfully.There’s the gong for half-time. Love it - very Iron Chef. We set for a scrum though.37 min: Rodda with the receive deep after Fiji restart. Australia look to spread again, but Koroibete almost runs out of real estate. Good run from O’Connor who skips through one or two would-be tacklers. Kerevi tries to pump the legs, 10 phases from the Wallabies. But it’s a knock on from White. Ach, a let off.34 min: Hooper elects to go for touch! Big call from the captain - they’ll need points here to justify this.Australia win the lineout, they set for the big push. Nakarawa almost turns it over, but the Wallabies retain. They’re about 10m out - they swing to the edge.. and it’s Hodge in the corner!Leali’ifano from the touchline with the conversion attempt to level it - but he hooks it across the face.32 min: Penalty against the Fijians this time. Australia kick to touch and Latu looks to feed in. Arnold rises and wins well. Gee, they’re up quick on Leali’ifano once again - he’s having a torrid start to this one. We go back for a high tackle. Do they take the shot, Australia? It’s about 40m out.A tricky one from Volavola but he just creeps it over. A good strike and an important three points - takes it out to a converted try lead.Some frustration creeping in for the Wallabies - you can hear players questioning the refereeing team on certain occasions.A tweet in from Andy:It’s a terrific question. The Wallabies going wide early on on several occasions, and not getting any rewards from it. Maybe nerves? Peer pressure?28 min: Good attacking momentum here, but they’ve spilled in contact again, just 10m from the line, Fiji! Credit the defence, I guess, but a couple of loose carries letting themselves down. Samu Kerevi with a clearing kick - but we come back for a suspected high shot from Izack Rodda.27 min: They go left Fiji, but it’s good defence from Hodge once again and Botia spills the ball in the contact! Australia kick to clear their line but doesn’t get much distance on it. Fijian lineout about 20m out.26 min: Some concussion concern for Yato - that’s a shame, what a start he’s had. But he’s replaced for a suspected head knock.What can they muster from the scrum, Fiji. We know how good their backs are - let’s see what their forwards can come up with.24 min: Fiji with a lineout feed and it’s Yato bursting through - what a game he’s having, he’s broken the Australian line on at least three occasions already. Big last man tackle from Hodge - he may have saved a try there. And then it’s Kerevi who picks up a spilled ball, but he’s caught in his own in-goal area, and it’s Fiji with an attacking scrum!They take the shot at goal from deep, and it just stays on line from Volavola. It really is an unusual kicking style - not Dan Biggar or Johnny Wilkinson prep-wise, just odd. I dunno - see if it’s on Youtube somewhere. It gets the job done, though, and that’s the main thing.Advantage Australia as a Fijian player gets offside and prevents the distribution from White. They kick to touch and look to feed a lineout from just inside the Fijian half, but it’s a terrific hit on Leali’ifano and they cough up possession, Australia!Are they targeting the Wallabies’ No 10, or is he just unlucky early on? this time it’s Botia who collects the fly half.17 min: Wallabies with a big push from the scrum - good opportunity here, they’re just 10m out. They look to pick and carry, and there’s a man in gold that’s bustled over - it’s the skipper! He’s got through about three there from 5m out - plenty to do, but he stayed low and got there.Leali’ifano converts from just off to the side.15 min: Leali’ifano sparks a move, but he’s clattered and remains down as Australia look to spread wide. This is better from the Wallabies, but the force the last pass and it’s turned over.They win the scrum feed after a small Fijian knock on. Leali’ifano gets back to his feet, a little gingerly.13 min: Relieving penalty for Australia from the scrum - they need to win some little battles, the Wallabies - it’s been the Pasifika nation that’s on the front foot over the first 10 or so minutes.11 min: Penalty against Australia, as Koroibete gets isolated - the attack peters out. Fiji kick to touch and look to launch from a five-man lineout.It’s a long feed, and they’re straight on the attack, the Fijians. They look for Radradra with the crossfield kick and he rises above Hodge - but can’t quite hold the regather! Nearly a second try!10 min: Welly, well. If they didn’t realise they were at the World Cup, the Wallabies - they do now. Ten of the fifteen in gold making their cup debuts today. You’d imagine some settling words from Hooper.7 min: Lovely bust! It’s Tuisova with a huge bump down the wing - his opposite number brushed aside with consummate ease, and then with hardly any territory to work with they burst down the wing - Yato, backs up on the inside and scores in the corner!Volavola just hooks to the left with the conversion attempt. 6 min: Australia do well to regather from the short kick off, but they look to push wide and it’s into touch as Beale fails to find his man on the wing. Fijian lineout.First blood! Out to the left of the posts but it’s right over the black dot from Ben Volavola. A curious kicking style, but he gets it done.3 min: A well-weighted kick to the corner by Fiji - and it will be an Australian lineout just 5m out from their own line.They win it, the men in gold - but Nakarawa isolates Nic White, and they’ve conceded an early penalty, the Wallabies!2 min: First look of Australia with the ball, but O’Connor is turned over after a strong one-on-one tackle from Tuisova.A nervous moment for the Fijian winger a little later as Koroibete puts a kick in that he juggles, but it goes backwards.1 min: It’s the Wallabies who get us underway, and they kick deep. And there’s a charge down! Dramatic start - Fiji recover the ball, just metres from their own line.We’ve seen the Fijians rugby sevens gather with a song of praise - but it’s the pre-game war dance for the 15s team. It’s well received by the crowd, and the Australian team.A conflicted role for former Australian U20s assistant coach John McKee - Fiji’s coach. But he’s a professional, you’d imagine. Three Fijian-born players in the Wallabies XV - Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete and Isi Naisarani. So emotions all round, you’d think.Our players have had their dressing room huddles - and they’ve just left the tunnel to a tremendous reception. What a crowd, what a stadium this looks!And now it’s time for the anthems, Fiji first, then Australia.So without further ado - some team news: It feels an age since both David Pocock and Michael Hooper both started in gold for Australia, while for NRL fans, there’s a pretty familiar name starting in the centres for Fiji.As I noted in the preview, Australia have won the previous 11 clashes against Fiji - but with the last of those coming over two years ago it’s uncertain how little of that history will matter today.They’ve won their opening pool game on 7 of 8 occasions, Australia (spot quiz: can you remember the one they didn’t?) - so it may very much depend upon whether Michael Cheika has got his troops in the right headspace. With the most experienced group at the entire WC (average caps  player) you’d imagine Australia won’t get “caught cold” - but stranger things have happened.Fiji for their part come in on a three-game winning streak and their highest ever world ranking, so will be no pushovers.Afternoonmorningevening all! From me to you, from wherever you’re following our coverage today. I’m not sure about you, but I have genuine butterflies in the stomach - not for any partisan reasons, but simply because it’s the World Cup! The pinnacle of any sport’s quadrennial calendar - the event that fuels the dreams that get players through every dreary morning training or gruelling injury recovery sessions.Australia v Fiji. No walk in the park for the Wallabies and what a test for the Pasifika nation. Ranked in the top ten - above nations such as Argentina that have troubled Australia.Your thoughts on this contest? Fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation here - this is a train that picks up all passengers.With a flurry of pomp and pageantry the Rugby World Cup is officially underway - and in pretty positive fashion for the home nation after their opening night triumph.For Australian and Fijian fans all eyes turn to game two - which outside of the massive NZ v South Africa blockbuster later today is surely one of the picks of the opening rounds.In theory, Australia should be strong favourites to win. That’s certainly been the case the last eleven times these two nations have met, including twice previously at World Cup level.And yet. With Fiji one of the so-called “tier two” nations that’s very much on the rise, packed with explosive inidual talent, there’s a lurking suspicion the powerhouses at rugby sevens level might just be ready to step up and make a huge statement in the 15-a-side game.It’s a clash that has “banana skin” written all over it - especially for a Wallabies side coming off hugely indifferent form over the past 18 months, despite the recent win over New Zealand.Whatever happens, it’s likely to be fast, furious, and above all, hugely entertaining - so strap in and enjoy the ride!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5afda91a0eb80517784c7cbd85b0142c849339d1/0_148_3332_1999/master/3332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e372669af657e34e3c84fe742e3e7ae","title":"france v argentina rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"28 min: A set play now from the French - it’s Penaud again making the metres. But, ach. It’s a dropped ball. Once again they do the hard stuff, but duff the simple stuff, the French. Six carries from Penaud already, six defenders beaten. Magical.27 min: Referee Angus Gardner has been prominent early on. He’s not happy with this scrum - and talks to both teams to improve their bind. It’s another scrum penalty against the French, who go slightly too early.25 min: A spontaneous rendition of La Marseillaise rings around this fine stadium in Tokyo.Not just the anthem game these teams are winning...they’re also winning the best kit competition...For those at home - it’s two classic strips from both France and Argentina - I’m inclined to agree. Clean, classic. Lovely.23 min: Good hands from Penaud, Dupont and Ollivon once again - this is running rugby at its finest! But it eventually goes to ground. A break in play for an injury concern, but we’re all clear. Nine offloads already, from the French. Wow.My, oh my! That was razzle dazzle stuff from the French! They didn’t have much room to operate in out wide, it was brilliant from Penaud, and he’s backed up on the inside by the scrum half, Dupont! He scores in the corner. Lovely.And would you believe it - from the touchline on the other side, it’s Ntamack who knocks over another perfect conversion.Argentina scratching their heads - what a lightning raid from the French!19 min: Ooph. Loose from Argentina - it’s Sanchez who fumbles with the ball and they’re forced to retreat and recover. A lot of vocal support for the French inside the stadium today, and they lift a gear every time Les Bleus get the ball.Lovely scamper from Ollivon, they’re picking and running here, building the phases. Still a bit loose, but Fickou to keep it alive.Terrific running rugby from the French! It’s Penaud who sparks it all with a lovely run - they swing the other side and it’s the two centres Vakatawa and Fickou who stop and start, and pick their way through the despairing Argentine defence.And it’s an excellent conversion attempt from the touchline, Ntamack adds the extras. There’s the response from France!15 min: France with a clever play, there’s a footrace for the corner, but Sanchez is there first to ground and Argentina drive the line dropout. Opportunity for the French to attack.No mistake this time from Sanchez, from near dead in front.They’ve started well, Argentina - some real momentum building there over the past few minutes. What can the French come up with?13 min: Sanchez looks to put first points on the board - but he misses the penalty attempt! Let’s hope that doesn’t prove critical.It’s a big run from Petti! He bashes and barges towards the line, two or three would-be defenders swatted aside - Argentina with a real chance here.11 min: Argentinian scrum - Angus Gardner wants it reset. What a battle this will be today. And it’s a penalty to the Pumas!Poirot pinged for not keeping his feet. I promise no jokes, but clearly that was one mystery he couldn’t solve for the French.9 min: Some early nerves, therefore, from both sides. No surprises there - it’s the first 10 minutes of the World Cup. Big clearing kick from Argentina. But Penaud is crunched by Creevy!The French are then penalised for a late hit - it’s marginal, and the crowd doesn’t like the decision.7 min: A clever popped-pass on the inside, but it’s heavy traffic as Argentina struggle to make inroads. Knock on, Argentina - but France have advantage and the crowd gets engaged as they move it, ball in hand.6 min: Ntamack flies high to claim the bomb, but he spills it forward. Argentina elect to take the lineout over the scrum - they feed right on halfway.4 min: Good defence, France - the metres are hard up the middle for Argentina. Sanchez looks for the short crossfield kick - but he’s misjudged that too! Into touch on the full - favour returned.3 min: Intercept! France attack, ball in hand. Brilliant work Ollivon - they have four v three on the outside, France, but they look to put it on the toe. Was that the play? It ricochets off the defender and the momentum is lost.First scrum, and first penalty! It’s the Argentine scrum that holds up first. Watch this space over the next 80.2 min: Ach, it’s a kicking error - not the perfect start for France, as that one flies into touch and just misses the mark. Argentina with the lineout feed just inside the French half.Allez, allez! It’s France who get us underway, and Argentina receive well, but don’t get too much distance on the clearance.First opportunity to run with ball in hand, they start just inside the Argentinian half, France.Anthems observed - and what an atmosphere we have here already. Not to pick favourites, but there are anthems, and there are anthems - and let’s admit it: La Marseillaise is an anthem.The French players belt it out with gusto. Let’s see if their early play matches that intensity.Australia’s Angus Gardner will be the man with the whistle.As always fire us your best insights, quips and quibbles - via email or twitter to join the coverage.

On paper it’s the World No 8 v the World No 11, but those numbers are almost meaningless, given the pedigree in both these sides.Two sides very strong at the scrum, with solid forward packs. France enjoys the historical edge between these two nations 36-14 with a solitary draw, but the Argentinians have beaten the French before at World Cup level.The French have been on the wane recently in the six nations, but try telling a nation that’s been to a World Cup final that they don’t know how to click on the biggest stage. Similarly, it wasn’t the best Rugby Championship campaign for Argentina, but at Super Rugby level the Jaguares were a rising force, so expect the national team to profit from that continuity and understanding.Plenty to like about both these sides - a tight one, and the ramifications for Pool C, and England, could be important.Pop the kettle on and settle in for this one!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4da596a805af995a16f08595c7481e510388e47/0_0_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=026bdd479b28357c2f050da20e63a8ec","title":"brad pitt snoop dogg asap rocky peaky blinders steven knight gangster series","story":"The world’s biggest stars are queuing up to be cast in the dandy gangster series. Ahead of the finale, creator Steven Knight talks about the show’s ‘bizarre, dream-like’ boomFrom the streets of Small Heath, Birmingham, to the news stands of Bogotá, we are now living in a Peaky Blinders world.The BBC first broadcast Steven Knight’s series about a gang of razor blade-wielding dandies in 2013. Six years later, its star Cillian Murphy, in character as Tommy Shelby, adorns the cover of Rolling Stone Colombia.The final episode of the fifth season will be shown on BBC One on Sunday evening, as the Shelbys tussle with fascist MP Oswald Mosley and a rival gang from Glasgow called the Billy Boys.As the Blinders scale new levels of popularity, thanks in no small part to Netflix streaming the show in 183 countries, it is no surprise to hear that A-list stars are contacting Knight asking to join the cast.“We get a lot of people who get in touch and want to take part,” he says. “There’s Brad Pitt. Snoop Dogg. A$AP Rocky, too. I think in series six we will open the door a little to get some celebrity actors in. The main thing is they have to be good. We’ll just get the best actor for the part, as we did with Sam Claflin, who plays Mosley. He’s perfect.”He does, however, rule out cameos for their own sake. “I always find it difficult when the audience knows a person from somewhere else and they just drop in. It’s very distracting.”Could he be referring to Ed Sheeran’s much-maligned appearance in Game of Thrones? “Well, there are some casualties along the road,” he says.Knight confirms Mosley will return in the sixth season and goes on to say that he has as good as cast an actor in the role of Diana Mitford, second wife to the leader of the British Union of Fascists, the party Mosley founded in 1932.While the Peaky Blinders are roughly based on a real-life gang and their enemies – former adversaries Billy Kimber and Darby Sabini did exist – the plot has played fast and loose with facts. With Mosley, the most well-known character depicted, Knight says his storyline will be more historically accurate.“What I’m trying to do is take history, and the specific things history notices, then write around the things that aren’t so known,” he says. “So Mosley was having an affair with his wife’s sister and stepmother, but history doesn’t count that, that isn’t what we know him for. But who the hell does that? He was charismatic and magnetic, which made his message seductive and enabled him to draw people in. I want to make people see that evil is seductive and that we need to be careful.“The rise of fascism, racism, national socialism and populism ... it’s happening now,” continues Knight. “I looked at Mosley’s speeches, and one of them began ‘Do not believe false news.’ He was telling people that the media was lying to them, that foreigners were taking things away from them. It’s my good fortune – but the world’s bad fortune – that these things are happening again and I can write about them. I just hope people realise that nine years after Mosley started making these speeches there was a world war. Let’s not do it again.”Knight is speaking at the the Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival and standing about 50 feet from the first reported crime by a Peaky Blinder – an assault in March 1890, years before the events depicted in the show. On the street below, there are thousands of fans dressed in period attire in tribute to their favourite characters.“It’s bizarre,” he says. “It’s like a dream.” A huge draw across the Midlands, there are fans from all over the UK, from France and Belgium. Earlier in the day, Knight met one fan who had travelled from Los Angeles.“It’s a whole world we’ve created, it’s more than just clothes and a good soundtrack,” he says. “I do lots of projects in film and TV. You have some that are lucky, and some that are unlucky. Peaky is the luckiest project I’ve ever been involved with. Every time we leap forward a couple of years, we hit a period of history that has such resonance. None more so than the current series. I don’t plan these things that far ahead, it just happens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7524fd1c33d10dba057a272429d25b4343e3170f/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d66b70a8c89eb1cba9cb4062c6ee998","title":"area 51 raid aliens events","story":"Photographer said it was unclear if arrests were made as crowd gathered at 3am Friday in response to hoax to ‘raid’ the baseAbout 75 people arrived early on Friday at a gate at the once secret Area 51 military base in Nevada at the time appointed by an internet hoaxster to “storm” the facility to see space aliens and at least two were detained by sheriff’s deputies.The Storm Area 51 invitation spawned festivals in the tiny Nevada towns of Rachel and Hiko nearest the military site, and a more than two-hour drive from Las Vegas.The Lincoln county sheriff, Kerry Lee, estimated late Thursday that about 1,500 people had gathered at the festival sites and said more than 150 people also made the rugged trip several additional miles on bone-rattling dirt roads to get within selfie distance of the gates.An Associated Press photographer said it wasn’t immediately clear if a woman who began ducking under a gate and a man who urinated nearby were arrested after the crowd gathered about 3am on Friday.Millions of people had responded to a June internet post calling for people to run into the remote US air force test site that has long been the focus of UFO conspiracy theories. “They can’t stop all of us,” the post joked. “Lets see them aliens.”The military responded with stern warnings that lethal force could be used if people entered the Nevada Test and Training Range, and local and state officials said arrests would be made if people tried.“It’s public land,” the sheriff said. “They’re allowed to go to the gate, as long as they don’t cross the boundary.”A music group called Wily Savage erected a stage on Thursday near the Little A’Le’Inn in Rachel and began playing after dark for several hundred campers who braved overnight temperatures about 45F (7C).The music kicked off weekend events inspired by an internet hoax to “see them aliens” that the Lincoln county sheriff, Kerry Lee, said had drawn perhaps 1,500 people to two tiny desert towns.Lee said late on Thursday that more than 150 people also made the rugged trip on washboard dirt roads to get within selfie distance of two gates to the Area 51 US air force installation that has long fueled speculation about government studies of space aliens and UFOs.The air force has issued stern warnings for people not to try to enter the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.Lee said no arrests were made.“It’s public land,” the sheriff said. “They’re allowed to go to the gate, as long as they don’t cross the boundary.”Authorities reported no serious incidents so far in Rachel and Hiko, the two towns closest to Area 51, on a road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway two hours from Las Vegas.Earlier in Rachel, Wily Savage guitarist Alon Burton said he saw a chance to perform for people who, like Martinez, were looking for a scene in which to be seen.“It started as a joke, but it’s not a joke for us,” he said. “We know people will come out. We just don’t know how many.”Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the event “a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies and the desire to know what we don’t know”.The result, Borer said, was “hope and fear” for events that include the “Area 51 Basecamp” featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko, and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name Alienstock.“People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,” Borer said. “Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can’t go. When you tell people they can’t do something, they just want to do it more.”Eric Holt, the Lincoln county emergency manager overseeing preparations, said he believed authorities could handle a total of 30,000 visitors to Rachel and Hiko.Still, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against “critters, snakes and scorpions”.“It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry,” Arnu said.

It instructs employees to prepare to take an exam on the “study Xi” propaganda app, launched earlier this year, in order to have their press credential renewed.Most believe the regulation will soon apply to Chinese reporters across the country. Journalists from three media organisations, two of which were outside Beijing, told the  their publications had also received informal notices to register on the app.“From the top down to the bottom, I don’t think anyone will be able to escape it,” said one reporter from a broadcaster in the eastern Shandong province who said he was not authorised to speak on the topic.The on-site, closed-book exam, to be administered by news organisations in early October, will be ided into five parts, including two on Xi Jinping’s teachings on socialism for the new era and Xi’s “important thoughts on propaganda”, according to Media Reform, a self-published news account on WeChat.News of the test, first reported by the South China Morning Post and the research programme China Media Project, comes as Chinese media face increasing restrictions. China is considered one of the least free countries to operate as a journalist, ranked 177 out of 180 in 2019 by Reporters Without Borders, above Eritrea and North Korea.While Chinese journalists face jail time and self-censorship is common, journalists especially from independent publications often push the envelope, investigating cases of local or corporate corruption. To get a press credential, journalists have previously been tested on their understanding of “Marxist journalistic ideals.”.“To be honest, it doesn’t mean that much,” the journalist from Shandong said. “Still, it’s a move to restrict public debate.”Authorities have stepped up their regulation of Chinese media and the internet, which already limits access to foreign websites, including news sites. In July, a draft regulation under China’s social credit system proposed punishing citizens for publishing information that “violates social morality” or causes “adverse social impacts”.Xi has demanded loyalty from Chinese journalists before. In 2016, he told staff at three state-run news outlets in Beijing that they were “the propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name”.According to Media Reform, the exam for journalists is not expected to be difficult. The notice sent to reporters from their editors said news organisations should establish study groups and begin preparing for the test. Sample questions will soon be uploaded to the app, according to the news website Sohu.The test will only be able to be retaken once. Journalists said they were not sure whether they would need to take it every time they renewed their press cards, done every five or six years.While some journalists said they resented the new rule, others were less critical. “Chinese society needs to strengthen political study and correctly lead public opinion,” said a reporter with a paper in the south-western province of Guizhou, who asked not to be named.“Western media may be able to report on anything they want, but they also still pay attention to the ideology of their countries,” he said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/567e0ffe54930b2a1f74e72075798f482da64cbe/0_284_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d3339e5fe6d4bc2f2b1b3136b9e5a64","title":"malta to launch public inquiry into of prominent journalist","story":"Daphne Caruana Galizia, who wrote a popular anti-corruption blog, was killed by a car bomb outside her homeFollowing international pressure, the government of Malta has said it will launch an independent public inquiry into the murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.Caruana Galizia, who wrote a popular anti-corruption blog, was killed by a car bomb outside her home on the island on 16 October 2017.Europe’s chief human rights watchdog, the Council of Europe, said in June that the failure to identify who was behind the murder raised questions about the rule of law in Malta.It gave Maltese authorities until 26 September to start a public inquiry aimed at establishing whether the journalist’s death could have been prevented.Three men have been under arrest since December 2017 and are due to stand trial for the murder. However, police are continuing their investigations to try to find out who ordered the killing, and why.The Malta government said the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, had appointed retired judge Michael Mallia to preside over the inquiry. He would be assisted by a law professor and a retired forensics expert.The government said that the independent review must not prejudice the active criminal investigation. It added that the inquiry should conclude its work within nine months.Muscat, a frequent target of Caruana Galizia’s writings, has offered a €1m ($1.1m) reward for information leading to the arrest of those behind her killing.Caruana Galizia published accusations of corruption, money laundering and influence-peddling by people at the highest levels of Maltese society, all of which they denied.Her family have repeatedly demanded a public inquiry, saying it was the best hope of uncovering the truth.

A Houthi military spokesman described the assault as a serious escalation and a reprisal for the Houthi-claimed assault on Saudi oil installations last weekend.Defending the attacks, the Saudi coalition spokesman, Turki Al-Malik, said: “The coalition’s naval forces detected an attempt by the terrorist Houthi militia backed by Iran to carry out an imminent act of aggression and terrorism in the southern Red Sea using an unmanned, rigged boat ... launched from Hodeidah province.”The Saudi attacks were seen by the Houthis as an attempted show of strength in response to the last Saturday’s devastating assault on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities, a strike that exposed the vulnerability of the Saudi oilfields to terrorism.The Houthis continue to claim responsibility for the attack on the facilities which temporarily knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity, and raised deep questions about Saudi Arabia’s ability to press ahead with its IPO sale. Videos showing cars queuing for petrol in Saudi Arabia were posted on social media.Both Riyadh and Washington are continuing to point the finger directly at Iran, with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, describing the attack as an act of war by Tehran.3m people forced to flee their homes.85,000 -\u0026nbsp Save the Children estimate that this number of children under the age of 5 may have died through hunger and malnutrition.1m cases of cholera in 2017, the largest outbreak of the disease in recent history. 2,200 people died during it.

Two of the experts have previous knowledge of the weapons used in the four-year Yemen civil war.The Saudi government also took representatives from international media to Abqaiq and Khurais to show the extraordinary scale of the damage and assure that the sites would be back to full production capacity within a month or two.Riyadh told reporters that the assaults, a mixture of cruise missiles and drones, came from the direction of Iran and the weaponry deployed is not in the possession of the Houthis.Saudi Arabia has not identified the precise point from which the attack was launched, but unnamed US intelligence sources claim it was southern Iran, and the attack was undertaken with the knowledge of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said such such claims are false and designed to distract attention from Saudi breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen.The focus of the dispute is likely to move next week to New York where Zarif is expected to meet European foreign ministers, including the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, at the UN general assembly. The chances of a direct meeting between the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and Donald Trump is ruled out by Iran, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is likely to try to act as a mediator between the two sides since he will hold bilateral meetings with both men.Seeking a resolution is complicated by the political chaos inside the Saudi-backed Yemen government, as well as a dispute between Yemen and one of its nominal supporters, the United Arab Emirates. In a sign of the collapse of trust, Yemen’s transport minister, Saleh Al-Jubwani, accused the UAE on twitter of supporting al-Qaida in Yemen to undermine the government.Yemen’s president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, issued a decree on Thursday evening appointing new foreign and finance ministers in a cabinet reshuffle to lead the key state institutions. He appointed the former ambassador Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed Al-Hadrami as minister of foreign affairs, replacing Khaled al-Yamani, who resigned last June. He also appointed the fourth head of the Central Bank in as many years.In London Boris Johnson met the emir of Qatar on Saturday and in a statement from No 10 stressed Downing Street is seeking to de-escalate the crisis through negotiation.

Demands have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.A pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up the approximately 100 “Lennon Walls around the city on Saturday.The walls are named after the John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague in the 1980s that was covered with Beatles lyrics and messages of political grievance.However, in a message posted late on Friday his Facebook page on Friday, Ho said “for the sake of safety” the Lennon Walls would not be cleared up, only the streets.“We will clean up the environment with a peaceful and rational attitude,” he said.The anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing on Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including the right of assembly and an independent judiciary.China says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” arrangement and denies interfering. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.The demonstrations have taken on their own rhythm over the months and now tend to peak on the weekends, often with anti-government activists, many masked and in black, throwing petrol bombs at police, trashing metro stations, blocking airport roads and lighting street fires.At times, they have been confronted by supporters of Beijing wielding sticks. More pro-democracy protests are planned this weekend including a sit in the Yuen Long suburban subway station, marking two months since activists were attacked by a mob there.A large protest was planned for Saturday afternoon in Tuen Mun but the local rail station was closed by the authorities ahead of the event. A sit-in was planned for Saturday evening at Yuen Long station but that was also closed.The city’s transit operator, MTR Corp, said it would close train stations near potential protest sites, including Yuen Long and Tuen Mun, for safety reasons starting from early afternoon.Protesters had said on Friday that while they did not want violence, they would defend themselves if they were attacked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c824d451ad2ae307665d184b75e97f8bd7c84d1/0_191_2181_1309/master/2181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=decdf175b4a008ddfd04dda2b6b8bb59","title":"voices for the future climate activism lights up the un headquarters new york in pictures","story":"The United Nations headquarters in New York plays host to an immersive art installation by artist Joseph Michael that features images of an iceberg and six young advocates including Greta Thunberg addressing hopes and fears around the climate crisis and the urgent actions that must be taken"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4025201.1568998185!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how climate action children are winning over parents","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tÁine Nic Chárthaigh and her daughter Iona Logan (17), from Raheen, Limerick. She says her daugher has helped her become more eco-conscious. Photograph: Liam BurkePress 22Áine Nic Chárthaigh, a mother of one in Limerick City, has always considered herself a fairly committed environmentalist.That was until her daughter, Iona (17), began to get on her case.“She’s picking me up on anything where I can be more environmentally-friendly,” she says. “ If she catches me with plastics of any kind, she’s constantly pointing it out. We’ve no clingfilm now. It’s beeswax wraps.“Iona’s always giving out to me about driving. So, this year we decided not to do any air travel for the family holiday. And she wants to be vegan and vegetarian, so we’ve dramatically reduced our meat consumption in the house.”Some parents might roll their eyes and see these demands as just another passing teenage fad. But Áine thinks something bigger and much more fundamental is happening.“Young people are taking ownership of issues around climate change,” she says. “They’re reading the reports themselves on this – I don’t even know adults who do that. They are highly committed and influencing the rest of us . . . It means we all have to change our ways. It requires a bit more effort, but in the greater scheme of things, it is worth the effort. And it’s down to this generation.”Iona was one of thousands of young people marching through the streets on Friday demanding that adults in power take action on climate change. While the jury is still out on how effective the movement will be, there are early indications that young people may actually be highly effective in changing the behaviour of adults.A team of social scientists in a US university recently authored a study which found that children can increase their parents’ level of concern about climate change because, unlike adults, their views on the issue do not generally reflect any entrenched political ideology.Researchers tested how 10- to 14–year-olds’ exposure to climate change coursework affected not only the youngsters’ views, but those of their parents.The results suggest that conversations between generations may be a very effective starting point in combating the effects of a warming environmentDanielle Lawson of North Carolina State University, the paper’s lead author, says: “This study tells us that we can educate children about climate change and they’re willing to learn, which is exciting because studies find that many adults are resistant to climate education, because it runs counter to their personal identities.”She says it “also highlights that children share that information with their parents, particularly if they’re given tools to facilitate communication – and that parents are willing to listen”. Some students at North Wicklow Educate Together Secondary School in Bray are seeing this first hand. Their awakening to climate activism came in the classroom in the form of an hour a week course on sustainability that was trialled in their school.It sparked a group of them to form Student Climate Activist Network, which was one of the groups centrally involved in mobilising Friday’s protest.Gráinne O’Sullivan (14) says the group has helped their families to make positive and sustainable changes in their lifestyles – more vegetarian meals and rethinking modes of transport and other lifestyle changes.But, she says, this is only the start.“Inidual actions are so good and they make people aware – but it’s not enough. We need systemic change. Buying a bamboo toothbrush isn’t going to save the planet.”As much as they see adults in power as being part of the problem, they also see them as the solution. In a change from earlier protests, Friday’s strikes explicitly invited adults and campaign groups to join them in their demonstrations.Molly Mercier Redmond (15) says trade unions and environmental groups have been hugely supportive.“They are standing behind and alongside us, but not in front of us and are conscious not to block our voices,” she says. “Then there are adults in the Dáil . . . who are a bit of an obstacle, but we need them to help us to get to where we want to be.”There’s a recognition among the students that if adults are to be won over, then changes will have to be affordable and accessible to all. Simply hoping people will accept higher taxes or buy expensive electric cars, they say, isn’t realistic.Given growing anxiety levels among young people today, there are some who worry that we are making things far worse by encouraging protest surely, we should let children be children instead of eco-worriers and let adults shoulder with the world’s problems?“We weren’t forced into this,” says Gráinne O’Sullivan. “We saw the inaction of the governments and people in power and we took that step to make our voices hear . . . It’s our future which will be affected.”While youth-led campaigns have persuaded adults in power to put climate issues to the fore, tangible political successes are few, so far. In business, however, the eco-awakening is having a distinct impact.Jane McDaid, founder of youth marketing agency Thinkhouse, says she sees businesses who are fundamentally rethinking how they do things to be more responsible and sustainable.“I think the days of ‘greenwashing’ are over – young people are far too smart and when they witness greenwashing, they’re motivated to call it out which ends up being a huge embarrassment to brandsorganisations,” she says.“Brands know that younger consumers are voting with their wallets and they are supporting brands and businesses that are truly aligned with their values.”According to the NYU Stern School for Sustainable Business, between 2013 and last year, sustainably marketed products grew 5.6 times faster than those not marketed as good for the planet.Unilever’s Sustainable Living Brands grew almost 70 per cent faster than the rest of the business and are delivering 75 per cent of the company’s growth.Adults, it seems, are catching on fast due in no small part to the zeal of younger people – and their ability to influence their parents.How is mankind affecting the global climate and what can be done about it?"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Political headwinds against radical change, especially from the US, may frustrate agendaThousands protest in Dublin and countrywide urging Government responseDentistry is unique in Ireland in that fitness-to-practise hearings are held in privateHSE budget overrun hits \u0026euro230 million up to end of July, despite spending curbsActivist Greta Thunberg joins demonstration as crowds bring New York to standstillMassive rally in support of Kevin Lunny at Quinn Industrial Holdings HQGreen Party and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil describe children\u0026rsquos protests as \u0026lsquomoving\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoinspirational\u0026rsquoPage administrator says they are \u0026lsquoabsolutely serious\u0026rsquo about political partyAbout 500 people including political leaders turn out for rally in support of Kevin LunneyOnly three protests lifted since deal, according to beef farmer groupRose Gottemoeller made her comments in Dublin as Isis bride Lisa Smyth in SyriaColleagues are reflecting on the Quinn executive\u0026rsquos suffering \u0026ndash and the risks they now faceSimon Harris has a \u0026lsquodiary issue\u0026rsquo that prevents him addressing the IHCA on SaturdayTurn-over rate is much higher than Government figures, says military officers groupCoalition urges Taoiseach to support more ambitious EU target for cutting emissionsProtests mark 1st anniversary of Greta Thurnberg\u0026rsquos solo school strike in StockholmThomas Flanagan and Jean Errity took loans for property development hit by planning difficulties\u0026lsquoNo smoking, no drinking and no men\u0026rsquo, contributed to woman\u0026rsquos longevity"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4025330.1569011017!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord s week paschal gets a birthday surprise from javid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and UK chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid at Farmleigh House. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyNews outlets were advised by the Department of Finance that the meeting between Paschal Donohoe and his UK counterpart, Sajid Javid, on Thursday would be a photo opportunity only. No provision for media questions.This did not deter the reporters, who trooped along anyway in the hope of getting a few Brexit-related lines from the two money men.Paschal was first to arrive because he had to perform the big welcome under the portico. There were no security restrictions in place, apart from a roped-off area for photographers in front of Farmleigh House. On such a lovely day, visitors were enjoying the grounds around the estate, including a seven-strong group of women on a day trip from Thurles. When they noticed the media activity, they went for a closer look and saw the Minister for Finance, dimples dancing in the sunlight.With a few minutes to spare, the politician in Paschal found it impossible to resist this pleasant group of ladies waving and calling his name. He ambled over.An adviser let slip that it was his birthday. He’s 45. There were photographs taken and then the Thurles contingent serenaded the beaming Minister with a very harmonious warbling of Happy Birthday.“Thank you very much!”This touching interlude gave the scheming hacks an idea. They knew that unless they could grab the attention of one of the Ministers, any shouted questions would be smilingly ignored.Javid landed and the handshakes commenced. In time-honoured tradition, the politicians studiously ignored the journalists. Suddenly a voice bellowed, Downing Street-style, from the rabble.“Chancellor, do you know it’s the Minister’s birthday?”The chancellor instinctively pivoted, a manoeuvre more usually associated with his boss and the truth.Looking momentarily terrified by this briefing oversight, the UK visitor quickly regained his composure. In the rocky world of British-Irish relations in these Brexit-strained times, Paschal and Sajid have had three meetings in recent weeks. That almost makes them best pals.“Yes. I bought him a present but I can’t tell you what it is,” he told Virgin Media’s Gavan Reilly. Contact established, the men were drawn into a reluctant exchange.Might the present involve the unwrapping of some common ground on Brexit? And what did both sides think of a speech made by UK Brexit secretary Steve Barclay in Madrid earlier in the day?So the finance ministers were forced into saying nothing of import, but on the record, about the special relationship between Ireland and the UK while simultaneously avoiding any public comment on Barclay’s robust remarks.A belated happy birthday to the deputy for Dublin Central and we hope he gets to enjoy a nice meal and a few pints this weekend. Young Paschal (45) spent the night of his birthday in a meeting on Brexit with Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed.From Labour to lobbyistFormer Labour senator and general election candidate Lorraine Higgins will be appointed Honorary Consul to the Slovak Republic at a reception in the embassy in Merrion Square on Thursday. She left active political life a number of years ago but is still a leading light – not to mention a rare female presence – in the Oireachtas Golf Society.Her sister Clodagh is now a councillor in Galway, although her party of preference is Fine Gael.Lorraine became chief executive of the trade group Retail Excellence after failing to win a Dáil seat in 2016. She has since moved on to corporate communications agency MKC, where she is director of strategy and public policy – a fancy name for political lobbyist. She filled the gap left by the departure of former Fine Gael media director and ministerial adviser Ciarán Conlon, who left for Microsoft.Speaking of fierce big jobs, former taoiseach Enda Kenny’s chief of staff, Mark Kennelly, landed what many would call a dream gig this week when he was appointed the first chief executive of Golf Ireland. The Kerry man is a member of Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.With all the work he has to do, not least with the Ryder Cup in Adare on the horizon, Mark will hardly have time to swing a club.Knock, Knock, Leo’s thereLeo Varadkar has settled into the routine once faithfully followed by general election specialist Bertie Ahern, travelling around the country on available Fridays to get maximum exposure in the local mediaThis week Leo went to Mayo, starting in Knock airport before taking in Castlebar, Ballina and Shrule near the Galway border.He cut the ribbon on Knock airport’s refurbished runway. Just as well the runway is the third-largest in the country because a lot of tarmac was needed to accommodate the amount of dignitaries gathered for the ceremony.Leo retold the story of how townie politicians dismissed Msgr James Horan’s grand vision for an airport and how a Fine Gael minister (it was the late Jim Mitchell) famously described the site in 1984 as “far distant from any sizeable town, high on a foggy, boggy hill”.More than 30 years on, Ireland West Airport is proof “that white elephants can fly”. A comforting thought, perhaps, for a Taoiseach constantly battling criticism of government infrastructure projects.The parish priest of Knock, Fr Richard Gibbons, thought Leo might need some ine intervention on the Brexit situation.“Taoiseach, I know you’re going to New York next week and meeting Boris Johnson,” he smiled, before handing him a tiny bottle. “A small little bit of added protection for you.”To applause and much guffawing, Leo held up the holy water. “Do I throw it over him or what?”“Oh, you can, you can!” laughed Fr Gibbons.Apparently the good father’s harmless joke has now gone viral, outraged Brexiteers are losing the plot on social media and the permanently indignant are having a field day over the Catholic Church’s stance on homosexuality.Ploughing off courseWe bumped into Mattie McGrath at the National Ploughing Championships on Thursday afternoon. He seemed in a rush and somewhat hot and bothered.The independent TD for Tipperary and member of the Dáil’s Rural Independents Group explained that he had only just arrived. He had hoped to get in much earlier but there had been a bit of a mix-up and they got lost in the car on the way to Fenagh. Which is why we found him barrelling up the steel walkway at speed, wearing his full suit in the sweltering conditions.“I hadn’t time to change,” he said.It seems Mattie took a lift with his Fianna Fáil colleague and TD for Cork East, Kevin O’Keeffe. Kevin put on the GPS and off they went, following the satnav directions to the letter.When the two boys reached their “destination” they knew they had veered substantially off course.According to Mattie, when Kevin keyed in “National Ploughing Association”, the satnav took them to the gates of Anna May McHugh’s farmhouse in Laois. The indomitable Anna May is the power behind the Ploughing.McGrath wasn’t overly concerned about arriving late but O’Keeffe was anxious to link up with the Fianna Fáil contingent and show his face before his leader Micheál Martin left the scene.Ross has a lot on his plateWhen Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan waylaid Shane Ross after the first Cabinet meeting of the new season and presented him with a commemorative plate featuring Shankill Garda station, the Minister for Transport looked most gratified.But it was all a little strange. Had it been specially commissioned? Why would Charlie Flanagan do this when Ross has been the bane of his life with his crusade over reopening Shankill Garda station along with his determination to push the Judicial Appointments Bill through the Oireachtas, no matter how long Flanagan has endured the Seanad filibuster against it.It wasn’t a special piece. The Minister for Justice spotted it while browsing through bric-a-brac in an antiques shop while on holidays in Connemara. The plate was part of a series featuring scenes from south Co Dublin. Charlie wasn’t keen on buying the complete set so he stuck a deal with the owner and came away with the one he wanted.While it clearly wasn’t too expensive, the Minister is refusing to say how much he paid.Charlie and Shane are both beaming broadly as the gift is handed over in Government Buildings. That was nearly three weeks ago, before the Minister for Transport knew Stepaside Garda station would not be open to the public on a 24-hour basis, despite his assurances to the contrary.Only one of them is smiling now. And it isn’t Ross, but at least he has a new china plate to hang on the wall.Big in JapanThe sense of drift in the nation will be reversed on Tuesday, September 24th, when Seanad Éireann finally gets back to business after the summer break.All Senators are expected to muster for duty, including the four from Fine Gael who flew to Japan for two weeks for the Parliamentary World Cup rugby tournament. The Dáil and Seanad XV made it to the semi-finals, winning the Plate match against Japan. New Zealand took the honours.No TDs went on the trip, with the Fine Gael four the only elected representatives on a team drawn in the main from Leinster House staff.The Senators have been quick to point out they travelled when the Upper House was in recess and everyone paid their own way – flights, accommodation, insurance and specially made deckchair-striped Alickadoo jackets.Neale Richmond, sporting the remains of a black eye, took a break from his sporting holiday to brief business leaders on EU Brexit developments at a conference in Japan’s Keizai Koho Forum. He also met government trade representatives in Tokyo. The other Senators on the trip were Catherine Noone from Dublin, Maria Byrne from Limerick and Tony Lawless from Kildare.While the politicians may have paid their own way, it hasn’t stopped a few Fine Gael eyebrows rising in their absence. Three of them – Richmond (Dublin-Rathdown), Noone (Dublin Bay North) and Lawless (Kildare South) – are running in the general election, and some party colleagues are wondering about the wisdom of taking off for Japan with talk in the air of a snap election in eight weeks’ time.The travelling party seems to have had a great time. A Japanese commuter posted a video on Twitter of the tired-looking team lustily singing The Black Velvet Band while on the Tokyo underground (Hanzomon Line). It is a sight to behold."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"National unity administration looms as president to begins talks with party leadersRebuff by Blue and White leader deepens political crisis and raises spectre of third electionTaliban claims responsibilty along with near-daily attacks since collapsed US peace talksDespite Benny Gantz\u0026rsquos essential similarity, many deem Netanyahu far more dangerousIsrael poll serious setback for Likud as Gantz\u0026rsquos Blue and White party edge into leadNetanyahu faces fight for survival as Likud party fails to secure Knesset majorityRuling Likud party likely to fall short of majority in tightly contested electionYemen\u0026rsquos Houthi rebels have the motive and necessary skills to strike Aramco oil facilitiesTrump says US is \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo and awaiting verification on culpritDamascus International Fair\u0026rsquos success masks issues with rebuilding the Syrian economyLocal council and medical worker say 15 injured and damage caused to hospitalGroup will meet to try to secure lasting truce in northwest amid threat of further turmoilForeign ministry counters accusations from US secretary of state with threats to US basesDrone strikes on oil production plants could have impact on global energy pricesYemen\u0026rsquos Houthi rebels claim strike targeting facilities operated by Saudi AramcoWhite House statement does not say when Hamza was killed or how death was confirmedLikud and Blue and White locked tightly as rivals with Yisrael Beiteinu likely kingmakerSahar Khodayari (29) died this week after her arrest for trying to enter a football stadiumText of recordings of dissident\u0026rsquos killing in consulate published in Turkish newspaperThe two were reportedly seized in separate incidents and are being held in Tehran"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4025178.1568996793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"israel to begin tortuous task of forming a government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNeither Benny Gantz nor Binyamin  Netanyahu will receive the support of a majority 61 Knesset members to form a coalition. Israel’s president Reuven Rivlin will on Sunday begin consultations with heads of the parties elected to the new Knesset, following this week’s election which resulted in a political stalemate. After hearing their recommendations he will task one of the party leaders with forming the next government. Alternatively, if he believes that no leader will have a realistic chance of cobbling together a working coalition, he may summon the leaders of the two largest parties – Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White and prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu of Likud – to tell them that a national unity coalition is the best option to avoid Israel going to the polls for the third time in a year.Blue and White ended up as the biggest party with 33 seats, compared to the Likud, which won 31.Neither Gantz nor Netanyahu will receive the support of a majority 61 Knesset members to form a coalition. The kingmaker will be Avigdor Lieberman, head of the right-wing, secular Yisrael Beiteinu (eight seats), who insists that the only viable option to break the deadlock is a Blue and White-Likud-Yisrael Beiteinu unity government. He went so far as to tell Gantz and Netanyahu not to waste time calling him if they are not on board.Even under normal circumstances, coalition building in Israel is an arduous task. After the April elections Netanyahu’s potential partners failed to agree on a Bill for drafting the ultra-Orthodox, prompting Netanyahu to call a snap September election.This time, the fact that Netanyahu is facing corruption charges with a pre-trial only two weeks away has further complicated the picture. Blue and White say they are open to serving in a unity government with Likud, but not if it is led by Netanyahu if he is indicted.Netanyahu’s manoeuvringNetanyahu’s hopes of passing a Bill granting him immunity went out the window with the election result. But he has not acknowledged defeat and is still fighting to win a fifth term as prime minister. He is keeping all his options open, speaking in favour of a unity government while forming a joint bloc with the rightreligious parties to stop Gantz forming a coalition. Blue and White dismissed Netanyahu’s call for unity as a cynical political stunt. “Since when does a person who loses an election invite the winner to be a partner in his government?” said a senior party official.Ben Caspit, commentator for the Ma’ariv newspaper, likened post-election Netanyahu to a drunk-driver of a bus. “The problem is that we are the passengers in this bus. If it crashes, we crash. Binyamin Netanyahu cannot, even for a second, concede the prime minister’s residence on Balfour Street. He has indictments hanging over his head like a sword. He must remain prime minister, at any price. We are his hostages.” When Netanyahu addressed the Likud faithful on election night activists chanted, “We don’t want unity!” But it looks like the only realistic choice may be a unity coalition or a third election."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: The Remainer elite is laughing in the face of our historyDiana\u0026#39s former private secretary: Prince Harry is following in his mother\u0026#39s footsteps – but must chart his own pathComment: Victoria Coren Mitchell: \u0026#39We are suffering from an overdose of reality - and it\u0026#39s TV\u0026#39s fault\u0026#39Comment: We must challenge the intellectuals attacking meritocracy Comment: Many children grow up today never having left towns and cities to see our beautiful national parksComment: Life lessons in schools shouldn’t stop at stand-up comedyUnited States announces military response and Iran sanctions after attacks on Saudi oil facilitiesJohn Humphrys says BBC \u0026#39simply could not grasp\u0026#39 why anyone would vote for Brexit in new memoir   John McDonnell escalates Labour\u0026#39s \u0026#39class war\u0026#39 with pledge to abolish non-dom statusBrexit latest news: EU hatches plot to sink Britain\u0026#39s Brexit planYouTube \u0026#39kidfluencers\u0026#39 at risk of exploitation, Children\u0026#39s Commissioner warnsComment: With John Humphrys gone, who at the BBC will take the side of the listeners?Momentum chief ambushes Tom Watson and calls for Labour members to abolish his role as deputy leaderArnhem may have been the right strategy, but it was too small, poorly planned and badly ledMayfair cleared of homeless \u0026#39tent city\u0026#39 amid fears of crime waveComment: Arnhem may have been \u0026#39fatally flawed\u0026#39, but \u0026#39continues to inspire\u0026#39 to this dayInside the Saudi oil plants hit in drone attack blamed on IranJustin Trudeau struggles to get re-election campaign back on track as blackface incidents mountWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/17/gettyimages-586113592.jpg","title":"airbnb stock market float public 2020 announcement","story":"Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Premium free for 1 monthSee the optionsHome rentals site lays out much-anticipated plans for listingAirbnb has said it intends to become a publicly traded company in 2020, in what will be one of the most high-profile listings of the year.The announcement brings to an end months of speculation about when the company that has upended the hotels and home rental markets might finally go public.This week, Airbnb\u0026nbspreported that its revenues had topped $1bn (£800m) in the second quarter of 2019.\u0026nbspHosts have made more than $80bn on bookings made through the site since it started.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions. Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Thomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspDover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said.

They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

I have already asked the FE Commissioner to urgently look into this matter.“School and college leaders must treat taxpayers’ money with the utmost care and in a way that benefits their students. Where this does not happen we take the strongest possible action.”But Ms Mbubaegbu defended the expenses claimed for international travel saying the work was done to increase the college’s reputation overseas and to create additional income.“Chief executives of further education colleges have found ourselves under fire in recent years within a context in which there is extreme pressure to generate income to survive,” she said.In a statement, the principal said her foreign travel helped to attract £2.5m of additional income from international business development activities over the past four years. \u0026nbsp“The expenses referred to in the article were approved and authorised correctly and are also subject to independent audit in accordance with college procedures,” Ms Mbubaegbu said.The principal added that a large amount of the expenses was reimbursed to the college through grants or other funding and some expenses were to cover travel and CPD events for other staff.The figures come after a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) revealed this week that a government pledge to boost funding for\u0026nbspsixth forms\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcolleges\u0026nbspwill leave them £1.1bn short of what they need to reverse cuts felt over the past nine years.School sixth forms have faced budget cuts of 23 per cent since 2010-2011, and spending for colleges have declined by 12 per cent over the same period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet.

Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.In the UK, Hustlers has a 15 certificate due to its “sexualised nudity, strong sex references, language and drug misuse”.It has\u0026nbspreceived acclaim from critics and consumers in the UK, but was recently criticised by the woman whose story inspired the film.This is not the first time a movie\u0026nbsphas encountered difficulties around its Malaysian release.

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed.

Nasa’s failure to spot the 100-metre wide space rock highlighted longstanding concerns about a lack of US government funding for asteroid detection efforts.“This object slipped through a whole series of our capture nets, for a bunch of different reasons,” Dr Paul Chodas, manager of Nasa’s Centre for Near Earth Object Studies, wrote to colleagues on 26 July.“So, was this just a particularly sneaky asteroid?

By the time it sped up it was too close to a nearly full moon for astronomers to detect, according to the emails.A planetary defence officer at Nasa had written that 2019 OK appeared to be the largest asteroid to pass so close to earth in the last century.

Lets see them aliens.”The page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.Storm Area 51 event could be disaster, locals fearBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base – and US Air Force spokesperson\u0026nbspLaura McAndrews\u0026nbspwas one of a number of officials who\u0026nbspgave a stern warning to anyone who did.Ms McAndrews added: “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Last month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I really think the only democratic way to get through this and to break the logjam is to go back to the people and trust their good sense.”Ms Swinson responded: “Comparing a UK political party to the Taliban is ludicrous. Emily is the shadow foreign secretary, and should use language that reflects the importance of that role.”And Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson\u0026nbspChuka Umunna said Ms Thornberry should “withdraw her inappropriate remarks”.Mr Umunna said: “Language counts – comparing the Lib Dems to a murderous organisation is no laughing matter.

In an apparent act of revenge, she was passed over for the stand-in slot when the leader was absent for prime minister’s questions.Thornberry and Corbyn meet with the PM of Iceland, Katrin Jakobsdottir, in Westminster in May (Getty)And she played down the significance of Labour deputy leader Tom Watson’s call for a second referendum before a general election, saying: “It’s just how he is, isn’t it? I haven’t seen him for a while ...\u0026nbspBut he’s deputy leader and he can say what he wants.”Ms Thornberry recently got into difficulties on TV trying to explain Labour’s position on Brexit.But she defended the position, saying: “We are now wedded to having a second referendum because so much has changed since three years ago. The question then is what will the choice be. We don’t want to put these lousy Tory choices of no deal or Theresa May’s deal to the public. We want there to be two good choices.“I would say ‘anything other than leaving the European Union’ is not a good choice but it would be second best. We need to have a choice that will look after jobs and the economy as best we can, which means being in the customs union and being close to the single market.“We’ve said we need, before we do finally leave, to have it confirmed with the public\u0026nbspif they do want to leave, this is a way that makes sense, or we remain. It’s important that we’re clear about that, but I’m never going to be able to do anything other than campaign to remain because I think we should be in the EU.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting. These jellies are incredibly rare and this new South African species is no exceptionLincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee estimated that about 1,500 people had gathered at the festival sites and said more than 150 people also made the rugged trip several additional miles on bone-rattling dirt roads to get within selfie distance of the gates.Another group of about 40 people gathered at a different gate in the\u0026nbspAmargosa Valley.The military had issued stern warnings that lethal force could be used if people entered the Nevada Test and Training Range, and local and state officials said arrests would be made if people tried.It\u0027s public land, the sheriff said.

One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.The entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Centre souvenir store in Hiko.Owner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.Authorities reported no serious incidents related to the festivals, which were\u0026nbspscheduled to last until Sunday.Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u0027t know.YouTuber sentenced to jail after attempting to film Area 51People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve, he said. Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u0027t go.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His new stance is even more laughable than last week’s, when he pledged to negotiate a “better” EU deal but campaign against it.Now he would put his deal to a second referendum but express no preference between that and remaining in the EU.He hasn’t a clue. He couldn’t say. It’s too hard. The Leader of the Opposition’s mind is a blank — not for the first time.He would merely “carry out whatever the people decide” . . . er, exactly as Boris Johnson would be doing NOWLabour wasn’t blocking him.Why does Corbyn, having failed to respect the first vote, imagine anyone trusts him to enact the result of a second The only certainty is that he WILL sell Leavers down the river, as The Sun predicted.Corbyn’s “Leave” deal would keep us in the EU’s customs union, handing it control of our economy while surrendering all our political influence.That’s the worst possible option. It’s not “leaving” at all. It’s Remain by another name. Corbyn is too dim to see it.His second referendum would thus be “Remain minus” vs Remain — a farce, absurdly biased and totally illegitimate.This coward, ditherer and fool could yet run the country, God help us.REMEMBER how our “broken” economy only works “for the few” Inflation is now just . per cent as pay leaps by . per cent, its fastest in  years.Everyone’s standard of living is rising.Remember Project Fear’s scares about the immediate catastrophe of voting Leave  A pack of lies.Unemployment is at a -year low, employment at an all-time high, thanks to new full-time jobs.Remember how the City would become a jobless wasteland  It is still easily the biggest global foreign exchange hub and pulling even further away from the competition.If this is how Britain shrugs off political mayhem, imagine what we will do once Brexit is done and uncertainty lts.VANESSA George’s crimes were wicked beyond belief.Some of the children she violated still suffer. So do their parents. So do others who still don’t even know whether their kids were abused because she refuses to say.This evil paedophile should not have been freed, even after ten years.

Not unless we want to be ruled by unelected judges and unelected millionaire litigants, on top of unelected peers and unaccountable Speakers.Andthese judges do now demand Parliament’s recall, what will Remainer MPs do with all their new sitting time They have already passed their law to “prevent No Deal”.

It must now reinstate the £million taken from respite care and vital equipment.Then we will truly celebrate.AFTER  years of negotiation, the EU’s huge trade deal with South America is vetoed by a single Austrian sub-committee.Proving two things: That an organisation so unwieldy is virtually incapable of making trade deals and Britain will be infinitely more nimble outside it.And that it is, sadly, delusional now to believe we could strike one with Brussels before the hated backstop kicked in.That’s why it must be killed off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is what it is fam. The dirty ****.Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to keep him enticed and draw him in.Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should play it smooth - make him want this now.She sent the player a number of provocative messages ahead of their meeting, Simon Jones, prosecuting, said.He told the jury: The picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is - it is all a sting.In one message, Wood told Tyrone Coleman: Something Im hella nervous about. What other girl would be willing to do this for you  As well as it benefits all of us I know.Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player - discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room - to Rowe.The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged general chit chat on social media before meeting at a hotel.He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived - sending him the room number in a message.On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed nervous and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were only going there for one thing.All of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room, he told jurors.One of the guys said something like: Is this what you are doing . It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged.I managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was.The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived.His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it.Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai.The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, , who was charged with handling stolen goods.After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Woods phone, stating that he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and telling him to contact a number.I dont really want to expose you to the media butyou dont respond within  hours then you leave me no choice, it said.When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: Obviously it is blackmail.Thats what they wanted to do - to get footage of me and take it to the papers.Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner.She said: I had previously asked himhe did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I askinghe was single, she said.I wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, its not right.She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money.He was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down, Wood told the court.The key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room.She said it did not go to plan as the footballer jumped out of the window before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Prince Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial will continue on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn rules out coalition","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn rules out coalitionLabour cant get General Election majorityOn the eve of Labour Party Conference in Brighton the party leader said his party would not strike a deal with other opposition partiesShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video labour-autumn-party-conference-preview-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

I am not doing coalitions,” he told UTV. Earlier John McDonnell told the Mirror, Labour would not go in with the Lib Dems or SNP post-election.“We’ll not do it with any of them,” he said. “We’ll go in, we’ll get a majority govt,we don’t get a majority Government we’ll go in as a minority party Government.  “We’ll implement the manesto. If any of those minor parties refuse to support us we’ll go back to the people.”   It comes after Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry compared the Liberal Democrats to the “Taliban” for their position of cancelling Brexit. She said: “I don’t think it’s very democratic to seek to overturn a referendum without asking the people first.”  Mr Corbyn defended his party’s Brexit policy of seeking to negotiate a new deal with Brussels and then putting it to the public in a referendum along with the option to remain in the EU, without coming down on either side.  He rejected criticism that his policy was a “muddle” and that he was failing to offer leadership on an issue of crucial national importance. “I am not sitting on the fence,” he told YTV.  “I think leadership comes from listening. I think leadership comes from asking people to look at the realities of the situation.  “It is not a muddled position. It is a position that takes the issue seriously.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour hire 5000 new gps","story":"NewsLabour will hire , new GPs a year to end crisis in local surgeriesEXCLUSIVE: The new plans, unveiled by Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth, would see the creation of  million extra GP appointments a yearShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  SEP NewsLabour estimate their plans could create an extra  million GP appointments a year\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who said Universal Credit would have left her with £. for a month has lost a High Court fight against the government. Charmaine Parkin, , said the six-in-one benefit threatened to push her out of self-employment by leaving her high and dry in spells when she found little work. Lawyers for the actor said the way UC was set up for self-employed people was “unjustied discrimination” and “irrational” - in a case that could have affected almost , people. But today a High Court judge dismissed her case, saying the regulations had been subject to the highest level of Parliamentary scrutiny. Justice Elisabeth Laing said claimants were not entitled to be subsidised to the same extent they were under the previous rules. She accepted employed and self-employed people are treated dferently on UC - but said that dference was not manestly without reasonable foundation.   Instead, the judge suggested, Universal Credit aimed to force people to quit unprofitable self-employment as their main job and look for better-paid work.Lawyers today confirmed Ms Parkin will not appeal. Ms Parkin did not want to comment today but her lawyer Tessa Gregory, of Leigh Day, said: It is disappointing that the High Court has decided to rule in favour of the Government. Universal Credit is failing to provide proper support for the self-employed, which is nearly a sixth of the UK’s workforce. If Ms Parkin had won her judicial review, it could have forced the DWP into a U-turn to help nearly , self-employed claimants of UC. Her lawyers Leigh Day were arguing over a key part of the benefit for self-employed people called the Minimum Income Floor . The MIF bans self-employed people from claiming more benefits under Universal Credit thanthey were employed by someone  on minimum wage.  Ms Parkin was assessed as being able to work  hours a week, so her MIF was set at more than £ a month - later increased to about £. Her legal team said that one month she earned only £, but was treated asshe had earned the £ MIF. That meant her Universal Credit payment was reduced by £.Legal papers stated thatsheaposd paid her landlord in November , even after her earnings she would have had £. left to pay for a month’s food, travel, bills and council tax.Ms Parkin said she would be better off without a job, as an unemployed person in her position would be entitled to an extra £ a month in benefits. Lawyer Ms Gregory said today: The Minimum Income Floor continues to punish the self-employed who have fluctuating monthly income. It runs completely contrary to the Government’s own stated aims of ‘making work pay’ under Universal Credit. The Courtaposs suggestion that self-employed iniduals can simply make employment their main activity whilst continuing their self-employment on the side is not realistic.

Angharad Carrington-Edmunds and her husband Jack are on a camping trip in Brittany with their baby and toddler. Unable to drive to catch their ferry home, the young family has had to extend their holiday - but have no money to spend and have resorted to rationing food. Theyaposve even had to cancel their four-month old daughteraposs christening on Sunday, as they donapost knowthey will be able to make it back home by then. They still have no idea when they will make it home to Crickhowell, Wales. Their car is stuck in a French garage with their possessions and cash locked inside, Wales Online reports.    On Sunday, the last day of their break, the family had taken a pedalo onto the boating lake at the camping resort. My daughter knocked the bag we had with us and suddenly we heard a little plop, explained Mrs Carrington-Edmunds. We looked over the edge and waited for something to surface. We could see the little bubbles rising. My husband looked at me and just said aposyou know what that was donapost you  That was the car keyapos. What should have been a quick-fix has turned into a nightmare, they say.  They managed to convince Eurocamp to let them stay on at the Demains des Ormes Eurocamp campsite, just outside of Saint-Malo, while they sort out their predicament. On the first evening, they scraped together € to buy a pizza for two-year-old Betsy, while they shared a portion of chips from the campsite restaurant.  They also managed to make one tin of haricot beans last three meals.    Itaposs like being on Iaposm a Celebrity, said Mrs Carrington-Edmunds, a solicitor in Abergavenny . We thought we were being quite brave, going camping in Brittany with a two-year-old and a four-month-old baby, but we had our car and it wasnapost really that far away. They were due to arrive back in Wales on Monday, September , but four days later, they are no closer to home turf. Now, the -year-old mother, who is still breast feeding baby Betsy, says she is at breaking point and was left doing all the leg work  in France.  Realising they were unlikely to make their ferry crossing on Monday, Mrs Carrington-Edmunds spent all of Sunday night on the phone to both the AA, who they had taken car insurance with, and Nationwide, who provided their breakdown and travel insurance. Mrs Carrington-Edmunds said: We realised at midnight, we had no car, all our stuff including money and clothes were locked inside with both of the car seats for the children.  On Monday, Mrs Carrington-Edmunds arranged for a French company to tow her car to a French garage, where it has remained, locked, ever since. Luckily Eurocamp agreed they could stay on, but their season has now closed and all the onsite facilities are being shut down for winter. Mrs Carrington-Edmunds even had to make a three-hour round trip to pick up a hire vehicle to cover them in the interim, so they could at least make a trip to the local supermarket to get some groceries. The family are trying to put on a brave face while they camp out in their caravan in the woods in France, but the stress is getting to them all, including their toddler, Evelyn. They are trying to keep Evelyn entertained by making music instruments out of plastic bottles, but she knows things arenapost right and started wetting herself.

Luke Phillips drove at speeds of mph through a north Hull housing estate as he attempted to avoid being caught by police. The -year-old drove the wrong way down one way streets and ran through a red light where he narrowly avoided hitting a pedestrian.He was caught after abandoning the vehicle and asked officers can I just have a moment to cry eyes out, knowing that he would be heading to prison as he had breached a suspended sentence he received just months earlier, Hull Live reports.Phillip Evans, prosecuting, told Hull Crown Court the high speed chase broke out after officers in an unmarked car spotted Phillips, driving a Renault Megane, cut in front of another vehicle on August .    He said: “They saw the defendant pulling across a vehicle in front of the police car and turning into Arram Grove. The car in which the defendant’s vehicle pulled in front of had to brake. “The officers wanted to stop the Renault Megane in order to give him some advice about his driving, however, the vehicle sped off and engaged in a desperate attempt to avoid the attention of the police car.”Phillips, whose Facebook profile lists his occupation as been a full time f***ing legend, began driving at high speeds through the Orchard Park estate.Mr Evans said: “There the defendant left his vehicle somewhere in the region of Lingcourt on a grass area and sought refuge from at least two members of the public by askingthey would shelter him from the police. Neither were cooperative.    “Fortunately there was an officer in plain clothes in the area who was able to join in the search and tracked the defendant first on the roof of a garage. “When the police eventually caught up with him shortly thereafter he said on arrest ‘can I have a moment to cry my eyes out’.” Phillips, of Clanthorpe, Hull, then told police: I have got a one-year-old. I’m going to prison. I only got the car to make some cash and look what’s happened. He already has five convictions which include handling of stolen goods and criminal damage. In April , he was sentenced for possession of cocaine with the intent to supply, receiving a  month sentence suspended for a year. Judge David Tremberg told Phillips he missed “a golden opportunity” to turn his le around. He said: “You [Phillips] were one of the very few people who appeared before this court facing sentence for a serious charge that was not locked up straight away. “The court entrusted you with a golden opportunity to sort yourself out. That trust sadly was misplaced.” Defence barrister Catherine Kioko-Gilligan told the court that Phillips “lacked consequential thinking” when he committed the offence of dangerous driving.

Rebecca Patterson, from Rushclfe, was only recently engaged when she was diagnosed with tongue cancer in April . For around eight years, Rebecca had a sore spot on her tongue and a white patch in her mouth which never went away. Rebecca, a learning support assistant, was initially diagnosed with oral thrush but she was in so much pain she could barely speak or eat.She then had a biopsy and received the devastating call from a nurse, reports NottinghamshireLive.   Rebecca said: “You can never prepare yourself for hearing the words ‘it’s cancer.’ I sat in the consultant’s room trying to process what was happening thinking am I going to die  Will I lose my tongue  How will le ever be normal again  My world had shattered into a million pieces. I remember saying to the consultant: ‘I can’t have cancer, my le with my fiancé is just beginning.’  I wanted answers to all these questions but didn’t want to hear them. I felt so overwhelmed with dferent emotions. I also kept flitting between feeling physically sick with worry - to relief that I finally had a concrete answer.” After the diagnosis, Rebecca underwent  and a half hours of surgery at the Queenaposs Medical Cente in Nottingham. Surgeons removed the right side of her tongue and then took the skin and an artery from her left arm to build her a new tongue. The team of doctors also removed the right lymph nodes in her neck and two back teeth so the tongue would fit. Rebecca added: “I woke to find my arm bandaged, two drains coming out of my neck, a tracheostomy and a feeding tube.    Whilst recovering in hospital, I went through a lot of ups and downs. I couldn’t speak for a week and could only communicate through writing everything down. My trachea would leak, and I would end up with crusty secretions around my neck, my arm was like a dead weight and I had very restricted movement in my neck. I couldn’t do anything independently and relied on the nurses to wash, dress and move me. I felt trapped inside my own body. My self-esteem was at an all-time low.” Rebecca said she struggled to get back to normal when she was discharged from hospital. She said: “Meal times were hard because I had to eat pureed food, I was breathless, I couldn’t shower easily because of my scars and I needed help to go to the toilet. I wanted to feel like ‘me’ again.” Rebecca is speaking out about coming to terms with le post surgery saying: The cancer ing was always at the forefront of my mind - it was my biggest fear.

And detectives have launched a fresh appeal for information ahead of the th anniversary tomorrow. The terrying blast from the lb of explosives tore through the base of the world’s most respected military band, injuring a further  of the Marines. Lt Col Jase Burcham, , who is still serving in the Royal Marines Band Service, was ft from the explosion. He said yesterday: “I was in a corridor after showering. Outside I could hear trainees on the parade ground playing the Aces High march – exactly when it ended, the bomb exploded. “Glass came flying in and bits of ceiling were falling down. Me and another guy bundled each other towards a bathroom to get away from the blast.  “We were shouting ‘get out, get out’ and we bundled ourselves outside. “My ears were ringing. Everything was grey dust. I saw Colour Sergeant Jay O’Neill, his legs trapped under the collapsed roof. He was sat bolt upright organising the rescue. “Weeks later when we marched in Deal, with spaces left for those who were killed, Jay O’Neill was still in a wheelchair. But as we passed, he got to his feet, helped by the First Sea Lord and Commandant General.” Lt Col Burcham – then a “Musician”, the equivalent rank of Private – added: “One of the guys was blown into a metal locker.  “The door closed and the locker fell on top of him. That’s what saved him – all the rubble fell on top of the locker rather than him. He was badly cut and had a fractured skull. Another guy was rolled up like a ball, stuck. “When they recovered him he was straightened out and he had a femoral bleed. He had to be rolled back up. “He was horribly uncomfortable but it saved him by squeezing pressure on his wound.” Recalling the  killed in the attack in Kent, he added: “The loss never goes. I think of them daily. We are family.”  At the Royal Marines Band HQ in Portsmouth, Hants, there is a memorial to the fallen. It includes a smashed watch worn by bandsman Terry Holland who survived the bombing. The watch stopped at .am, the exact time of the blast on September . Lt Col Burcham’s friend Warrant Officer Ian, , whose surname can’t be revealed, is also still serv­ing and was close to the explosion, surviving with cuts. He recalled: “I was drying myself off after showering when it happened. It was a big eruption and I knew immediately it was a bomb. “We all knew each other very well, [we were] very close friends.  “It’s all as fresh as it was  years ago. It was a needless waste of extremely talented young people. I have wept over the years, we all have.” Asked about the IRA, he said: “I don’t waste my time thinking about them. What’s important is not what happens to you, it’s what you do about it – and we cracked on.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girl 14 sent home school","story":"NewsGirl, , sent home from school six times because her skirt was too shortA male teacher at Cantonian High School in Cardf allegedly told Libby Taylor-Ford: \"I don’t want to be walking upstairs and see what you had for breakfast.\"ShareCommentsByAbbie Wightwick:,  SEP NewsDonna Taylor says her daughter Libby Taylor-Ford was sent home from school six times for her skirt being too short \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Not only were they planning their dream honeymoon, they had also just found out they were pregnant with their first child. But their dream le turned into a nightmare following their first baby scan when Katie was given the heartbreaking news she had bladder cancer. The -year-old from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was delighted to find out she was pregnant in February last year. But after she suffered some bleeding early on in her pregnancy she was sent for an early scan.    Nothing could have prepared her and husband, Tom, for what was to follow. Katie, who owns her own cake business, said: It was very surreal. We were told they could hear a heartbeat, so we knew everything was OK with the pregnancy, which was a massive relief and we were really excited. But then we were called into another room and a senior consultant said there was something amiss with my bladder and that it was probably cancer. My mind just went blank at the beginning, I was just in shock as it was so unexpected. But then practicality just kicked in and we knew we had to get on with things.    The next step was a cystoscopy, which looks inside the bladder, and Katie and Tomaposs fears were confirmed - she did have cancer. The coupleaposs dreams of a sunshine honeymoon in Crete were over and their trip was cancelled. When she was just  weeks pregnant, Katie had to undergo surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible. To make it as safe as possible for her unborn baby, doctors used a special machine that meant she was awake throughout the hour-long operation. Thankfully, doctors managed to remove a chunk of the tumour and the baby was unharmed.    Katie said: When they told us the pregnany was fine, that was an amazing feeling. When they pulled the curtains around my bed, every nurse on the ward had stopped what they were doing to check everything was OK with the baby. Usually, treatment would have started straight away but because of Katieaposs pregnancy that wasnapost an option. So, two months before she was due, the mum-to-be had another cystoscopy, which heartbreakingly revealed there was still some tumour on her bladder. Baby Oscar was induced a week early and was a healthy, bouncing boy.    But for Katie, the battle was far from over. Just days after she and Tom ed home with their baby boy she had to go back into hospital for more surgery and to start her cancer treatment. In January this year, new mum Katie began a six week course of chemotherapy, which was pumped directly into her bladder to reduce the side effects. But she admits, that with a newborn at home, the gruelling treatment was tiring. Katie said: It was tiring and I just wanted to be with Oscar and at home but I was having to go to hospital once a week for treatment.

Stomach-churning photos show the grim reality of le inside the property in Runcorn, Merseyside. A cleaning team lted the lid on how such are cleared and described it as one of the worst cases they had ever seen.Neighbours living next door reported seeing rats jumping in the window and couldnapost even sit out in their garden out of fears over the vermin infestation, the Liverpool Echo reportedGrandparents Stephen Dowd, , and Colette Dowd, , have lived next to this rat-infested home for years and say it has taken a toll on their everyday lives.  Business owners Stephen and Colette said they couldnapost let their grandchildren play outside because they feared rats were on the childrenaposs toys. They added they could not believe the scale of clutter shown to them after they saw the interior of the crumbling home. Our reporter was invited in to see the true scale of the problem by Merseyside House Clearing, who are tasked with cleaning out the mountains of rubbish found inside.The companyaposs owner,  George Mensah , said he has been tasked with gutting properties that are packed to the brim with clutter and described this example as one of the worst cases he had seen in  years.   The first thing noticed was the overwhelming smell of damp, dust and dead vermin. A number of toasters, kettles and electrical items were piled up among the sea of items, as well as decade-old magazines. A thick grime was visible on the walls, fridge and windows as the lace, white curtains had turned black on the windows. Georgeaposs first-hand footage revealed how far the stacked items stretched. A dead rat was also visible on top of the discarded fireplace.  Stephen, who has lived next to the home for  years, said he and his we had previously tried to help the owners. They have made the brave decision to buy the property in the hopes of helping to restore the home to what it used to be. The tenants have since been moved into a temporary house and are on the road to getting another home. Stephen said: “It’s been unbelievable really, we had no idea what we were living next to. We came home off holiday and saw rats running round our garden, then we got in touch with environmental health who came and left rat poison, and then we realised it must have been coming from next door.” Colette, a former member of the armed forces, added: “We didn’t know the extent of it, there was no way of knowing they were living like that. We just kept saying there’s something not right here.    “We’ve been saying you can’t believe that someone could live like that. We’re still in shock, every day you’re finding something more shocking.” During the summer’s heatwave, Stephen said the couple were unable to leave any windows or doors open, for fear of rats and flies, and had to invest in air conditioning supplies. George’s company routinely clean hoarder’s properties, but said it is “rare” you hear form neighbours and communities whose lives are affected. He said: “We are very passionate about our work and are non-judgmental towards the inidual in question. “A lot of clients and their families are embarrassed over the situation, we do a lot of work with mental health organisations, the majority of hoarders tend to be the elderly who live on their own.  “Saying that, hoarding has no preference, no conscience.” He added: “We’ve helped people who collect cigarette butts, people who collect dead cats in shoe boxes. One of the worst ones we found was someone who had a sex dungeon hidden. “You name it, we’ve seen it, everyone has a secret. George said: “Each job you take on, it’s like the person becomes part of you, you grow to love it. It’s like becoming a carer and a whole lot of people who you help you end up becoming friends with.” Stephen and Colette said they “felt sorry” for their neighbours and have called for more help to be given to hoarders. Colette said: “I think there needs to be a special helpline like they [have] for Childline, because people are desperate and they need help.

The ­polished oak floors that wounded ­British soldiers were laid out on. The lawn outside where troops dug trenches to fend off the Nazis and the rose garden at the back, where  corpses were hastily buried in unmarked graves. The horse chestnut tree in the front garden, which saved the le of one British soldier by taking the force of a mortar bomb blast – and still bears the scars. And the cellar where her mother hid her five small children from the horrors of war playing out just metres away – but from where Sophie could hear the injured soldiers’ groans and feel the force of artillery blasts as the Germans edged closer. The Old Vicarage, next to a church in the picturesque village of Oosterbeek, Holland, had been an idyllic family home.But then war broke out and the house was at the centre of one of the biggestdisasters of the Allied fightback – in which Sophie’s mother, Kate, emerged as a hero known as the Angel of Arnhem.This week, exactly  years on, veterans have been ing, welcomed with as much warmth as they were all those years ago. Sophie still remembers the events of that week vividly. Now , she still lives in the Old Vicarage. She says: “I cherish this house and feel privileged to live here. It’s where British men gave their lives to free Europe. I’ve lived with their memories all my le. I think of them all the time.” Of the , men from the st Airborne Division who took part in Operation Market Garden in September , just , would make it out again after a vicious nine-day battle. The rest were killed or taken prisoner.  The plan was for the troops to drop into the town of Arnhem and seize a key bridge on the Rhine, then cling on until an armoured column could arrive and reinforce them. But German resistance was greater than expected and the Battle of Arnhem was the most devastating clash of the war, as portrayed in Richard Attenborough’s epic  film A Bridge Too Far. As they ran out of food and ammo, and ground reinforcements failed to arrive, the remnants of the force found themselves hemmed in on the outskirts of Oosterbeek. Housewe Kate opened her house – just  metres from the front line – as a makesht first aid station. Within days it was packed with  men and she spent her days and nights offering motherly love, plus words of comfort and strength, to the injured and dying British troops who filled every room, even the attic. Sophie recalls feeling at first exhilaration at seeing British paratroopers marching down their street following four years of Nazi occupation.  She says: “We went out and took a long time hugging the soldiers. We all kissed and embraced, and we were so happy, because we were free. “My father, a resistance leader, climbed the church tower and raised a Dutch flag. We thought the war had come to an end. “That was my first memory, that collective feeling of happiness at that moment.” But the mood soon changed... Sophie says: “Mother put us in the cellar, with a nanny. She would come and go. We heard the noise and tremors of the grenades and mortars. We didn’t know what mother was having to deal with. She transmitted a sense of safety, so I never felt fear. She later told me the house was so full of injured soldiers there wasn’t space to walk. And all the time it was being bombarded.  We saw the British just once, when she brought in a shell-shocked soldier named Lionel, as she thought it might help him being with us. He sat with us on the steps. I remember the feel of his jacket and that he gave me a piece of his chocolate.” Kate, meanwhile, was earning her name as an angel, tending to the injured, often frightened, soldiers. One paratrooper is reported to have told her “You’re lovely, just like my mum” moments before he died. General Frank King, cared for by Kate after being shot in the leg, wrote: “I noticed how the whole room brightened up at her arrival and how the soldiers hung on to her every word.” As men died, they were buried in Kate’s garden. Under relentless sniper fire, the young Army doctor in charge was twice wounded. Orderlies were killed moving stretchers and some of the wounded were shot dead as they lay inside the house.  On the ninth day, the British got orders to withdraw and , escaped across the Rhine. Furious at how Oosterbeek had helped the British, the Germans ordered everyone to leave the village. Sophie remembers: “Mother took us out and put a blanket over our heads so we didn’t see the bodies of British soldiers. But a little further down the road the blanket fell off and I saw the bodies of four Germans. It affected me greatly. I pass that spot every day and every day for the rest of my le I’ve thought of them.”  After the war, Kate refused to accept she was a hero. When soldiers clubbed together for a plaque to honour her, she insisted her name be taken off. But in ,  years before her death, she accepted an honorary MBE. Sophie’s younger brother Michiel, , says: “She thought anyone would have done what she did. She would say the real angels were the ones who fell from heaven, the brave men of the Airborne Division.” After Kate, husband Jan and their children ed to the Old Vicarage in , veterans and their relatives began to turn up, to thank her. Tragedy struck in , when her oldest son Pieter was killed by a leftover anti-tank mine by the Rhine. It did not stop Kate honouring the Brits who gave their lives to liberate Holland, making the house and its beautul gardens a living monument to them. In the shade of a cedar tree at the bottom of her garden, she put a statue of Pegasus, the symbol of the British airborne forces.  Kate died in , aged , after a car hit her and Jan outside the Old Vicarage. She was thrown into her garden, dying in the same place as so many soldiers she had cared for. Jan, who broke both knees, was nursed back to health by the same doctor, named Martin, who ran the first aid post during the battle. He flew over from England as soon as he heard of the accident. Since her mother’s death, Sophie has continued to receive British veterans, some of whom have become lelong friends. They include the family of Colonel Freddie Kemp OBE, a survey officer from the st Airlanding Light Regiment who led the troops holed up around the Old Vicarage. His grandson, also named Freddie, , often stays with Sophie at her house.  Freddie said: “Grandpa got to know Kate because he ended up having to bury most of his men in her garden. He told me the house was sniped at all the time. In the end, they had one gun they used to protect the house and keep the Germans away to evacuate. “He swam across the Rhine three times, carrying injured. He became a vicar but never forgot Kate, even naming my mum after her. Our families have been close ever since.” Another visitor was Lionel, the shell-shocked soldier. Sophie says: “In  he arrived in my garden. His grandson had literally dragged him. He said he had nightmares about that cellar and refused to come back.  “I remembered his name, even though I was only five at the time. At that, he burst into tears and fell into my arms. We both cried and I took him to see the cellar again. Later, I received a letter from him. He said that from that moment on his nightmares had stopped. He thanked me for finally giving him peace.” And the gratitude of Oosterbeek has not waned. Airborne Forces flags and Union Jacks hang from houses and shops. Fashion boutiques display clothes and bags with the Pegasus symbol, while a sweet shop sells boxes of Airborne chocolates.

Anouska De Georgiou, , who went to the same school as Kate Middleton, says she was groomed by Epstein after meeting him through well-connected friends in London in the s. Epstein soon started flying her to his properties across the globe including his lair in the Caribbean.In an interview alongside other victims on NBCaposs Dateline Friday, Ms De Georgiou claimed Epstein groomed her before raping her and dozens of others.She said: When Jeffrey would see me he would physically shake because he wanted to get at me and that was very unnerving.    Speaking of how he lured her into his disturbing world, she said: By the time I was being raped, it was too late. Miss de Georgiou had a privileged upbringing, attending the prestigious Marlborough College. She claimed the -year-old - who was found dead in his cell last month - slowly groomed her. It wasnapost zero to  in one day, she explained. It was introduced piecemeal, along with constant emotional, financial reinforcement that this was the path, the only path.

But she felt powerless to help the other girls being abused by the tycoon.  After seeing a girl younger than herself, she said:  I wanted to say something.

Andrew Nino and Kiara Paz, both , and -year-old Alyssa Brianna Vega are charged with first-degree felony aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Austin Police say the pair kicked their way into the family apartment and stole drugs and money at gunpoint. Desire, who was . weeks pregnant and her boyfriend chased after them. She was shot. Medics rushed Desire to hospital where she gave birth to Emery Skye who was placed on le support. Eight days later Emery passed away while being held by her loving mum and dad.  In a heart-wrenching, emotional and powerful account of what happened on that awful night brave Desire has spoken to Mirror about the trauma and loss she is going through and how God is helping her by aposguiding her out of her painapos. apos You will always be my blessing and I’m so hurt that you’re missing from my arms but you’ll never be gone from my heartapos    When I first found out I was pregnant I always wondered who she would become andshe would be healthy and I prayed and hoped to be able to give her a great le. I had a close friend lose her baby very young and the thought always stuck with meI ever lost Emery I would go insane and a part of me would die and I would be sooo lost. I worked the whole way up until a couple days before the incident and I was so excited for the opportunity to be a mother. I felt during those months and even now, that was my God given purpose. She was my inner strength and my motivation. She still is. One night I was at home in my apartment organizing for her arrival and moving things around. I kicked myself out of my only bedroom in the apartment and made my room the living room so I could have room for all her dressers and belongings in the bedroom. Of course the things filled the room and I still had things in the kitchen, living room and dining room areas that were for her as well. That’s how ready and excited my family and I was...    I heard a knock on my door but was never expecting company and when I went to check outside and around the areato see who knocked, I never saw a soul. A few minutes later, I had continued to look through herclothes and separate them by size to wash, when suddenly I heard the door get kicked open. Startled and confused I stayed in the room until I heard a manaposs voice asking where I was. I suddenly crept out the bedroom only to be encountered by a woman with a kne. She quickly grabbed hold of me and I begged and pleaded for her to not stab me that I was pregnant. There in the living room also stood a man in which the voice belonged to holding a gun, pointing it at my boyfriendright at his head. We didn’t know these people, we asked who they were and what they wanted. They came for someone who had problems with the boyfriend.  I begged and pleaded for them to let us be, that they were in MY HOME and that I had nothing to do with whatever they were there for. After a while of being told not to move and to shut up and being threatened to be shot or stabbed, angrily and disappointed they started grabbing our phones, car keys, all my medical cards and WIC card as well as my ID, social, and money I had in my purse that I was saving for an emergency and the money I was saving for baby. They took an Xbox as well since I didn’t have much except baby items in the apartment they tried taking what would be somewhat valuable or important to them. As they began to run out the house I hollered for the boyfriend to follow them and I grabbed a kne and ran out behind him. As soon as I stepped foot out the apartment I started screaming for someone to help me that two people just broke into my apartment with a gun and kne and were taking my things! I continued to run and as I came around the corner I noticed the boyfriend was fighting for my stuff back in which he was somewhat successful and was able to grab a few things back.  Still running I looked back to seehe was okay and then I heard a gunshot. I knew I had been hit because immediately I felt an intense pain spread throughout my stomach. I quickly covered where I felt blood escaping, the backside of my lower right abdomen. The pain in my stomach was too intense for me to walk so I sat in the street holding my wound, praying, yelling for someone to help me I had been shot. The neighbours then surrounded the sidewalks and were startled by gunshot noises and even more so to find me . weeks pregnant shot in the streets. They quickly called the cops and EMS to help. Shortly after the EMS had arrived and were tending to me. Right after the noise of the gunshot I could no longer feel Emery kicking in my stomach and I knew something was wrong. I remember answering questions that were asked and in between constantly asking them to help my baby, to save my baby. In the EMS ride they tried to detect her heartbeat in which they soon found out wasn’t there. They called for an emergency c section an anaesthetist.  Last thing I remember is being rolled into the emergency room with so many eyes on me, I knew it was serious but didn’t know how serious. A few days later I was more aware of things around me. I was then informed I was shot twice once in the left abdomen which exited the backside lower right abdomen in which I was applying pressure once I was shot, and another time in my left breast. The bullet went through my abdomen and nicked some organs and went through my uterus and intestines. I had to have surgery on my intestines and had a lot of internal bleeding and blood loss which was also being treated. They were able to save my intestines and uterus. However, I had also been informed that upon the emergency c section once they delivered Emery she was not breathing and had to be resuscitated. After resuscitating her they realized due to the amount of blood loss and the loss of oxygen to her brain that she was completely brain dead and airlted her to help fight for her le in a hospital that would be able to provide the medical attention she needed. The doctors and nurses in both hospitals were so great, and my family as well as Emery’s dad and his family were there every day through our battles for support. It was a hard time for us all. Nobody had been contacted until the next morning Sunday July st. Everyone was frantic and worried and hurt to find out what happened to me and how Emery had been hurt the most. We were able to FaceTime which kept my motivation to see Emery every day. When I first saw her she was completely motionless and couldn’t open her eyes, cry, or even breathe on her own. They had put her on le support to help make her stronger, however she wasn’t doing too well.  After she arrived to the new hospital that first night, she was having a lot of seizures and they knew there was no hope of her surviving or doing anything on her own. As I was in the hospital I asked for a baptism for Emery. They didn’t expect her to live past that night and I wanted to make sure she would be baptized and saved to go to Heavenshe passed. The ceremony was beautul. I prayed that night before I went to bed, praying for a miracle and for God to give her and I strength to pull through the night, and we did. A few days after my surgery I continued to fight to push my way towards being discharged and being able to go be with Emery. She was fighting as well. My baby girl was so strong and able to push through until Mommy was able to be with her again. I can’t express in many words the joy I felt once I was discharged and allowed to go be with my baby girl.  You can donate to Desireaposs Go Fund Me here I thanked God and still thank God every day for allowing me to have her and for the family to have her over those days which she was here on Earth with us. The doctors didn’t expect her to live another night but she lived for a total of ! When I arrived to her hospital the doctors informed me of how severe her condition was and told me her brain stem was completely dead and that there would be no way she could breathe on her own, cry, crawl, eat, walk, read, write, do anything on her own. Every day I spent with her they reminded me of this condition she was in and the how impossible it would be for her to do anything without the machines. That’s when they told me this is a decision that is ultimately up to me, however when do you finally say that enough is enough and let her rest  My heart was already broken into a million pieces knowing she was hurt and now knowing that I could never do anything to heal her pain or make her better completely demolished my heart. I felt so confused and hurt and angry. I didn’t feel like it was right for me to have to make such a decision to let her go being that I fought so hard and she did too for us to be reunited again and have moments together. I was informed of how the process would be once I made my decision and I was so stubborn. I wanted to do things with her that I would’veshe wasn’t brain dead. I signed a paper for DNR one night but that’s as far as they got me. I was stuck on being able to spend time with her just as the family was able to while I was in my hospital recovering. I appreciated the nurses they were so loving and understanding and allowed me to stay in the hospital so that I could be with her as much and as long as I wanted to.  I loved touch times the most and made sure to never miss one. Those were the times I was able to do those things with her: bathe her, change her diaper, take her temperature, and weigh her. After a few days and talking to a few more doctors I realized they were right. As much as I wanted to keep her this wasn’t the le I wanted her to have.... Mommy would’ve loved to take care of her evenshe was  with tubes and couldn’t do anything for herself. However what one doctor told me stuck with me: this is a decision you make out of love. My love for her was soooo strong and deep and as much as it killed me not having her and seeing her with all the tubes and motionless, I knew I should let her go and be free and not continue to suffer. I prayed to God every day and every night for strength and guidance and forgiveness and to watch over my baby girl. On the th of July we decided it was time to put our love for her in front of all  we were feeling or wanting and gave the doctor permission to take her off the tubes. I was allowed to hold her in my arms the entire time and have whoever I wanted in there. When they first took off the tubes her father and I and our parents were in the room.  Once they took off the tubes, they warned us that she may be able to breathe for a little bit or a few days given that her body was getting used to the machine. I prayed and prayed for her to be able to breathe on her own for a little while so we could all see her without her tubes. Once they removed the tubes, she continued to breathe! A miracle. What a long way my baby had come from that first night when they said there was no hope. I asked for the rest of the family to join us in the room so we could all love and support her and watch her fight and see how beautul she was without the tubes... I still held her through each breath she took. The more she took on her own the more you could tell she was fighting to take those breaths. We loved her dearly and knew she was strong but baby girl you don’t have to continue to fight to be with God and rest. She had already fought long and hard enough and didn’t need to prove to any of us family members how strong she was because she showed us that strength when she continued to live despite the doctorsapos words. She was breathing on her own for  min. The same time Mama had spent bleeding out after being shotand we praised God for allowing her to do that on her own. So many thoughts and emotions filled our heads after seeing her breathe on her own. We wanted to so badly put her back on the machine but once you decide, you decide.  She went peacefully in my arms that day and with the love and support of her immediate family surrounded by her as well as the grace of God. It looked asshe passed in her sleep and oh how peacefully she went and looked as her body started to fade to purple. I was at a complete loss for words. I never thought I’d be torn of my daughter before her due date. I never thought I’d have to experience such trauma nor loss. I wanted to cremate her to have her with me everywhere I go. However, we were informed that in order to do that the medical examiner would have to keep her body and it would take up to  months for us to have it back for services and then cremation. I was devastated. I felt like my work was falling down all around me and as I fell apart I had to remain strong. It hurt me to think that I would have to endure such trauma and then lose my first born daughter and also bury her! Hi, I am Emery Skye. I was born . weeks early because two people broke into my mommies apartment and robbed her.I’m not sure why they did that. Don’t they know she was getting everything set up for me to come home soon They shot her, the bullet almost hit me. Thankfully the EMS got there quickly. My mommy survived. She has lots and lots of staples on her tummy. Thanks to St. David’s Hospital I lived too.I heard my mommy and grandma say how perfect I am. But every time the doctor comes in I can hear my mommy cry.He says my brain has no activity. Something about the bullet caused my brain to have no oxygen.They say I will never be able to open my eyes or do anything at all. I’m sorry mommy, I really am trying.I don’t know why those people did this to us. Why they’d hurt me or my mommy. But today a man named Jesus told me he was going to make me all better, said I would be one of his angels.I would be able to watch over my mommy and my entire family. Iaposm so excited. I am never going to leave my mommy’s side. I can see now, I see my mommy. She is so beautul but she is crying, everyone is crying. I can see a baby in a white dress. I think she’s sleeping. Oh... I think she’s me."},{"url":null,"title":"angolan minesweepers living proof britains","story":"NewsAngolan minesweepers are living proof why Britains foreign aid is so importantEXCLUSIVE: The Mirror meets brave African men and women still cleaning up deadly remnants of bloody civil war - and finds out why theyre so grateful to usShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsA female de-miner works in a minefield close to the village of Tepa - thanks to much-needed British foreign aid \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Along the side of the track, mothers with babies on their backs and bowls on their heads, and men clutching primitive hoes form an impromptu line of honour, bowing and clapping, their lined faces oozing gratitude. Beyond the clearing is a field where cassava grows, the crop these people from the nearby village of Tepa need to take from the ground to stay alive. They take it every day, but at colossal risk, because that ground, like vast swathes of rural Angola, is peppered with landmines, the legacy of the -year Angolan Civil War, one of the bloodiest conflicts of the last century.  That is why the nine-strong mine team make that dawn march into the field, after East German and South African mines were found embedded in the soil, and why the people of Tepa are so indebted to them. And to you. Because, written large on the front of the de-miners’ visors are the words: “UK Aid... from the British people.” Aid channelled via the Manchester-based Mines Advisory Group, which has a -strong team in Angola, clearing almost a million square metres of minefields every year. A woman here has a Union Jack on her T-shirt. I say I’m from Britain and she grabs my hand and says “muito obrigado”, Portuguese for “thank you very much”. I’ve always been pleased to pay my tax but at .am as the sun rises in the remote Angolan province of Moxico I’ve rarely felt more proud to do so. Because that woman was echoing what chieftains of villages that are now coming back to le due to landmine clearances paid for partly by our money, had been telling me in the previous days. That without our help, they would have no le.  Here is the much-demonised foreign aid in action and far from looking like an unnecessary drain on the British taxpayer, it looked like money well spent. Landmines, which in  alone claimed , lives worldwide, are killing or maiming someone, mostly children, every single hour. But our aid is a fraction of what is needed to achieve the goal of making the world landmine-free by . Prince Harry will travel next week to the Angolan city his mother Diana visited months before her death in , to alert the world to the need to finish the job. It is a big one. After gaining independence from Portugal in , Angola slipped into a conflict between two former liberation movements which became a proxy war for the Cold War powers. It was a war with no front line, and both sides laid their deadly mines to try to wipe out each other. The people got caught in the middle with half a million of them killed, as Angola became the most heavily mined nation on Earth. Millions fled the West African country.  A land that had been self-sufficient in all major food crops and an exporter of others was left economically decimated when the war ended in . There was a . million ton shortfall in maize last year. Nearly a third of children are stunted, largely due to poor nutrition. Le is a daily struggle. But thanks to the aid Britain, the US and Japan are giving to organisations like MAGcommunities are coming back to le. In Tepa, the Sobadressed in a leopard skin hat and robe tells me that two years ago there were only five families in his village. Now there are  families, with people ing from Zambia and the Congo on hearing the landmines were gone.  The Soba is effusive in his gratitude: “My people used to live in fear but not now they have safe access to work and school. They can live again. I’d like to say thank you to the kind British people for giving us a helping hand that can save us from losing our legs.” A few miles away in Lundjacute, the women and girls greet us with a tribal song, the words have been changed to say thank you to MAG and the British people. The Soba tells us he ed there in  with just his two wives. His people began to follow in small numbers but by  there had been three deaths because of mines, and they were thinking of leaving. MAG stepped in and cleared it. Now there are  families and  children. At the start of school every day they make the kids give thanks to Britain.  In  the village of Luzi had just  people living there. Thanks to MAG clearing four minefields around the village it now has a population of ,, plus a clinic, five boreholes, a school, three churches and  shops. Hundreds of mines were found in Luathamba in , and the government told the people to leave.

There were no survivors. An inquest into the hikersapos deaths noted oneaposs tongue was missing, anotheraposs clothes were aposradioactiveapos and one man had bitten off his own finger. Tents were slashed from the inside and most of the bodies were found partially naked. In  years, nobody has been prosecuted and theories have ranged from yetis, missile testing, territorial indigenous tribes, storms and mass hysteria. The coroner, under the guidance of the Soviet Union, eventually attributed the mysterious deaths to aposhypothermiaapos. But now, with advances in forensic technology and compelling new insights, could this mysterious old case finally be solved for good  Together with journalists from Ruptly, a leading forensic expert, and local guides,invites you to review this ground-breaking video investigation. Decide for yourself - was it hypothermia or something far more sinister  The crime scene and the victims  Igor Dyatlov was expected to send a telegram to his sports club from the Urals no later than February  about the groups progress but no such message was received. After families became concerned for the groupaposs welfare, a rescue mission was launched with army and militsiya forces searching the area by plane and helicopter. On February  , searchers stumbled upon badly damaged tents, which had been torn down the middle from the inside. Footprints were found at the scene, though bizarrely not in complete sets. Some could have been made with bare feet.  The bodies of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko were soon found. They were shoeless and dressed only in underwear. Branches on a nearby tree were broken, suggesting one member of the group had climbed up to look out for something. Searchers later found three more bodies: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin. Finding the remaining members took more than two months. Three of the four were discovered more dressed than others. Dubinina was wearing Krivonishenkoaposs burned, torn trousers and her left foot and shin were wrapped in a torn jacket. New forensic findings show aposdefensive woundsapos  One expert delved deeper into some of the injuries found on the bodies of the hikers to establishthey could have been inflicted by a person. This video retraces the steps of the group. First it shows a number of dummies designed to aid coroners and forensic experts by demonstrating how wounds are inflicted - particularly how a certain movement could result in a certain type of injury. Eduard Tumanov, Doctor of forensics at Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, said: “The injuries described in the Dyatlov forensic medical report are identical to the ones represented here on these dummies, which gives use reason to assume that these injuries could be received in self defence.”  “Dyatlov. He has small grazes on his face, the protruding parts of his face, which allows us to suppose that they could have been caused by him falling face first in the snow. “These abrasions happened because his legs were tied together with something. They were either handcuffed or shackled, or bound with some sort of rope, because, in the cold, rope freezes up and becomes fairly solid. “There is a very interesting note in the forensic medical report: there are red-brown coloured grazes and indentations around the front, side and rear surfaces of both ankles. “It’s interesting that he has abrasions on his metacarpophalangeal joints, which are here. What does this mean  He hit his hands against something or someone. Judging by everything, there was a fight.”  aposThere was no explosion or avalancheapos Doctor Eduard Tumanov says: So they light a fire and take their clothes off to dry them, at which point something or someone terries them and they start to climb up the cedar tree, because they have injuries consistent with climbing up a tree trunk. Straight away we can rule out death by avalanche, explosion, we can rule out chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, electromagnetic weapons, etc. The theory that animals attacked, bears, wolverines, etc...there are no injuries consistent with an animal attack. Judging by the chaotic nature of the injuries, iety, would suggest that there was not one single object that would have caused these injuries to everyone. In summary, one could assert that someone attacked them, someone without a firearm, or at least they didn’t use it, without a kne, or they didn’t use it, all the injuries were caused exclusively by hard, blunt objects. They were probably inflicted by a human hand. Unpacking one skieraposs chilling aposmessageapos  Former Editor-in-Chief of Russiaaposs Pravda, formerly the communist party of the Soviet Union paper, has also expressed doubt of any kind of aposmissile testingapos but he does believe the incident was apospre-plannedapos. Vladimir Sungorkin said: When one of the most mysterious characters, the most mysterious person in the group called Zolotarev got on the train, he was accompanied by a big group of students and he said ‘We are going on such an unusual hike that we’ll be renowned afterwards.’ We have no explanation for this, it’s absurd. Why would you become famous just going hiking  One could theorise that they were conducting some sort of experiments with drugs, adaptogens, performance enhancing drugs. Maybe for the military, the KGB, or cosmonauts. Maybe, having taken this medicine, unknown to us, they could lose their minds and kill each other in all these dferent ways. While this theory is speculative, it could help to make sense of the radio activity at the scene and why nothing known to medical experts showed up on the toxicology report. When askedhe thought they had been testing missiles, he said: So a rocket went off course, whataposs next  They say that there was a missile testing range here. This is absurd. What is a testing range  It is a specially-equipped site.  He continued: There are devices there, there is surveillance. Everything is cordoned off. And these mountains were climbed by five groups of tourists. It is a popular place, because the mountains are bare and beautul, and the taiga is also beautul. There were five groups of tourists there. And they all went through Ushma. On visiting the pass sixty years on he noticed some key unusual points. They climbed up the cedar. They’re all scratched up. One of them has a piece of finger they’ve bitten off in their mouth. It remained in his mouth, he bit his finger off. So he died, it’s clear he bit his finger off because he was in agony, otherwise, why  would you bite your own finger off  He died there as a result of this pain. When they analysed burns on his leg, they once thought that he fell and was burnt, but the burn did not show this. The person was either hung above the fire or they took a log from the fire and burned him on the cedar from below. Can you imagine this  It’s unusual to say the least. The missing clothing and ruling out a Mansi killing   As theories fly, there is one worth mentioning. As all of the hikers were found in barely any clothing, it is possible they could have simply succumbed to hypothermia. One symptom of this is known as aposparadoxical undressingapos, when a person is in the final stages of hypothermia they believe they are boiling and undress despite the freezing conditions. What this does not explain is why the hikers ran from their tents, down the mountain and into the trees. One theory that has haunted local people is that aposthe Mansiapos - a local indigenous tribe - could have been behind the killing. But speaking to Ruptlyaposs Russian correspondent, one Mansi guide said it couldnapost have been his people behind the shocking deaths. He said: They [the Mansi] only come here in the summer, at the end of May to hunt deer. When the snow falls, they go to the forest. Since the death of the hikers, the Mansi have nicknamed Dyatlov passaposKholat Syakhlapos or aposthe Deadly Mountainapos.

It’s sad to see people that are doing full-time jobs that are still struggling with bills.”Samantha Bruce runs the Food For Thought service in Charleston and recently helped launch the Lochee Community Larder.The service has been open for seven weeks with Sam saying they have handed out roughly  bags in that time.She said: “It’s been busy, I knew it was going to be.“We did know how much of a need there was and that was why we opened up the larder in Lochee.”Edna Molloy, , from Ardler, uses both Kirkton’s larder and the service in Lochee because she is unable to work because of epilepsy.She said both initiatives helped her cut down her £ food bill.Morgan Gray, , from Lochee, also attends both services.She said: “It’s great.

I thought we worked our socks off and thoroughly deserved the victory.”McGhee added: “After the two defeats, everyone could have felt down but the dressing-room was positive and that was a big three points for us.“We know in-house how good we are and how good players we are. We all believe in the gaffer’s philosophy and we knew it would come good but we need to kick on now.“We knew it would turn around with the quality we have in the dressing-room. We bounced back against Alloa and showed our character – I’m delighted for the boys.”McGhee found the net four times last season for Falkirk as they battled unsuccessfully against relegation from the Championship.With the Bairns, however, McGhee was expected to get forward much more, often being used as a right full-back rather than a central defender.A change in position hasn’t changed his aspirations of “chipping in with goals” throughout the rest of the campaign for the Dark Blues, though, as he targets a much loftier ambition of promotion to the top flight at Dens Park.Against Alloa, the -year-old was in the right place at the right time to turn home winger Josh McPake’s centre in the th minute, finishing inside the six-yard box to give his new side victory.He added: “It was just a bit of striker’s instinct! I saw Josh going past the full-back so I just got across their centre-half and directed it in.“I was absolutely delighted. I got a few goals last season at Falkirk but you don’t get forward as much playing centre-back as you do at right-back.“I have always chipped in with goals over the seasons and, hopefully, I can do the same this year.”Last season with Falkirk proved just how dficult a league the Championship is with the Bairns’ shocking descent to League One after a dreadful campaign.After moving back to Scottish football following a spell with Middlesbrough, McGhee admits it was tough at Falkirk as they went from promotion nearly-men to the relegation trapdoor.He said: “I have played in the league for two years now and anyone can beat anyone.“It is a lot dferent from the Premiership where the big two are going to take points off everyone. But in the Championship everyone takes points off each other. It is just the fact that who maintains the performance levels and wins more games will win the league.”He added: “Itcan set you up for a fall sometimes. It can be dficult as you can get praised too much and then you end up with a defeat.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7613752bf284.15340185.jpg ","title":"dundee united need to get off to quick start against arbroath says defender smith","story":"Defender Liam Smith knows Dundee United must get off to a fast start against Arbroath on Saturdaythey are to bounce back to form.United started last weekend’s - defeat at Ayr United sluggishly and the full-back insists they need to make sure they perform for  minutes when the Red Lichties come calling at Tannadice.The loss at Somerset Park saw The Honest Men rise up to join the Tangerines at the top of the Championship pile.With both now sitting on  points, United know they blew a chance to open up a gap to Ayr and others at the second-tier summit.However, the -year-old former Hearts and Ayr man hopes they can take a second bite at that cherry and stay top with victory on Saturday.“The first-half performance was nowhere near good enough,” Smith said.“Second half we were better. If we want to win a league we have to perform as we did in the second half but for  minutes.“We know it’s going to be a hard league. We’re sitting at the top of it. If we’d lost the first game of the season and won our next four the atmosphere would be dferent and the questions would be dferent.“We hope to stay at the top. We’ve had a wee dip but, over the course of a season, there will be more dips like this. We have to make sure we beat Arbroath on Saturday.”Going back to his former stomping ground on the Ayrshire coast, Smith knew he and another ex-Ayr man Lawrence Shankland were going to be under the spotlight wearing tangerine.He accepts they didn’t perform and makes no excuses for himself or anyone  at the Terrors, who know all about the threat and quality of The Honest Men.United lost both of their visits there last season when Smith and Shankland were among the Somerset tormentors-in-chief.Smith added: “From first-hand experience I know Ayr’s philosophy going into every game, particularly playing against Dundee United, who they did well against last season.“They would have been keen to keep that going. Me, Shanks and the other boys knew that they have a squad of good players.“Fair play to them but we didn’t do enough. We didn’t compete and put our stamp on the game. We didn’t deserve to take anything.”Right-back Smith accepts they can’t expect to win every game this season but believes it was the performance which angered those connected with United most.Ayr controlled proceedings for most of the  minutes and Smith believes they can only look at themselves as they seek to get back to winning ways in their quest for promotion.“You can’t win every game but the manner in which we lost was not acceptable,” he said.“We didn’t turn up and Ayr took advantage. They are a good side and we can’t afford to take our foot off the gas at any point.“The second half was better. In the first half, we were outworked, which can’t happen.“First and foremost, we need to look at ourselves.“I don’t think we passed the ball enough, which is what we’ve been doing for the first four games. We’ll pick ourselves up and see what we need to improve.”Smith was involved in the concession of both the goals at Ayr last weekend and has held his hands up for his involvement in Daniel Harvie’s opener and Alan Forrest’s penalty which sealed the points.“They were both straight balls,” he reflected. “The second goal, I’ve given away the penalty so I need to hold my hands up for that. No complaints.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d820bcc130e61.72848189.jpg ","title":"in form keeper hamilton impresses mcpake after strong display for dundee against alloa","story":"Dundee boss James McPake hailed the influence of his No  Jack Hamilton for taking the pressure off his defence when it was needed against Alloa.After saving a second-half penalty with the score at -

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

We have to look at new ways of improving our public spaces, for the benefit of all, including our wildle.Councillor Stuart Bellsaid he welcomed the introduction of bioersity but warned that the council must be wary of making changes simply to save money.He added: ldquoIrsquove seen the introduction of bioersity areas in other parts of the Borders and these do need on-going and specialist care and attention or they just become an unsightly mess of weeds.I trust that the councilrsquos neighbourhood services team have the skills to manage the changes."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is a bonded pair of rabbits called Mfy and Boo.The charity told us: \"Mfy is a seven-year-old neutered brown girl and Boo is a two-year-old black and white boy.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

with standard amenities like running water and toilets you can use.ldquoNow the council has invested in getting the roof watertight it is time to get the electrics and water sorted.Mr Adams said the building was used throughout the year and they were keen to make it ldquoa more pleasant working environment.He has already met with East Lothian Council and acknowledged funds were tight.He said: ldquoWe are appreciative we have got a watertight building.ldquoWe just need to get it as a good working environment and secure it long-term.ldquoWe are working by head torches and tripods and we should be working with normal lights.ldquoEverybody appreciates that the Christmas lights bring a lot of people into Dunbar.Concerns have repeatedly been expressed about the future of the historic building, which was once home to one of Dunbarrsquos earliest cinemas, and was used as a venue for public meetings.A report in  suggested pound, needed to be spent in remedial works and two years later Herbert Coutts, of the community council, suggested it would be ldquobest-served being demolished.Plans to breathe new le into the building and turn it into ldquoa multi-al community space stalled, despite Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh and comedian and radio presenter Fred MacAulay backing the campaign.Mr Adams has written to Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, regarding funding for the building.He stressed the work at the venue would not be on a par with the previous plans to bring it back to le but would simply improve it and make it into a storage area or workshop.A spokesman for East Lothian Council confirmed an application for pound, had been considered by the area partnership, with the Christmas Lights group given pound, last year."},{"url":null,"title":"micropub-looks-extend-drinking-hours-pub-39-s-garden","story":"Visitors to Station Yard Micropub, beside Dunbar Railway Station, can enjoy a drink outdoors until pm.But

Similar ventures are in operation at other senior football clubs in Scotland. These rough arenas offered respite from a grimy and perilous working week and the echoes of precious hours spent in them can defer the thickening mists of dementia.The football players and the clubs whose colours they wore carried the pride of entire working class communities: no one owned them on these terraces and the princes and magicians they came to watch were neighbours or the sons of neighbours.Few of these grounds now exist in their original state and even fewer that are as old as Cltonhill. Albion Rovers have existed since , the last  of this stretch in this place. A collection of black and white photographs taken of Cltonhill and the supporters who bring it to le every two weeks forms the centrepiece of an exhibition at Coatbridgersquos splendid Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Le to mark Albion Roversrsquo residency at the stadium.A Game of Two Halves features the mesmeric and evocative work of the award-winning photographer, Iain McLean who was reared on the streets that surround this little park and who re-discovered his childhood love for the club while making them. McLean uses the shting light of grey skies to capture the simple act of attending a football match and to make them seem timeless. Some of these images could have been taken  or  years ago and capture the enduring simplicity of footballrsquos appeal. His pictures are accompanied by a short film by the documentary-maker Wilma Smith, who spent an afternoon recording the ebb and flow of a game through the terracing shouts of the supporters.Albion Rovers is a club whose name suggests inclusivity and where all that is tribal must depart. Other clubs across the UK have lsquoAlbionrsquo or lsquoRoversrsquo attached to their place-names but none have both together. Nor is there any such thing as a lsquoWanderers Unitedrsquo and so Albion Rovers is something unique in British senior football: its name is not narrowed by geographical boundary or city limits, yet few other clubs are embedded in the community that formed them more than this one.Every picture in McLeanrsquos Cltonhill portfolio tells a story that built this year towards something unforeseen and operatic. Towards the end of season   Albion Roversrsquo faced the biggest existential threat of its -year existence as it performed a danse macabre for its tormented supporters with the spectre of relegation from League Two. It escaped this fate with the assistance of a benign intervention as the careless whish of an administratorrsquos pen and the improper registration of an opposition player bequeathed the club three unlikely points and an advantage that was to prove priceless.Ronnie Boyd who, until recently, was Albion Rovers chairman recalls this uncertainty with a chill. ldquoItrsquos vital for Coatbridge that Albion Rovers retains its senior status. If we had dropped down into the leagues below it wouldnrsquot have been the end of us but it would have dealt a serious blow to our confidence and to the sense of pride that the community retains for this club.Rovers attract a mere  or so supporters at home games and keeping the lights on and the wolves from the door is a week-to-week challenge. ldquoThe club is run on a firm financial footing, says Boyd ldquobut nor are we carrying any padding. We are never more than something like a floodlight failure away from a financial crisis and must rely on the services of a team of volunteers who donate several hours each week to the cause of keeping this club afloat and among Scotlandrsquos senior leagues. Them and our sponsors who also go above and beyond.ldquoMany people in Coatbridge refer to us as their lsquosecond clubrsquo which causes some angst amongst the board. The eternal challenge, I suppose, is to persuade some of them to make us their lsquofirstrsquo club. I donrsquot really resent this. There are many competing attractions and lots of other small clubs find themselves in our position. Yet, the task the club faces in this is much more daunting than most other small, community clubs which strive for the right to co-exist with giants. Four Scottish Premier League clubs lie within a dozen miles of Coatbridge, including the two biggest of all: Celtic and Rangers. Celtic Park lies less than nine miles away and each week coachloads of its supporters leave the town which is still steeped in its Irish Catholic heritage.Occasionally, when a sparsely-populated terrace is captured on camera a wise-cracking, metropolitan commentator will smirk about naming the crowd as well as the teams. There are  season-ticket holders at Cltonhill and Ronnie Boyd reckons he could probably name them all. Part of this is also due to the fact that Coatbridge possesses family roots that run through several generations and that this is one of those neighbourhoods where no one can remain a stranger for long. But itrsquos also due to this being one of the few senior football grounds where the chairman and his board are often to be seen personally greeting supporters at the entrance and thanking them for their continued support at a time when the directors of other clubs are obsequiously dispensing sauvignon to small tycoons.Along the M, meanwhile, Rangers, who were put into liquidation in  for over-reaching itself faced criticism from its own supporters for charging stf prices for their games in the Europa League. Celtic, the richest sporting organisation in Scotland, couldnrsquot bring itself to pay its lowest-paid workers the National Living Wage and when it was shamed into doing so the directors first removed the annual staff bonuses. Yet here is Albion Rovers, their poorest and most humble cousins treating its own few supporters like royalty. This seems to be appreciated and theythe love with interest. One of Iain MacLeanrsquos most vivid images is of volunteers fighting a losing battle trying to sweep mounds of snow from Cltonhillrsquos playing surface for a Scottish Cup tie against St Johnstone in January last year.McLean said: ldquoWhen the St Johnstone fans turned up and realised there was a risk to the game they got on the pitch with the rest of us to clear the snow. The spirit of this place is infectious and gets under your finger-nails. In my recent experience any who turn up here for the first time are captivated and form a deep attachment to Albion Rovers and to Cltonhill.Another is taken during a particularly dispiriting - home defeat to Peterhead last year. On the condensation of a Perspex home dugout a supporter has written in perfect mirror text ldquoSCORE PLEASE, a polite request which where might have been a profane demand.At the start of this season Bury FC, twice winners of Englandrsquos FA Cup and a founder member of the English football league shut its doors after  years of existence. The faces of three generations of its supporters were crumpled in grief as they began to realise that the pride of their northern, working class community was being thrown out of a league they had helped form. Not far away from Bury is Bolton Wanderers, the club of mighty Nat Lofthouse, the Lion of Vienna and which remains locked in a mortal struggle for its own existence. Financial analysts have predicted that several other English Football clubs are just one more breached overdraft away from perdition. These clubs are also hemmed in by an assortment of the richest football teams in Europe but not a scrap from the tables of these most egregiously capitalist enterprises is permitted to nourish its distressed old neighbours. Albion Rovers meanwhile is kept alive by the endeavours by a small volunteer corps of fans and directors who provide graft and services for free. The stadium sponsor is local firm Reigart Demolition and a flotilla of other sponsors gathers each season to ensure that the bills are paid and the part-time players and coaching staff receive some form of remuneration.Albion Rovers may now be eking out a twilight existence but without dreams football is reduced and this old club still retains some of its own. In  they reached the Scottish Cup final before being defeated by Kilmarnock in a - classic in front of , spectators at Hampden. Cltonhillrsquos record attendance of , against Rangers in  will stand for all time.This was where Jock Stein, the greatest club manager in Britain, played for a few years in the early s. In the last few years the club has established a Hall of Fame that now has seven members, including Tony Green who left Coatbridge in  to join Blackpool for pound,. Green also adorns Blackpoolrsquos Hall of Fame as well as Newcastle Unitedrsquos.More recently, in the mid-s Bernie Slaven left to join Middlesbrough where he too became a household name. Despite scoring more than  goals for Albion Rovers all the top Scottish clubs disdained him for his humble surroundings and were subsequently made to look foolish.Turning up occasional pearls such as these and selling them on to larger Scottish and English outfits traditionally provided sustenance to prudently-run smaller clubs. Now, the big clubs have lsquoacademiesrsquo which they use like footballrsquos equivalent of a scallop dredger, trawling the old feeding grounds and sparking dreams in hundreds of working class households before tossing the overwhelming majority overboard in the years to come in the worldrsquos most ruthless pruning exercise. By then, many are ruined by the brief excess of their associations with the big clubs, a time during which they could have developed better habits at clubs like Albion Rovers.Ronnie Boyd says the current board of directors are determined to ensure that they never again risk being demoted to the lower leagues and is hoping that the exhibition at the Summerlee Museum will renew local interest. Next weekend, between September  and September , the museum will host a Celebrate Albion Rovers weekend to commemorate  years of the club at Cltonhill.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10438314.jpg?type=article-full","title":"full-list-climate-strikes-taking-place-across-scotland","story":"It is part of a global movement, inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunbergrsquos school strikes outside the Swedish parliament, calling on politicians and business leaders to take urgent action to curb greenhouse gas emissions.:Demand for post-Brexit environment protection laws as Scots show support in pollThe latest strikes come ahead of a climate action summit in New York convened by UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres to urge countries to up their climate efforts.Fridays front page of The Herald#tomorrowspaperstoday#scotpapers pic jmDmEZMNfThe UK Student Climate Networksays more than  events are taking place across the UK, with ndash for the first time ndash adults being encouraged to join the youngsters as they strike.Global Climate Strike -th of September: events in  countries on all continents.And counting...Everyone is welcome.Everyone is needed.Find your closest strike or register your own at https:t.co ikOafwrNSkSpread the word!#FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike pic ekrmeUxUKSCN is calling on politicians to bring in a ldquoGreen New Deal to cut the UKrsquos emissions to zero and improve lives, changes to education to equip youngsters to deal with the climate crisis and votes at  to give them a voice.These are the climate strikes that we are aware of so far.ABERDEEENam Marischal CollegeABOYNEam Aboyne GreenAVIEMORE:am The HubCRIEFFam James SquareDUNDEEam City SquareEDINBURGHam Middle Meadow WalkELGINam Council OfficeFORRESam Tolbooth  St Leonards Church, High StFORT WILLIAM.am Cameron SquareGLASGOWam Kelvingrove Park BridgeGLASGOWChildrenrsquos Assemblypm ndash pm Glasgow City ChambersINVERNESS:am Falcon SquareIONAam Baile Mor Village CentreKIRKCUDBRIGHT:am Harbour SquareLIVINGSTONam Civic SquareLOCHGILPHEADam Front GreenNAIRNam Highland Council officesOBAN:am Station SquarePERTH:am Bike StationSHETLANDpm Market Cross, LerwickSKELMORIEam Toward ViewST ANDREWSam St Salvatorrsquos QuadSTIRLINGam Pitt TerraceULLAPOOL:am Ullapool Primary School"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-loyalist-band-refuses-withdraw-marches-council-regret-disruption","story":"The Pride of Govan Flute Bands event, which is set to attract up to  marchers, will go ahead despite council officials asking organisers to call the parade off.The march is one of four loyalist parades taking place throughout the city on Saturday, which will go ahead after an announcement by the council that a public processions committee would not take place.Bosses at the council now say, in thecase ofthe Pride of Govan Flute Band, this is because police warned there could be serious disorderthe procession is prevented.:Four loyalist marches get Glasgow City Council go-ahead this weekendHowever, the force also said they would be able to police it either way.Last week, a decision was taken to prohibit all parades through the city over the weekend, with six loyalist and republicans events not held.However, loyalist and protestant groups gathered for a protest at George Square, claiming the move was illegal.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council has now said they were put in an impossible position.He added: \"The council has been placed in an impossible position in relation to the parade in Govan.ldquoPoliceScotlandhas said that, should the procession not go ahead, many of the  people due to take part will react angrily - which could lead to violence and a signicant impact on the local community.ldquoWe deeply regret that the wider community in Govan will be subject to this disruption.

This guaranteed the right of Scotlandrsquos Catholic population to have their children educated by the state according to the norms and mores of their faith. The Act wasnrsquot an endorsement of religious indoctrination it didnrsquot grant a licence for sectarianism. It was simply an acknowledgment of the important role that faith plays in the lives of many of its citizens. Following the harrowing experiences of the Great War it was also an acknowledgement by the state that Catholic children, ravaged by high levels of malnutrition and the effects of multi-deprivation, might be needed to fight any future existential threat to our freedoms and democracy.For more than a century now Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools have flourished and are regularly found to have excelled, under strict inspection, beyond the boundaries of their initial remit. Over several decades when the influx of Irish-Catholic refugees fleeing the Great Famine risked inflaming tensions with the indigenous Protestant working classes the existence of these schools has helped in the process of peaceful integration. They act as bridges where the old and cherished beliefs of a religious minority can meet and converse with the greater Scotland beyond. In disadvantaged neighbourhoods they continue to perform heroically and offer children in these places hope and a slender chance of a rewarding le. Scotland should be proud of them. And we Scots of Irish-Catholic stock should be proud too that we live in a country which cherishes dference and ersity and values our communityrsquos distinctive contribution to its public le.Nicola Sturgeon recognised this last year at a celebration to mark  years of Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools. She said: ldquo is the centenary of the legislation that brought Roman Catholic schools into Scotlandrsquos state education system. In that time, Catholic schools have made a tremendous contribution to Scottish education, and this is something we want to see continue. We value the contribution that Catholic schools make to modern Scotland. We want that contribution to continue in the years ahead.One year on from the First Ministerrsquos eloquent endorsement attacks on Catholic schools remain predictably depressing. The most recent follow skirmishes in Glasgow earlier this month when an Irish republican parade was confronted by protesters. Predictably, this was portrayed as another outbreak of religious sectarianism. Yet, it probably owed more to the current heightened tensions surrounding the prospect of a hard Brexit, the Irish border and inflamed British nationalism. In a remarkably ignorant and badly-written article a former deputy chief constable in Police Scotland used this isolated and rare occurrence to justy shutting Catholic schools. ldquoWe also need to look at the roots of the problem and question what ides us, he wrote. ldquoAndwe do that then we simply cannot escape questioning our system of religiously segregated education. His words were a sinister reminder of why large sections of the Irish-Catholic community traditionally beheld Scotlandrsquos police forces with deep mistrust.The independent Advisory Committee on Tackling Sectarianism set up by the Scottish Government has produced several wide-ranging and exhaustive reports. These specically and unequivocally stated that Catholic schools were not even remotely a cause of sectarianism in Scotland. It also pointed out that, in any case, sectarianism was largely in retreat in modern Scotland.So, in the absence of any evidence that Catholic schools contribute to sectarianism and in spite of counter-data that they actually foster multi-culturalism and tolerance what lies at the root of these attacks  Letrsquos speak frankly here. The people who are most vocerous in their hostility towards Catholic schools also purport to cherish ersity and equality. Yet they want these only within the bounds of a narrow and illiberal agenda. It is group-think that relies on old and discredited tropes that were once used to alienate and target minorities. These people simply donrsquot like the idea of Catholic schools but have nothing to justy their hostility. Each year they are reduced to scanning Scotlandrsquos cultural horizon looking for any little wrinkles that can be swollen into  outrage.Professor Sir Tom Devine, Scotlandrsquos foremost historian, said of this: ldquoIf there was one action certain to inflame sectarian tensions in Scotland it would be any suggestion from the Scottish lrmGovernment of an intention to abolish Catholic schools. That would rightly be regarded as an attack on the Catholic community itself.Laughably, the same people who attack Catholic schools are often to be found in the cultural vanguard that disdains Orange Parades. Of course, nice, well-dressed climate and political protests where we all stop for croissants and smoothies at some chi-chi deli are deemed acceptable. But Orange parades where the marchers, often poor, are hanging on to that pillar of their existence that lends meaning to their lives are considered beyond the pale. Not for the first time this Scot of Irish-Catholic heritage finds more common ground with the Orange Order than with the intolerant liberals who seek to ban their walks. It seems that we have a common and implacable enemy."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-confirms-yes-vote-independence-reversed","story":"The First Minister said she thought such an outcome was unlikely, but acknowledged democracy meant people would be entitled to cancel a Yes vote though another referendum.The previously unreported comments, made in Berlin on Wednesday, are likely to fuel calls for a confirmatory vote being made a precondition of holding Indyref.They also suggest the aftermath of any Yes vote could be as politically turbulent as the one following Brexit, as Unionists could try to have the result overturned.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoAs soon as you say a referendum result is irreversible, by definition itrsquos not democratic.ldquoBecausepeople change their mind, orcircumstances change, thentheyrsquore not allowed to change the decision, then itrsquos not democratic.Asked directlya vote for independence could be reversed by a later vote for the Union, she accepted it was a possibility, adding: ldquoItrsquos up to people to decide the future they want.The Scottish LibDems and Tories said it was a recipe for endless ldquochaos.:Paul Hutcheon: In indyref, the stakes would be so much higher for UnionistsMs Sturgeon has said she wants another vote on the constitution next year, but the UK Tory Government has so far refused to grant Holyrood the necessary powers to hold it.Labour has said it is open to a second referendum, provided Nationalist parties win a fresh and unambiguous mandate, with some Labour MPs also pushing for a confirmatory vote on the outcome of independence negotiations between Edinburgh and London.Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks are fully consistent with her desire to revisit the No result of the  referendum and the Brexit result of the  referendum.However they will dismay parts of the Yes movement, including some SNP MPs, who warned her not to set a precedent by backing a second Brexit referendum in case it opened the door to Unionist challenges to independence.The SNP Governmentrsquos  White Paper on Independence was silent on the possibility of a further referendum, declaring that independence would follow  months of negotiations.Senior SNP politicians also try to avoid hypothetical questions about a Yes vote possibly being overturned.But Ms Sturgeon, in Germany to meet politicians and business leaders and receive a media prize for being a ldquovoice of reason on Brexit, was unable to escape her own logic on the issue.:Jeremy Corbyn will not allow indyref in lsquoformative yearsrsquo of Labour governmentAt a press conference at the German Council on Foreign Relations, she was asked by a Czech news agency reporterthere would be a third independence referendumshe lost Indyref.After saying she thought Scotland would back independence, she said: ldquoNo politician can decide that a country no longer has the ability to choose its own future. Somebody in the Brexit context in the UK last week or the week before made the point that referendums can either be irreversible or they can be democratic, they canrsquot be both.ldquoBecause as soon as you say a referendum result is irreversible, by definition itrsquos not democratic.ldquoBecausepeople change their mind, orcircumstances change, thentheyrsquore not allowed to change the decision, then itrsquos not democratic.ldquoSo at the end of the day, itrsquos up to people to decide the future of Scotland, as it is up to people to decide the future of any country.When askedthat logic applied to independence, she did not dispute it. She was asked: ldquoSo that would mean,the Scottish people decide for independence, there could also be a next referendum in a few years for the Scottish people to decide against independence again ldquoThat would be OK with you Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoDemocracyrsquos not conditional. Itrsquos not for politicians to decide the limits that they place on democracy. Itrsquos up to people to decide the future they want.ldquoBut no country, to my knowledge, that has become independent from the UK... and I think since the end of the Second World War I think there have been several countries that have become independent from the UK, none of them have decided to change their minds and go back the way, and I donrsquot think that it is likely that Scotland would do that either.Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoSNP supporters will go bananas to hear the First Minister is lining up Indyref as well as Indyref.

Should they be abolished in a major reform of working practices that gives us more time off, wonders Stephen Jardine.The queue at the bus stop was longer than usual. And a bit grumpier. That was because the buses were on a Saturday service even though it was a Monday.If you are following this so far, well done. It is about to get really complicated. On the third Monday in September, Edinburgh has a Public Holiday. Not a Bank Holiday. In the rest of Scotland, the holiday is next Monday. Except the Borders, who take the second Monday in October. Oh, and Fe which waits until the third Monday in October.The labyrinthian web of our public and bank holidays is hard enough for mere locals to decipher. What chance have you gotyou are an overseas business trying to work out why no one answers the phones or emails in parts of Scotland on certain peculiar days These odd throwbacks to the past date from the days when mandatory closures were the only way to give rest and respite to the mass of the workers. If the banks and great institutions of Government were closed then no work could be done and nothing could happen. It really was that simple.: Four-day week: Read this and you’ll be convinced it makes sense – Angela CrawleyFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereNowadays nobody actually notices anymore. Online banking has made Bank Holidays obsolete and unless you physically need to visit a local authority office on a specic day, the closed sign will probably pass you by.School closures are the one manestation most likely to impact the general public but families will just put it down to the ongoing drama that is being a working parent when your child is going through education.And as for those who don’t work for central or local government, well it is just another working day. With economic growth forecasts downgraded under the shadow of Brexit, an enforced shutdown is the last thing most businesses need or can afford.So who benefits  On every bank and public holiday we all try to do the same things. If it is sunny, Portobello Beach is packed and the main roads are jammed with people trying to get out of town. If it is wet, we are stuck inside trying to fix wonky shelves and catch up on Game of Thrones.In the joined-up, technologically advanced society of  with business and communication happening around the world rather than just with someone down the road, is this really the best way to deliver leisure time The answer isn’t less holidays. It’s a well-known fact that we work the longest hours in Europe but still lag behind the continent when it comes to productivity. Could part of the answer be our rigid adherence to set date holidays Increasingly we are seeing companies finding creative ways to be modern employers. Last week it was reported some firms are now allowing staff to set their own wages in consultation with colleagues. Others are switching to a four-day week or nine-day fortnight in a bid to deliver the elusive work-le balance.Surely the way forward for us all is a statutory increase in the amount of holidays for every person in this land but for us to use them as and when we want. As society changes, our approach to holidays also has to alter, otherwise the past risks holding back our future.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna cherry vows to pull out all the stops on parliament suspension legal case","story":"The Scottish MP at the heart of the court challenge against Boris Johnson#s suspension of Parliament has said political leadersmust #pull out the stops# to get the Commons sittingthe government loses.Joanna Cherry spoke out amid claims that the UK government could effectively continue with the suspension of Parliament eventhe Supreme Court finds prorogation to have been unconstitutional in its judgement next week.The Edinburgh South West MP said “From a political perspective I do think it’s very important thatthe Supreme Court finds in our favour that all politicians pull out the stops to make sure that Parliament gets back to work as soon as possible.”The Law Society of Scotland yesterday defended the independence of the courts amid claims the case has resulted in judges effectively being dragged into the political process.“The Court of Session, High Court and Supreme Court judgments have demonstrated that the judiciary and legal profession act independently and consider cases before them in light of their legal competence, regardless of political or public opinion,” Law Society president John Mulholland and Dean of the Faculty of Advocates Gordon Jackson QC said.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair pilots call off planned strike action","story":"A series of strikes planned by Ryanair pilots have been called off.Members of the British Airline Pilots Associationwere due to walk out on Saturday and then on September , ,  and .The union is embroiled in a long-running row over a series of issues including pay and conditions which has already led to industrial action.Balpa said it had called off the strikes even though the relationship between Ryanair and its pilots in the UK and where remains \"acrimonious\".: Easyjet slammed for new Edinburgh to Birmingham route A statement said: \"Instead of engaging in negotiations Ryanair has reverted to type, electing to punish pilots by withdrawing their travel benefits.\"Despite this, UK pilot representatives consulted striking members yesterday and agreed to suspend any further strikes in order to pave the way for meaningful negotiations under the auspices of the UK conciliation service, Acas.\"Despite a strong turnout for strike action and a high level of commitment among pilots in Ryanair, the pilot representatives took the decision to allow a breathing space in the hope that constructive negotiations could get under way.\"Balpa retains the ability to set new strike dates should it be necessary.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake. Rock legend Roger Waters has been strongly involved in the campaign.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"hands off our gruffalo say families after colin glen vandalism","story":"PARENTS and day-care service providers say ongoing vandalism at Colin Glen Forest Park’s popular Gruffalo Trail is upsetting families who are coming to visit the attraction. Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem. Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set. Gingham tablecloth, matching curtains, egg and chips on the hob and Tara Lynne O’Neill’s Shirley Valentine invites us into her kitchen.Willy Russell’s iconic play, later a film, has been relocated from s Liverpool to Belfast in this winning new production by Patrick J O’Reilly – the artistic director of Tinderbox Theatre Company.Shirley keeps telling us that she is “ years old”, which doesn’t seem that old at all but the character, at this stage in her le, is already done. She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game. It might be harder for Arlene Foster at an election, even allowing that the DUPs support has held up perfectly well in the three years since the EU referendum.The endgame will probably not become clear until the European Council meeting in mid-October. It may be autumn but it is neither mellow nor fruitful. Just very misty, with little sign of the fog clearing.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool.

However DUP councillor David Graham branded the decision as \"politically contrived\" and claimed it would disproportionately impact Protestant, Unionist and Loyalistcommunities. \"No one wants to see flags flying in tatters,\" he said.\"We opposed this consultation because it has been politically contrived. \"There has been clear legal advice to the council that the PUL community would be unfairly impacted due to the cultural and historical traditions within that community.\"The move, which follows months of tensions heightened by the appearance of Soldier F emblems in loyalist areas, was supported by Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.Exact details of the planned poll will be discussed at a future committee meeting and will need to be ratied by full council when it meets in October.Mr Graham said Belfast City Council\"does not have the legal remit to legislate on flags\" in the absence of a ing Assembly. \"Therefore, regardless of the outcome, BCC will not be able to implement any proposals,\" he added.\"This is another outworking of a mess created by Sinn Fein. \"They originally started by proposing a motion on banners, with the assistance of Alliance, now it has turned into a public consultation.\"The DUP has been consistently opposed to the flying of any paramilitary flags.\"The Balmoral representative was referring to a Sinn Fein motion passed in July which forced the council to take legal action against the Department for Infrastructure.The move compelled the council to remove paramilitary flags from its property including UVF banners from lamp-posts in the mixed housing development in Cantrell Close. No action was ultimately taken after the department cited fears over simmering tensions and staff safety.After seeking legal advice the council backed down and the thorny issue was back on its agenda. Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown, who proposed the latest motion, said it is not the local authoritys role to decide how communities express themselves.\"Flags are often displayed as symbols of marking territory in the community, intimidating residents and visitors, and can even impact businesses ability to trade,\" he said.\"However, a shared future does not mean a neutral, nondescript future.\" The Botanic representative said legal emblems and flags can be a safe, respectful and legitimate way to express culture which means the public must be consulted.\"It is not good enough for the council to attempt to take action on an ad hoc basis as flags go up,\" he added. Another unionist councillor who was at yesterdays meeting accused those who supported the action of engaging in a dangerous game of \"chest beating\".\"It simply wont work,\" they said. \"Self regulation is starting to produce results as it has done with bonfires and this decision only serves to undermine that progress. \"Its just another way for the council to wash its hands of the problem. \"No one wants to see paramilitary flags on our streets but this is just going to create more tension.\" The consultation is expected to take place in December or January."},{"url":null,"title":"bishop hailed as a man of vision retires","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My le spiralled out of control.\"The mum-of-two also suffers from cataplexy which means strong emotions can trigger muscle paralyses and sudden collapse.The le-shattering symptoms began when she was a child and often resulted in terrying hallucinations where she would be confronted by her worst fears. \"Whatever I was most scared of is what I would see, things like rats running all over you.\"I spoke to people I could see in my room and even felt the mattress go down when they sat on my bed,\" she added.The visions resulted in her distraught mother turning to a priest to bless the house and exorcise the teenagers bedroom of evil spirits.But the illness continued to inflict its misery. \"I left school with no qualications because I fell asleep during every O-level,\" she recalled.\"My head would just droop and I couldnt get up.\"On nights out Id end up napping in toilet cubicles.\"Excessive daytime sleepiness was dismissed by medics as laziness or wrongly attributed to effects of puberty or depression.Despite the crippling challenges, Sharron pursued a career as a travel agent and worked her way up to a management position with a major UK company.\"As I climbed the ladder and was under more stress I became more frustrated - its such a vicious cycle,\" she said. \"I used to have to leave my desk to nap on the travel brochures out the back.

It got to the point where I just didnt want to be in this world anymore, my two children stopped me from taking myself out of it.\"A leline came eight years ago when Sharron joined the online support group Narcolepsy Ireland.Two years ago she co-founded the Narcolepsy Ireland charity and started an NI support group for the  people who experience the same debilitating symptoms - including the youngest Narcolepsy Northern Ireland member who is aged just .\"Its been a great way to make friends and share experiences,\" she said.Sharron now hopes that members will meet in person as part of a global initiative championed by award winning US author and narcolepsy awareness activist Julie Flygare.A range of events are taking place worldwide with participants encouraged to share snaps on social media.\"I hope it helps people realise that they arent abnormal, they arent freaks,\" Sharron said.\"You dont feel normal until youve met someone  who says that happens to me.\"The proud organiser said connecting with people is crucial for younger sufferers who are prevented from living typical lestyles largely as a result of strict medication routines.\"Those at school or university age dont want others to know that they get prescribed amphetamines because they have a high street value which puts them at risk,\" she said. \"This will help take away the shame and give them a bit of dignity back.\"The coffee afternoon will take place in Cohannon Inn, Dungannon between pm and pm tomorrow with a separate kite flying event taking place on Enniscrone Beach in Co Sligo."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts culture night road closures","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He lost his seat on the last count and Mr Manton wasnt elected.It is understood that the legal action centres on an alleged verbal agreement between the UUP veteran and his party over the conduct of the campaign.Earlier this week, Belfast High Court heard that Mr McGimpsey is to pay £, for ly referring to Derry-born Republic of Ireland player James McClean as a \"super-Provo\". His legal action against the UUP pre-dates that settlement.Mr McGimpsey has been a UUP member for  years and retains membership of the Knock and Ballyhackamore branch.He had been a councillor for almost two decades representing Court and Castlereagh Central before being elected in Lisnasharragh in .Both Mr McGimpsey and the UUP yesterday declined to comment. The veteran politician is also suing Mr Manton for libel. Mr McGimpsey alleges that his running mate defamed him on social media.Mr Manton had tweeted in response to an interview Mr McGimpsey had given prior to the count in which the councillor said he didnt know Mr Manton. \"He was in the Conservative Party and he joined us I think about a year ago so I dont really know the guy. Ive spoken to him once I think,\" Mr McGimpsey said.Mr Manton then tweeted that he wanted to \"clary\" that he had been a member of the UUP \"since January \" and he went on to make other remarks Mr McGimpsey alleges were defamatory.Mr McGimpsey is one of his partys most left-wing and liberal members. He has long been pro-choice on abortion and is a staunch animal rights supporter and critic of Belfast Zoo.Belfast High Court heard on Wednesday that the veteran UUP man will pay the compensation to James McClean in two instalments. Mr McGimpsey had already issued an unreserved apology for the remarks which he said were made \"in the heat of the moment\" in an interview with BBC Radio Ulsters Nolan Show last year.He also paid substantial damages to Sinn Fein councillor Ciaran Beattie for \" and unfounded\" Facebook comments about him last year.Mr McGimpsey and his older brother Michael rose to prominence in the mid-s when they challenged the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the Dublin courts.Speaking previously about the legal action, he said: \"The lawsuit was very much my baby.

EsperSeptember , General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said more details about the deployment will be determined in the coming days, but it would not involve thousands of US troops.Other officials said the US deployment would likely be in the hundreds and the defensive equipment heading to the Middle East would probably include Patriot missile batteries and possibly enhanced radars.The announcement reflected Mr Trump’s comments earlier in the day when he told reporters that showing restraint “shows far more strength” than launching military strikes and he wanted to avoid an all-out war with Iran.Instead, he laid out new sanctions on the Iranian central bank and said the easiest thing to do would be to launch military strikes.“I think the strong person’s approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint,” Mr Trump told reporters during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. “Much easier to do it the other way, and Iran knows thatthey misbehave, they are on borrowed time.”The attack on September th on Saudi Arabian oil fields represents a dramatic escalation of Iranian aggression. pic NfpPRJpT— U.S. Dept of DefenseSeptember , Mr Dunford told reporters the extra equipment and troops would give the Saudis a better chance of defending against unconventional aerial attacks.“No single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that,” he said, “but a layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that may come from Iran.”The US has not provided any hard evidence that Iran was responsible for the attacks, while insisting the investigation continues, but Mr Esper said the drones and cruise missiles used in the attack were produced by Iran.“The attack on September  against Saudi Arabian oil facilities represents a dramatic escalation of Iranian aggression,” Mr Esper said, adding that the US has thus far shown “great restraint”.In deciding against an immediate US strike, Mr Trump for the second time in recent months pulled back from a major military action against Iran that many Pentagon and other advisers fear could trigger a new Middle East war. In June, after Iran shot down an American surveillance drone, Mr Trump initially endorsed a retaliatory military strike then abruptly called it off because he said it would have killed dozens of Iranians.On Friday, he left the door open for a later military response, saying people thought he would attack Iran “within two seconds” but he has “plenty of time”."},{"url":null,"title":"70 year old marathon man dedicates last run memory","story":"A Derry man who has been running competitively for the past forty years will take part in his last full marathon next month in memory of former club member, Martin Gallagher.Harry McNulty is one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club and a familiar face in the local running circuit.At the age of  he has decided to bow out of full marathons but will continue to compete in shorter distances and will no doubt be seen sporting the famous purple colours of his club as he treks through the streets of Derry or tackles the back roads of Donegal.He grew up in Melmore Gardens, Creggan, and now resides in the Waterside area of the city.The -year-old has run  half marathons and will compete in his st, and final, full marathon on October  in Dublin.Harry comes from a family of seven, five boys and two girls, and his brothers Dessie and Brendan were considered the runners in the family. Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening.

I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

And to make it worse, only the least self-aware of their number is expecting any public understanding of their situation, and certainly not any sympathy.Former Green Party leader in Northern Ireland Steven Agnew has left the AssemblyWith the exception of a -minute session where MLAs signed the roll after the last election, it is now  days since the Assembly last sat.Depending on one’s political perspective, it is either Sinn Féin or the DUP’s fault that Stormont is not operating – although, regardless of whether Sinn Féin’s reasons for toppling Stormont were valid, the DUP can point to the fact that it never walked away from the institution..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button But what is incontrovertible is that there is virtually nothing which the other parties – the UUP, SDLP, Alliance, Greens, TUV, PBP and independent Claire Sugden – can do to restore devolution.The system instigated by the Belfast Agreement gives each of the DUP and Sinn Féin, as the largest parties, a veto over whether devolution can .That means that  of the Assembly’s  MLAs are powerless to resolve the impasse. Yet many of the public – understandably unaware of the finer points of the Northern Ireland Act  as amended by the Northern IrelandAct  – simply view all MLAs as feckless workshy scoundrels. Aware of how deeply unpopular our politicians now are, you are unlikely to hear MLAs – even from the smaller parties – complaining too vocerously about this in interviews.Privately, some MLAs speak about their situation with a depressive frustration. Although they are still able to continue with constituency business, and that is a signicant element of any politician’s role, they were elected not to be gloried councillors but as legislators who would scrutinise legislation, set budgets and hold both civil servants and each other to account.Quite logically, the government belatedly cut their pay from £, to £, – a compromise between the fact that they continue to do some work, but are not doing their full jobs, and also the reality thatall salaries are stopped then MLAs will have to find other work.Having done so, there is the potential that much of the political class would simply leave politics, never to .Some observers believe that would be good, sweeping out the deadwood and bringing in new people unshackled to the past.But while new voices can inject energy, there is also a loss of institutional memory – not just of how politics operates in the basics such as scrutinising the work of departments, but in being aware of past mistakes. Solutions which on the outside can seem easy can crumple under the wisdom of someone who remembers what happened the last time that approach was tried. outside of the High Court in Belfast on Friday September  , where he welcomed a ruling by the Court of Appeal in Belfast that  internees, known as the Hooded Men, had a legitimate expectation of a PSNI investigation into their treatment.

But over recent months, there has been a stream of MLAs either leaving the Assembly or leaving politics entirely. There are rumours of other MLAs – at least one of whom is very senior – considering doing likewise.Last week the former Green Party leader Steven Agnew announced that he was leaving politics to become head of the Northern Ireland Renewables Industry Group. Mr Agnew was not only one of the most popular MLAs at Stormont, but also a capable exponent of left-wing political views, someone who was arguably the most consistently left wing voice in the chamber until the arrival of People Before Profit.In June the DUP’s Simon Hamilton – a former finance minister, health minister and economy minister – walked away from politics to become chief executive of Belfast Chamber of Commerce.Although he had admitted to the RHI Inquiry that he had a role in leaking emails naming some of his civil servants, something which dented his reputation, the former accountant was a major a moderating presence at the top of the DUP.The party had already lost Alastair Ross, an unusually free-thinking DUP member with libertarian views who impressed senior police officers and others during his chairmanship of the Justice Committee and was likely to have been a future minister, when he walked away from politics even before the  Assembly election. Paul Girvan also left the Assembly when elected as an MP in June .And behind the scenes, the party lost its key strategic thinker, special adviser Richard Bullick, as a direct result of Stormont’s collapse.Of the  MLAs who have quit since the last election, the majority – six – have been in Sinn Féin, even though the party’s wage policy means that none of its MLAs have actually lost a penny as a result of the governance vacuum.Many of the MLAs it has lost – Ian Milne, Barry McElduff, Elisha McCallion and Michaela Boyle were not in its top tier of talent – which as the perceptive republican commentator Chris Donnelly has for years highlighted is signicantly beneath what should be at the disposal of a party of Sinn Féin’s size, in contrast to its team in the Dáil.However, the party has also lost two signicant and capable figures – Michelle Gildernew, who had to leave Stormont after being elected to Westminster in June  – and Chris Hazzard, who left for the same reason.In Alliance, leader Naomi Long, one of Stormont’s most capable figures, has left the Assembly after deciding to stand in the European election and winning a seat – something unlikely to have been contemplated had devolution been ing.Her predecessor as leader, the former justice minister David Ford, had already retired from politics last June, a year and a half into the Stormont impasse.The SDLP’s Daniel McCrossan, one of the new generation of politicians with signicant potential, is still an MLA but has ed to university to start a postgraduate business degree.Although any profession will always have a certain churn, there is a clear trend both in the numbers of those leaving Stormont and the fact that so many of them are above the Stormont average in terms of their ability and seniority.That is not to denigrate the MLAs who are taking their place. But evenperson for person each of them is of the same calibre, starting off from scratch in a new job immediately involves a signicant loss of experience.Cumulatively, the departures suggest a signicant problem, and that is likely to be exacerbated unless there is a sudden breakthrough in talks which no longer even seem to be happening.If Stormont does , another factor will deter some of those who could contribute the most to improving the standard of government.Northern Ireland politics has descended to the level of a tribal bear pit. That is unattractive to many capable people, just as it was during the Troubles.If devolution can be restored and is to work better than it did when last ing, the structures which contributed to inertia and worse will need to be amended.But that will only be part of the equation – there will need to be capable people to work those structures.try catch  TrendingN.I. heartbreak as promising

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through.
