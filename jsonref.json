The Royal baby won’t be a prince or princess, despite being seventh in line to the throneWhy won’t the Royal baby be a prince or princess?Meghan and Harry’s baby is expected to take their father’s title, Sussex, as the surname—just as Princes George and Louis, and Princess Charlotte took the surname Cambridge.But as the second son of the Prince of Wales, Harry’s children are not entitled to receive a HRH title.That is because of Harry’s great-great-grandfather King George V. The monarch limited the titles given within the Royal family in 1917.He declared: \u0027The grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.’This means that if the new Royal baby is a boy, he will become the Earl of Dumbarton, a subsidiary title given to Prince Harry on the day of his wedding.If the Royal baby is a girl, she would be  Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, with her sons being Lord Mountbatten-Windsor.However, this is only the case as it stands the Queen can make changes that would see Meghan and Harry’s children become princes and princesses. She did just that ahead of the birth of Prince George, issuing a Letters Patent that ensured all of William and Kate Middleton’s children had HRH titles.Without the Queen’s intervention, Charlotte and Louis would have automatically been Lady and Lord. Prince George would still have been a prince because he was the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The Queen may decide to do the same for Harry’s children.World Food Day: All you need to knowChance the Rapper went undercover as a Lyft driver to raise money for Chicago Public SchoolsJennifer Aniston is helping Selena Gomez after she was hospitalized for mental breakdownSpecial Edition Diablo 3 Bundle for Nintendo Switch announcedMeghan Markle pregnant: Royal baby traditions the Duchess will have to followThe Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits musicWhen is Spring 2019: When is the first day of spring and how is it decided?Why did Ariana Grade and Pete Davidson split up?Meghan Markle pregnant: This is why Prince Harry\u0027s baby won\u0026#8217t get a prince or princess title like George and Charlotte doMeghan Markle Prince Harry Royal Tour: What will the couple do in Australia?Man Booker Prize 2018 long list: All you need to know Meghan Markle pregnant: All you need to know about Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s babyMeghan Markle pregnant: When is the Royal baby due? X Factor 2018 spoilers: Who are the final 16 and when are the live shows?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Friday, October 12"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/14/21/5152C16800000578-0-image-m-12_1539550196913.jpg","title":"Heavily pregnant Pippa Middleton spotted arriving Lindo Wing","story":"    James Matthews carries two large bags into the Lindo Wing yesterday at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington, West London          James Matthews, carrying a £78 Cam Cam Copenhagen baby changing bag and another holdall, entered the hospital on Monday          Mr Matthews arrived at the private maternity unit three days after attending Eugenie\u0027s wedding with Pippa in Windsor Kate suffered from severe morning sickness when she was expecting her children, but Pippa has boasted that she was enjoying a Zen-like pregnancy - using meditation to cope with the last few weeks before she gives birth.The socialite attended the royal wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday, sitting in the front row of the nave at St George\u0027s Chapel with her husband plus her brother James Middleton.Not so understated after all!

The knock-on effect is making my back and sacrum both uncomfortable and achy.

At this station, Southern had 66 per cent of trains late or cancelled, while Thameslink was only marginally better, with 59 per cent.The analysis adopts a more stringent approach to punctuality than the rail industry, which only classifies a train as late if it arrives at its final destination more than five minutes behind schedule. This rises to ten minutes or more for long distance trains.But Which? - which obtained the data between January 1 and September 30 from tracking site On Time Trains - marked a train as late if it arrived at least one minute behind schedule.It said that even a delay of a few minutes can have a knock on effect on other services on the network, and can cause a passenger to miss their onward journey.

The knock-on effect is making my back and sacrum both uncomfortable and achy. The transformations to my body that are taking place as it prepares for childbirth have meant that the sound sleeps and the baby bubble effect have gone. Reality is finally kicking in.\u0027Perhaps this is the body’s way of making sure that you get in tune with what lies ahead.\u0027Pippa also said she had signed up to a beginners\u0027 meditation class, which would involve learning how to meditate twice daily for 20 minutes while chanting a mantra.    She previously revealed how she had been turning to barre-style workouts and swimming during pregnancy. It comes as Kensington Palace announced yesterday morning that an overjoyed Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby.

Too many\u0027.Both Harry and Meghan have spoken openly about wanting to start a family.The topic cropped up in their engagement interview, with Harry, saying: \u0027Hopefully we\u0027ll start a family in the near future.\u0027The pair are also known for their warm, caring approach when meeting youngsters on official visits.Even the duchess\u0027s father Thomas Markle, whom she is believed not to have spoken to since her wedding, said he expected children soon.Mr Markle is not believed to have been told the news in advance of today\u0027s announcement.He told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain in an interview a month after the duke and duchess married: \u0027She\u0027s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.\u0027Announcing their baby news Kensington Palace said today: \u0027Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.

The Royal couple arrived on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, for their first major international tour since their world-stopping nuptials.They shunned a private jet to travel on flight Qantas flight QF2 from London via Singapore.The couple were in the first class cabin but non-royal passengers were also with them with one saying they were heard saying how \u0027excited\u0027 they were to be travelling to Australia. With them was their entourage of 10 staff members, including press secretaries and a hairdresser, and several more security staff. Royal fans already suspected the Duchess was pregnant after she wore a suspiciously wide-fitting Givenchy coat to Princess Eugenie\u0027s royal wedding on Friday.Many TV viewers were sure they could see a baby-bump beneath her long, navy blue coat as the Duchess was whisked into St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor by her doting husband. The couple held hands when they arrived in Sydney early on Monday morning on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore.Meghan was wearing her favourite Sarah Flint heels, which she teamed with the two tone coat she wore in a photo of her and Harry posing with the official 2018 Invictus Games flag last week.Earlier she sparked a storm of pregnancy speculation after she touched down in Sydney clutching two purple folders in front of her stomach.Meghan Markle was seen holding the items in her right arm as she stepped off the plane on Monday morning with Prince Harry, leaving fans of the Royal couple guessing what information they could contain. For many, the folders added to speculation Meghan Markle is expecting a baby, fuelling the fire already stoked by the large blue coat she wore at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding last week. The couple returned to their own wedding venue at Windsor Castle on Friday but missed a lavish second day of celebrations on Saturday because of their flight to Australia.            Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are pictured arriving at Admiralty House in Sydney\u0027s Kirribilli as keen Royal watchers look on          The motorcade carrying Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, makes its way through peak hour traffic on Sydney\u0027s Eastern Distributor on Monday morningMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayWoman fights a large man over parking disputePrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementWoman trips and falls face first into a shark tank in Chinese mallCabinet ministers arrive for crunch Brexit talks at Downing StreetShocking moment robbers use group of hostages as human shieldNZ mother attacks school girl due to bullying allegations    Prince Harry appeared to take some time out on Monday during his trip to Admiralty House, spotted perched on a step alongside a man believed to be a security guard (pictured)          Flying from London to Sydney is a tiring journey, but The Duchess of Sussex was in the best possible cabin for the 23-hour trip – first class in a Qantas A380 (file picture).It\u0027s a state-of-the-art aircraft with in-built anti-jet-lag technology.It produces 50 per cent less cabin noise than a 747 and has cabin air pressure that\u0027s equivalent to an altitude of 1,500 metres (5,000ft). The 747\u0027s is 2,500 metres (8,000ft).Plus, cabin air is recycled every two minutes to keep the atmosphere fresh.Then there\u0027s the Qantas touch.Meghan would have been in an \u0027expansive armchair\u0027 that converts to a fully flat bed.Cabin crew would have given her a pillow menu, a 100 per cent cotton woven throw, a duvet and a memory foam mattress. And cotton pyjamas with matching slippers.She would also have been able to enjoy an in-seat massage at the touch of a button and pressed another one to lower and raise the window blinds.It\u0027s definitely an aircraft fit for pregnant royalty.                                                      They will spend a week in the country and then on Tuesday, October 23 they will head to Fiji for two days and then on to Tonga before returning to Australia.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31. \u0027The programme across these four Commonwealth countries will focus on youth leadership, environmental and conservation efforts, including the dedication of several new Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy projects, and the recovery and rehabilitation of servicemen and women through the Invictus Games Sydney 2018,\u0027 the palace said in a short statement when announcing the tour itinerary.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will attend 76 engagements across the four countries, including the Invictus Games in Sydney, which runs from October 20 and October 28.Prince Harry founded the sporting event, which gives sick and injured service personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball, in 2014.The couple will mark the games\u0027 launch and closing ceremony. And to officially welcome the Invictus Games to the city, Prince Harry, prime minister Scott Morrison and athletes will scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge to plant the Invictus flag. Among the other highlights of their tour will be a visit to the world-renowned Taronga Zoo, in Sydney, where they will meet two koalas and their joeys. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the zoo with Prince George during their royal tour in 2014.Elsewhere the couple will visit Australian farmers struck by drought. The couple\u0027s arrival in Australia comes just days after they attended the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank where they told close family their happy news.   Revealed: How Meghan and Harry\u0027s baby will be SEVENTH in line to the throne - but WON\u0027T be a prince or princessThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. The child will come behind his or her father Prince Harry in the line of succession, bumping his uncle, the Duke of York, further down the line into eighth place.  However the child will not be given the title of prince or princess unless the Queen steps into change the rules.

The baby will bump Harry\u0027s uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queen\u0027s youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time to 11th in line.How will the baby be related to the Queen?The baby will be a great-grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales\u0027s grandchild and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s niece or nephew.Will he or she ever be monarch?Unlikely. The baby will have three cousins Prince George - a future king - and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, who are further up the line of succession, so it is a safe bet that throne will stay on the Cambridge side of the family.What will the baby be called?William and Kate chose royal favourites for their children.But will Harry and American-born Meghan go classic or break the royal mould when naming their baby?If they stay traditional, something like Alice, Mary, Elizabeth or Victoria for a girl, and James, Philip, Frederick or Arthur for a boy are possibilities.In the US, the most popular name for a baby girl is Emma and Liam for a baby boy.Will the baby be a prince or princess?No they will not be a prince nor a princess, nor an HRH because George V limited titles within the Royal Family in 1917.So what will their title be?A son would be known as Earl of Dumbarton - because a first son of a duke is allowed to use one of his father\u0027s other lesser titles as a courtesy title.Harry was also made the Earl of Dumbarton on the morning of his wedding, as well as being given a dukedom.A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could change this?Yes. The Queen stepped in ahead of George\u0027s birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridges\u0027 children had fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny?Harry has been close to all his nannies and it is likely he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements Kate and William have the help of their full-time live-in nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. But Meghan\u0027s mother Doria has been seen attending baby care classes, suggesting that she may move to the UK to help out. When and where will the baby be born?Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing in St Mary\u0027s Hospital, Paddington, so Meghan might follow her sister-in-law\u0027s lead. Harry was also born there in 1984. It is close to Kensington Palace and well practised at dealing with royal births, and the publicity surrounding them. But Meghan could do down a different path and have a home birth. Will the baby have dual citizenship?Harry and Meghan could apply for their child to have dual US-UK citizenship. Meghan is planning to become a British citizen - but it is not known whether she will hold dual nationality, and at present is still a US citizen.Kensington Palace announced today the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant with her first child. The baby is expected in Spring next year. The happy news was announced hours after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Sydney for their first major international tour since their wedding in May.A Kensington Palace said: \u0027Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.\u0027Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.\u0027The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were told in person at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday.  Rumours were rife that Meghan may be pregnant after her mother Doria Ragland was seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena with a view to looking after her new grandchild. The duchess has also been seen in a number of looser-fitting outfits over recent weeks.  The new royal baby is expected to take the surname Sussex in the same way that Prince William\u0027s children, George, Charlotte and Louis have taken his title Cambridge as their last name at school and nursery. The baby will supersede Prince Andrew in the line of succession, regardless of whether they are a boy or a girl, following a 2011 change in law that granted the same status to sons and daughters.However as the second son of the current Prince of Wales, Harry\u0027s children are not automatically given the title of prince or princess.King George V - Harry\u0027s great great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in 1917.This means Harry and Meghan\u0027s first born, as a great-grandchild of the sovereign, is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH.George V declared that: \u0027the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.\u0027The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his father\u0027s lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debrett\u0027s.So a first son of Harry\u0027s would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons Lord (first name) Mounbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could make changes to allow Harry and Meghan\u0027s children to be HRHs and princes and princesses.Ahead of Prince George\u0027s birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles.Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince.The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghan\u0027s baby.  The Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign.But the couple decided, with the Queen\u0027s agreement, that their children would use the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl rather than the style prince or princess.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement in November 2017, shortly after confirming their relationship. The couple married at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May this year.   Is Fergie\u0027s tweetstorm a swipe at Meghan for upstaging Eugenie with baby news at her wedding?

Just hours before Harry and Meghan\u0027s happy news was announced this morning, fans couldn\u0027t help but notice the strategically-placed plastic folders the Duchess was clutching to her chest after touching down in Sydney in an oversized coat and polo neck            Meghan\u0027s choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame (pictured with the Queen and Prince Harry outside St. George\u0027s Chapel)But it was her choice of clothing that was the most telling, with the Duchess - once a fan of figure-hugging silhouettes - wrapping up in a turtleneck jumper and oversized navy coat.Likewise, her choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding last week - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame.Coincidentally, it was also the day that Meghan and Harry chose to share their happy news with the rest of the family. Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage told Femail: \u0027We are so used to seeing Meghan in form-fitting apparel, it was hard not to speculate that a new arrival was imminent when she recently started to sport baggier items. \u0027The use of knee-length coats has cleverly helped Meghan avoid speculation and, as it\u0027s now very much the autumnal season, the use of long oversized coats didn\u0027t arouse suspicion. Moment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayWoman fights a large man over parking disputePrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementWoman trips and falls face first into a shark tank in Chinese mallCabinet ministers arrive for crunch Brexit talks at Downing StreetShocking moment robbers use group of hostages as human shieldNZ mother attacks school girl due to bullying allegations      Earlier this month, Meghan visited Sussex in a businesslike bottle-green ensemble but was careful to drape a structured coat over the top to carefully conceal her silhouette (pictured with Prince harry at Edes House in Chichester on 3 October)    Careful planning: Meghan wore a draped Givenchy dress at the Royal Academy of Arts in September (left) and an Oscar de la Renta peplum top in Loughborough in September (right)Moment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayWoman fights a large man over parking disputePrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementWoman trips and falls face first into a shark tank in Chinese mallCabinet ministers arrive for crunch Brexit talks at Downing StreetShocking moment robbers use group of hostages as human shieldNZ mother attacks school girl due to bullying allegations      Covering up: Meghan wore an oversized blue coat for the launch of a charity cookbook at Kensington Palace last month (pictured with Prince Harry and mother Doria Ragland, who said today she was \u0027very happy\u0027 about the couple\u0027s pregnancy news and may move to the UK)            Baby blue?

The United States is the dominant energy player so we\u0027re in pretty good shape, in my opinion, with our energy boom to cover any shortfalls.

But Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance has led several business leaders and media outlets to back out of the upcoming investment conference in Riyadh called the Future Investment Initiative.Khashoggi has written extensively for the Post about Saudi Arabia, criticizing its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women\u0027s rights activists after the lifting of a ban on women driving.

The director then told Egan to do the same to him, but he says he resisted.Singer denied these allegations, claiming they were \u0027outrageous, vicious, and completely false.\u0027Egan ultimately withdrew his lawsuit after turning down a $100,000 settlement from Singer with an option to re-file at any time.Singer launched his career with The Usual Suspects and later earned raves for his work in the first two X-Men films, though he followed that up with a number of underwhelming flops, including Superman Returns and Jack the Giant Slayer. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/15/16/4AD94EBA00000578-0-image-a-6_1539619187330.jpg","title":"When Spring 2019 day spring decided","story":"The date differs because the astronomical calendar uses seasonal data in relation to the 23.5 degree axis of the Earth and the sun’s position of the equator.The seasons are set by the solstices and equinoxes.

At this station, Southern had 66 per cent of trains late or cancelled, while Thameslink was only marginally better, with 59 per cent.The analysis adopts a more stringent approach to punctuality than the rail industry, which only classifies a train as late if it arrives at its final destination more than five minutes behind schedule. This rises to ten minutes or more for long distance trains.But Which? - which obtained the data between January 1 and September 30 from tracking site On Time Trains - marked a train as late if it arrived at least one minute behind schedule.It said that even a delay of a few minutes can have a knock on effect on other services on the network, and can cause a passenger to miss their onward journey.

He said \u0027Thank you very much.\u0027Archie gave them a drawing he had made of Harry and Meghan. \u0027She said, \u0027That\u0027s so beautiful.

They were so beautiful. I shook both their hands.\u0027You don\u0027t get this once in a million years. I skipped school for the day - and I met Harry and Meghan! It\u0027s absolutely awesome. They are just so amazing - that\u0027s why I am overcome with emotion.\u0027Abbey van Vuuren, 37, was there with her children Madeline, six, and Poppy, four, who gave Harry and Meghan Possum Magic, a book which their mother used to read to them when they were very small. \u0027She said, \u0027This is the first book we\u0027ve been given for the baby.\u0027Another group of 15-year-old schoolgirls skipped school for the day - and even made a poster to proclaim the fact.

She said, \u0027I will keep it in mind.\u0027 She was so kind. She was really genuine.\u0027After a wet and windy start to their time in Sydney the sun was shining for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first public walkabout since they revealed a royal baby is on the way.Around two thousand people packed into the promenade outside the world famous Sydney Opera House as royal well wishers flocked gathered keen to catch a glimpse of the royal couple.Shortly before 1pm Harry and Meghan spent more than their scheduled 20 minutes meeting and greeting the incredibly excited locals as royal baby fever seemed to have already reached fever pitch in the city.But their attention was dedicated to one special fan who has stolen a kiss from Prince Harry on more than one occasion.Daphne Dunne, 98, has been dubbed Prince Harry\u0027s \u0027favourite Aussie\u0027 with the Duke of Sussex stopping to have lengthy chats with her during both his 2015 and 2017 trips to Australia.          The royals climbed aboard a water transfer - Admiral Hudson flying the White ensign of the Royal Australian Navy - after the visit to Taronga Zoo for a 20 minute crossing of the harbour to the Sydney Opera house          After their zoo visit, the couple strolled down a walkway towards Sydney Harbour to take a boat towards from the Man O\u0027War Steps, the landing point for British and Australian fleets for 150 years            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped out in Australia today for the first day of engagements during their tour - which coincided with Meghan announcing she was pregnant. Meghan was seen wearing Diana\u0027s butterfly earrings and bracelet as she and Harry made their way down to the Man O\u0027War steps to take a boat across Sydney Harbour          Meghan and Harry chat as they watch the modern dance inside the Sydney Opera House on the first full day of their Aussie tour          The royal couple watched a rehearsal at the Sydney Opera House of Spirit 2018 by the Bangarra Dance Theatre, an internationally acclaimed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander modern dance company          Bangarra tour their dance shows across Australia and have also performed in London and New York    Overjoyed: Meghan arriving in Sydney yesterday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced todayPrince Harry is ‘happier than he has ever been’ as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an ‘emotional wreck - but in a good way!’ since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.‘It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn’t be happier. He is so protective of her,’ the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week.Meghan, 37, is understood to have just had her 12-week scan. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie’s wedding. It sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who has made no secret of his desire to start a family.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, toward the end of July, conceived their first child.In the middle of that month, they were on a ‘mini-moon’ royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry’s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.                                                    As they clasped hands Harry, 34, said: \u0027I was looking for you earlier and hoped you\u0027d be here, it\u0027s so good to see you again.\u0027Harry immediately looked round his shoulder and scanned the crowd for his wife, keen to introduce her to his special fan.Soon enough, the Duchess - who had been warmly greeted by hundreds of well wishers congratulating the couple on her pregnancy - approached Ms Dunne, knelt down and hugged her.War widow Daphne\u0027s first husband, Lieutenant Albert Chowne, died aged 25 in 1945 during an attack on a Japanese machine gun post in Papua New Guinea.He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross which Mrs Dunne was wearing when she first met Prince Harry.Meghan said: \u0027I\u0027m so glad I got to meet you. Harry has told me all about you and your special bond, it\u0027s so lovely you came to see us, thank you.\u0027Daphne said: \u0027It was lovely to meet the Duchess Meghan. Harry is a wonderful man and I\u0027m so happy he had found happiness, they both deserved the absolute world together.\u0027Asked if this time was the most special meeting her hero Harry, Daphne said: \u0027We\u0027ll it was certainly different. He\u0027s married now for a start and he looks very happy. I am over the moon for him. She is a wonderful girl.\u0027I congratulated them on their baby and said I wished them all the happiness they deserve.\u0027Before leaving, Meghan told her: \u0027Hopefully next time we\u0027ll have our little one with us.\u0027 Other editable locals included sisters Hannah and Francesca Francis, 12 and 10, said they were \u0027super excited\u0027 to meet the Royal couple outside the Opera House.The schoolgirls said they had waited for three hours to just catch a glimpse of the royal couple and \u0027couldn\u0027t believe it\u0027 when the royal couple came over to speak to them.Hannah said: \u0027I told my sister we would see Meghan today but I couldn\u0027t believe it when she came over to speak to us.\u0027She was so nice and friendly and she is so pretty. She was so nice to us and said thank you for coming down to meet her.\u0027Francesca said: \u0027We were both super excited to meet Harry and Meghan I just can\u0027t believe we did.\u0027Our friends are going on be so jealous, we\u0027re going to be taking about this forever.\u0027    Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are seen meeting Ruby a mother Koala who gave birth to koala joey Meghan, named after Her Royal Highness          Prince Harry and his wife the Duchess of Sussex announced on Monday morning they are expecting their first child          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex met the tiny bears named after them when they married in May          Up close and personal: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were spotted stroking the bears at the Taronga Zoo           The Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them          The ten-month old joeys were wedding gifts from the people of NSW for the couple, who got married in May - and just announced they were expecting their own baby          Meghan, showing just a hint of a baby bump, cooed at the koalas before stroking them, saying: \u0027Sweet, cute\u0027 as keeper Suzie MacNamara explained how the animals are threatened in the wild          In front of hundreds of Taronga staff, donors, young volunteers and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian (second from left), Meghan used golden scissors to cut a line of green tape to open the centre          After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre          The couple was presented with a koala toy for their new baby - a hastily arranged surprise for the couple after the news of their pregnancy yesterday          Prince Harry - who has previously met koalas - was a tad more irreverent during the meeting          The then walked to the new Taronga Institute of Science and Learning holding hands, inspecting quokkas and wallabies before heading into the koala enclosure    The Duchess seemed very taken by the cuddly furballs and listened intently before asking if she could stroke them          After being invited to pet the echidna, the Duchess tentatively stroked its spines, which are used to track the animals and monitor their diet          The scientific research will allow those tackling the illegal wildlife trade to better pinpoint where animals are coming fromThe Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them.\u0027Taronga Zoo seems to be leading the way.

I\u0027m going to get my wife to come over to say hello,\u0027 he said to Ms Dunne, before introducing his wife to her.\u0027Oh my goodness, is this Daphne? I\u0027m so happy to finally meet you. I\u0027ve heard so much about you - all good things,\u0027 Meghan said as the two women clasped hands. Ms Dunne replied: \u0027It\u0027s wonderful, the two of you\u0027 as she  congratulated the pair on their exciting baby news: \u0027Congratulations, it\u0027s just what Harry needs.\u0027He will be a marvellous dad. He won\u0027t let anything stand in his way and he will be so gentle and loving.\u0027During their heartwarming encounter, Prince Harry noticed something different about Ms Dunne.\u0027Have you dyed your hair a shade of pink?\u0027 he asked, to which she responded \u0027yes\u0027.The royal fan gifted the couple flowers, as Meghan thanked her, adding: \u0027Hopefully next time we see you, we\u0027ll have a little one with us.\u0027       Daphne Dunne has been reunited with Prince Harry, and she got to meet wife Meghan Markle    A blast from the past: The pair reunited on Tuesday (right) after meeting in 2015 (left) and 2017            Ms Dunne (pictured) first met Prince Harry at the Opera House when he visited Sydney in 2015Speaking to AAP following her meet-and-greet with Meghan, Ms Dunne said: \u0027She said she had heard all about me, she\u0027s so beautiful.\u0027Ms Dunne first met the Prince at the Sydney Opera House in  2015 where she nabbed a kiss on the cheek after he noticed the Victoria Cross she wore.Two years later, the pair crossed paths again when they shared a kiss and hug after she waited to meet him in the pouring rain for seven hours with an esky full of beers.Appearing on the Today show on Tuesday  before the meeting, the super royal fan shared her excitement about the prospect of meeting Prince Harry for the third time.\u0027I\u0027m quite excited. I don\u0027t think he has changed very much but I probably have. Seeing my age is going up, up, up,\u0027 she told reporter Sylvia Jeffreys.\u0027He\u0027s a natural. He just loves what he\u0027s doing but seems to fit in with everything he says. I\u0027m very happy for him. I\u0027m glad he\u0027s got a wife now and soon a bubba.\u0027            Prince Harry introduced his wife to Ms Dunne, who waited to meet the couple with flowers            Meghan told Ms Dunne that she hopes the next time they meet again, she would see their baby            Beautiful moment! Ms Dunne was overjoyed when she got to see her Prince again on TuesdaySpeaking fondly about the Prince, Ms Dunne told Sunrise: \u0027Harry is just wonderful, you couldn\u0027t describe him any other way.\u0027I have to meet Meghan because she and Harry are really in love, you can see it coming out of their eyes and out of their hearts too.\u0027Weighing in on the baby joy, Ms Dunne said: \u0027I\u0027m thrilled for them, especially Harry because I know how he wanted a baby, now he\u0027s got his wish.\u0027She added that Prince Harry will be a \u0027hands on\u0027 father when the baby arrives.Reminiscing their heartwarming encounter, Ms Dunne told the Today show a selfless Prince Harry seemed unfazed when he braved the rain to talk to her in May 2015.\u0027He didn\u0027t worry about, he just continued on with what he was doing, which was talking to me,\u0027 she recalled.\u0027When he started to go, he gave me a kiss on the cheek. And when he came back later, he gave me another one because I was lopsided, and I had to have another kiss to put me right.\u0027When asked where the third kiss will go, Ms Dunne laughed as she responded: \u0027I don\u0027t know, I might not even get one.\u0027       Thomas Markle, the father of the Duchess of Sussex has said he believes she will be a \u0027great mom\u0027 - but his daughter did not tell him she is pregnant            Insiders have said Prince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next Spring            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walk in the grounds of Admiralty House in Sydney on the first day of their visit to AustraliaThe announcement by Kensington Palace revealed that  Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland knew about the pregnancy and was said to be \u0027very happy\u0027. Thomas was not mentioned.  \u0027Thomas is absolutely delighted. He heard the news before it was made public and was overjoyed. He thinks Meghan will make a great mum as she is already so maternal,\u0027 said a source to The Sun. Meghan is believed to have not spoken to her father since before her wedding to Prince Harry in May after Thomas backed out at the last minute due to ill health. Her half-sister Samantha was pictured yesterday buying a congratulatory card for the couple. She told The Sun she hoped the baby would bring the family closer together. She said: \u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.\u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027             Doria Ragland, pictured with her daughter in May, said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027            Meghan is seen resting her head on Prince Harry\u0027s shoulder as the meet and greet came to an end on Tuesday afternoon            The royal couple are pictured coming down the steps of the iconic Sydney Opera House to speak with fans waiting outside      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding (above) Thomas was spotted out and about buying groceries during which time the former Hollywood lighting director denied reports that he dabbled with using cocaine as he brought Meghan up.\u0027Never happened, no comment,\u0027 Thomas said when asked about the drug use reports. Grandfather-to-be Thomas was spotted shopping alone for groceries as Meghan and Harry were breaking news of their pregnancy to the Royal Family who he has never met.The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s father drove across the US border from his home in Rosarito, Mexico on Friday around the time his daughter and son-in-law were telling relatives at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding they were expecting their first child.Thomas appeared to be in high spirits as he was pictured buying beers, pot pies and firewood from the grocery store in San Ysidro, California.A store employee was spotted helping the 74-year-old wheel his shopping cart to his car and load his groceries into his trunk.              Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet Findlay Blue , four, and Dasha Gallagher, six,  after they officially opened the Taronga Institute of Science and Learning at Taronga Zoo in Sydney today Meghan\u0027s mother, meanwhile, released a statement expressing her joy about the news she is set to become a grandmother for the first time.Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027. Last month, Ragland was spotted taking baby-care classes in her hometown of Pasadena, California. There is a possibility she could move to London to help look after the child because Meghan may not want to hire a nanny. Kensington Palace declined to comment on whether Meghan\u0027s father was told.\u0027Thomas sees this as a chance to fix the problems between him, Meghan and Harry. He is desperate to be there for his grandchild and wants to play an active role in their life\u0027, Thomas\u0027s other daughter and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha said to The Sun. \u0027It just makes everything that happened over the last year disappear. I want Meghan to be happy and calm and have peace. Everybody needs to be positive.\u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.  \u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027 \u0027At a proper time, there should be a sit-down wherein everyone can address this properly. Everything has to work itself out. I want to allow Meg and Harry to bring my dad into it in their own appropriate time because they very well should do. Although I can still say I love my sister, I wasn\u0027t happy with the way my father was being treated.\u0027But, you know, we\u0027re also seeing now that there was a lot going on — there may have been a lot of stress.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding. Meghan, who wed Harry just five months ago, has had her 12 week scan and is believed to be due in late April. Kensington Palace made the announcement after the couple arrived in Sydney on Monday on the eve of their 16-day major tour which will take in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  Kill him with politeness: Harry effortlessly bats away Australian serial prankster during walkabout... and for once the joker is lost for words The last time Prince Harry was in Australia, radio prankster \u0027Intern\u0027 Pete Deppeler made a fool of himself by repeatedly yelling  \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at the young royal.And it appears the KIIS FM producer didn\u0027t fare much better on Tuesday when the Duke of Sussex returned to Sydney with his pregnant wife Meghan Markle.Pete was stationed at the Opera House to cover the couple\u0027s official tour for the Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O Show, but Harry refused to humour his attention-seeking antics. A royal disaster!

Wait til you hear what Prince Harry said to crush Intern Pete\u0027s ego,\u0027 the caption teased.But fans didn\u0027t have to wait long, as another video was soon uploaded that revealed Harry\u0027s dry-witted response.    \u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry!\u0027 As Meghan and Harry arrived at the Sydney Opera House to meet their Australian fans, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement and began shouting at themAs Meghan and Harry approached the crowd of fans awaiting their arrival at the Opera House, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement.\u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry! I talk to you every year!\u0027 he breathlessly shouted.But Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027.Unfortunately, Pete didn\u0027t take the hint and awkwardly reminded the visiting royal that they had actually met \u0027a few times\u0027 before.             \u0027I talk to you every year!\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition when Intern Pete (pictured) reminded him they\u0027d met beforehand, and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027            \u0027You behave today!\u0027 Meanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027            \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot LavaMeanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete  and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027.In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot Lava.The game requires players to escape the floor by climbing on a surface within five seconds of someone yelling \u0027the floor is lava\u0027.Harry awkwardly laughed as Pete repeatedly shouted \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at him from behind a barricade. It was clear during the exchange that Harry had absolutely no idea what Intern Pete was talking about.   \u0027I\u0027ve longed for kids since I was very, very young\u0027: Heart-melting pictures that prove mischievous Harry was born to be a dadTrust Harry to cheer us up on a grey and fractious news day. Come spring, all being well, he and Meghan will have a baby.The Duchess no doubt will look wonderful cradling the child on the steps of the Lindo Wing, like her mother-in-law Diana and her sister-in-law Kate before her. But let’s come clean, it’s actually Harry we’re delighted for, isn’t it?For as these glorious pictures show, here is a boy who was born to be a dad.Our Harry, the likely lad, the mischievous redhead who didn’t think much of school but relished Army life — ‘running down a ditch full of mud, firing bullets — it’s the way I am, I love it!’.            Father material: Prince Harry cuddles baby Jean Luc in a visit to the Queen Elizabeth II Children\u0027s Hospital in Bridgetown, BarbadosThis is the larky young man who, when caught out starkers playing strip-billiards in Vegas, handsomely apologised and explained that it was just ‘a case of too much Army, and not enough prince’.But this is also a man who soberly pledged himself to his charities and duties, and founded the Invictus Games to bring respect and fun to injured servicemen.He’s our Harry. Few characters are more beguiling than a wild boy who gets into scrapes but does no real harm, then settles down to duty far more merry, open-hearted and tolerant of others than if he’d been a cautious prig all along. Hearts have ached for Harry, too, as he opened up publicly about losing his mother: about walking behind her coffin, trying for years to blank out the sorrow, at last coming to terms.            Born to be a father: Prince Harry visits 8-year old Junior Maynard in the paediatric ward at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in 2010In 2016, when he was first with Meghan, he said he hoped Diana was looking down and approving of how he and his brother turned out. He added, ‘I’m sure she’s waiting for me to have kids so she can be a grandmother again.’Earlier, a bit wistfully after a few failed courtships, he had admitted: ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young. I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.’He has shown us and told us enough about himself to make us rejoice in the idea of him having a family of his own.            Happy family: Harry lifts a three-year-old orphan called Lerato during a visit to Phelisanong Children\u0027s Home in Maseru, LesothoNot least because he should be good at it: one of the vital, underestimated qualities of good parenting is that you enjoy it. A reluctant, distant or runaway dad is a sad thing to contemplate. Every woman approaching the joys and unending anxieties of motherhood is delighted to find a partner who is properly, keenly, up for it.We want a man who is not nervous of babies, enjoys the wayward comedy of toddlers, and puts shy older children at their ease. So just look at how Harry keeps proving all of those things day after day, trip after trip.            Helping hand: The 19-year-old prince plants a tree with young orphan Mutsu Potsane, 4, at the Mants\u0027ase Children\u0027s Home   in Lesotho, southern AfricaSee him cradling seven-week-old Jean-Luc in Barbados, high-fiving a young girl in Africa’s Lesotho, swinging a laughing three-year-old round like everyone’s rumbustious favourite uncle. See him lifting kids, upending them with squeals of glee, larking, pulling faces with an eight-year-old boy in hospital in Barbados, scooping up a young winner of a child bravery award (who had just asked him, ‘Where’s your crown?’) or holding hands and planting a tree with a four-year-old orphan in Lesotho.Watch him make pretend-fierce faces at that little girl who kept stealing his popcorn in the stands at the Invictus Games. Brilliant.These are not just photo-ops, children carefully selected for charm and whisked away if they misbehave. His charities report it is hard to move Harry on, that he notices any shy or confused child in the background and includes them, that a malnourished or injured infant moves him to lean in with instinctive comfort.            Funny faces: Harry, patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, attends Sitting Volleyball competition at the games in Toronto, Ontario, CanadaBabies and small children move us all to protectiveness, and toddler mischief makes almost everyone laugh. But there are a few good omens too for Harry’s future children as they get older.Who can forget his admission about growing up in a royal world of formality. ‘To be honest,’ Harry said, ‘dinner conversations were the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.’This, one feels, will be the kind of father who, after decent politeness, lets his children unobtrusively sneak away from the table.            High five! Prince Harry plays a young child who is going through a programme for malnourishment during a visit to Mokhotlong, LesothoAs for the teenagers, he should have enough fresh memories of his clubbing days both to give them advice, and to see right through any stratagems.It is fashionable to pretend that mothers and fathers are not only equal parents but identical.Certainly men can do traditionally female tasks with nappies and bottles (Harry seemed very adept bottle-feeding that baby rhino recently, even dropping a kiss on its horny face).But there is often something refreshing and breezy about the male approach to childcare.             Prince Harry scoops up six-year-old Alex Burke from Manchester, winner of the Bravest Child Award, who had just asked \u0027where\u0027s your crown?\u0027As the poet and broadcaster Mike Rosen once said, you do all the mum things but you do them in a blokey way. A woman with a young baby is tired, physically battered, exalted and proud, but also probably spends too much time half-crippled with anxiety.Most of us fret about getting everything right and not only being a perfect mother but looking like one: not only must we make the baby contented but avoid criticism from in-laws, neighbours or Mumsnet bullies.Fathers, on the other hand, are more likely to be just plain soppy with pride at having created this perfect creature. There’s no doubt Harry will be proud as Punch. And unlike many new dads, he won’t need much help or advice either.He’ll be right in there, storming through, from nappies to Nintendo and beyond. Lucky baby.  Baby on board! Beaming Meghan and Harry set sail for their first official engagements in Australia including the Opera House and Sydney zoo - hours after revealing their baby joyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex couldn\u0027t hide their delight as they stepped onto a boat to take a tour around Sydney Harbour this morning - hours after revealing their joyous baby news.The beaming couple looked the epitome of cool as they stepped onto the boat, with Prince Harry lovingly holding onto his pregnant wife\u0027s hand as he helped her onto the vessel. They enjoyed a packed day of engagements, which included being introduced to their koala namesakes and a \u0027stud\u0027 of a short-legged echidna, as they admired the \u0027so cute\u0027 wildlife of Taronga Zoo. After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre. Departing, the couple were treated to a ride in a gondola, giving spectacular views over Sydney Harbour and allowing a glimpse of other animal enclosures, including a curious baby elephant.After the Duchess changed into flat shoes, they walked the short journey down a ramp and out of the zoo, catching a ferry - made private for the occasion - to the Sydney Opera House surrounded by armed security.The royal couple were greeted by a sea of well-wishers at the Opera House, where they mingled with the crowd.

When congratulated by the media on their happy news, Harry smiled shyly and said \u0027thanks\u0027. They also accepted good wishes from dignitaries including the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon Gladys Berejiklian MP. \u0027Thank you, that\u0027s very kind,\u0027 said Meghan. The couple posed for a photograph on the croquet lawn with the Governor General and his wife with the magnificent backdrop of Sydney Opera House behind them.The duchess, who hasn\u0027t been to Australia before, marvelled at the view. The foursome were then joined by the Invictus representatives for another group photograph and chatted with them for a few minutes before walking into the house to sign the visitor\u0027s book. Harry sat down first, followed by Meghan, and the prince watched on proudly as his wife, a former calligrapher, signed with a flourish.              The couple sat down to talk with Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove and and Lady Cosgrove at Admiralty House where they will be staying over the coming days.

The four then sat down for a half hour official meeting. \u0027Your Royal Highnesses, welcome to Australia,\u0027 said Sir Peter, \u0027may we on behalf of all Australians congratulate you both on the announcement that you are expecting a baby. We are delighted, it\u0027s amazing, and I know that the people who are already excited to see you will just be enthralled by the fact of this wonderful news.\u0027After thanking him Harry said: \u0027Thank you very much for having us and letting us stay in your wonderful house. And thank you very much for organising the weather! Let\u0027s hope the rain stays off!\u0027 The royal couple arrived on Monday on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, and touched down at Sydney Airport to be greeted by hundreds of supporters. Meghan, wearing skinny black pants and a black, burgundy trimmed coat, was smiling and clutching folders, while Harry gave a thumbs up to bystanders.The couple is due to spend a week in Australia, the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first ever trip Down Under, before jetting to Fiji on October 23 where they will spend two days.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31.The announcement of the pregnancy confirmed weeks of speculation from royal watchers about why Meghan was not joining Harry on his Sydney Harbour Bridge climb set for Friday.Sydney\u0027s weather is expected to be drizzly and cool on today, with showers forecast for most of the week.This won\u0027t be the first time Harry has had to brave the rain in Sydney. Last year, he made a whirlwind visit to cast his eye over the Invictus Games preparations, where he charmed his fans during torrential rain.The tour coincides with the games, which start in Sydney on Saturday. The sporting event, founded by Harry in 2014, gives sick and injured military personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball.Harry and Meghan will attend the games\u0027 opening and closing ceremonies. In all, they have 76 engagements scheduled over 16 days in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The royal couple\u0027s visit comes six months after Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, made his 16th official visit to Australia, primarily to open the 21st Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast city in Queensland.  \u0027He couldn\u0027t be happier\u0027: Prince Harry is an \u0027emotional wreck but in a good way\u0027 say insiders after he and Meghan announce they\u0027re expecting the baby \u0027he\u0027s wanted for a long time\u0027 By Rebecca EnglishPrince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an \u0027emotional wreck - but in a good way!\u0027 since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.\u0027It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn\u0027t be happier. He is so protective of her,\u0027 the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace yesterday after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.            Meghan walking out of Sydney Airport on Monday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced a day later They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week,Last night it emerged:Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was among the first to know - likely told in person when she visited London last month.Miss Ragland was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Meghan\u0027s estranged father Thomas Markle is \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 and told her by letter: \u0027You will make a great mother\u0027. Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether Meghan had told her father directly.The baby will be seventh in line to the throne and likely be titled Earl of Dumbarton or Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor unless the Queen bestows prince or princess on them.Moments after the baby announcement, Sarah Ferguson began tweeting a series of pictures from her daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding day last Friday – leading some to question if she felt upstaged.Meghan, 37, has \u0027just\u0027 had her 12-week scan, the Mail understands. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding.The joyous news sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who in recent years has made no secret of his desire to settle down and start a family.It is only 12 months since the couple stepped out together in public for the first time, when they appeared together at the Invictus Games in Toronto. At the time, Meghan was still living full-time in Canada, although preparing to move to London, and the couple were not even engaged.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, towards the end of July, conceived their first child.In mid-July, Harry and Meghan were on a \u0027mini-moon\u0027 royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.Yesterday a Kensington Palace spokesman said the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were all \u0027delighted for the couple\u0027.\u0027They were able to share their happy news with the Royal Family in person at Friday\u0027s wedding,\u0027 said an aide, which may have accounted for their low-key appearance at the nuptials.A friend added: \u0027They didn\u0027t make a grand announcement but had conversations with their family and friends and told them their news.\u0027Meghan is said to be in \u0027good health\u0027 and has not had to cancel any public appearances because of her pregnancy, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge who sadly suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a several form of pregnancy-related sickness.Her pregnancy is likely to be monitored closely, however, as by the age of 35 any woman expecting a baby is technically classed by doctors as a \u0027geriatric mother\u0027.The couple\u0027s tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga will be highly demanding. It includes opening the prince\u0027s inspirational Invictus Games for injured service personnel in Sydney later this week.Harry and Meghan have insisted their trip to the two most remote South Pacific islands will go ahead despite the risk of Zika there, which can cause abnormalities in foetuses. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises pregnant women to avoid \u0027all but essential travel\u0027 there.               Kensington Palace announced via Twitter on Monday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in the springA source told the Mail last night: \u0027It\u0027s early days but everything seem to be progressing well and there won\u0027t be changes to the Duchess\u0027s diary. She has a busy tour ahead of her.\u0027 It is believed one of the first to know about the pregnancy was Meghan\u0027s mother, whom friends suspect she told in person when she came to visit her in London last month.In a statement issued through Kensington Palace - no less - Miss Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Speculation has raged in recent months that the yoga teacher and geriatric therapist would move to London permanently to support her daughter - and now her grandchild too. It emerged she gave up her full-time role as a social worker in May, then last month she was spotted taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California, with reports in some international media claiming it was because Meghan does not want to hire a nanny.

Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab (pictured today) will play key roles in the unfolding Brexit drama between the UK and Brussels          Donald Tusk, pictured right with Michel Barnier in Brussels today, has warned that a no-deal Brexit is now \u0027more likely than ever before\u0027A No10 spokesman said every minister present contributed to the discussion, and no-one threatened to resign.  \u0027The Cabinet strongly supported the Prime Minister on the importance of maintaining the integrity of the union,\u0027 the spokesman said.\u0027It is very clear from the Prime Minister\u0027s Cabinet colleagues that on these two key points she has their strong support.\u0027However, while there were no explicit resignation threats, it is understood that ministers did voice disquiet about not including a hard end date in the UK\u0027s backstop plan.  The spokesman joked that ministers had not been offered pizza, but sausage, egg and bacon sandwiches were laid on.Speculation has been intensifying that Mrs May could face a confidence vote by Tory MPs unless she shifts her Brexit approach - with claims that the number of letters sent to 1922 committee chair Graham Brady has almost reached the threshold of 48 required to force one. However, even Brexiteers admit she would currently win such a vote if it was held.Meanwhile in Brussels, Mr Tusk said: \u0027Unfortunately the report on the state of the negotiation that I got from Michel Barnier today as well as yesterday\u0027s debate in the House of Commons gives me no grounds for optimism before tomorrow\u0027s European Council on Brexit.\u0027As I see it the only source of hope for a deal for now is the good will and determination on both sides. However for a breakthrough to take place despite good will, we need new facts.\u0027Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough through is possible.\u0027   Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, pictured left and right respectively arriving for Cabinet today, are believed to be concerned about concessions in the Brexit negotiationsSajid Javid (left) and Liz Truss were also among the ministers at the Cabinet meeting today          Chancellor Philip Hammond, pictured arriving at No10 today, has been pushing for a softer Brexit approach    Mrs May has been frantically ringing round fellow leaders including Emmanuel Macron (pictured) to appeal for a shift in their position          In the Commons last night, Boris Johnson pressed the PM on whether the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 would be time-limited           DUP leader Arlene Foster (pictured speaking with Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Bishop of Glendalough, Michael Jackson in  Dublin yesterday) has been demanding Mrs May holds to her red lines against anything that would split the UK "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/07/515A627000000578-0-image-a-78_1539669620792.jpg","title":"Beaming Doria Ragland spotted Los Angeles","story":"    Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about his lovely news\u0027 after it was confirmed that her daughter Meghan Markle is pregnant with her first childMeanwhile, daughter Meghan and Prince Harry thrilled thousands of fans outside the Sydney Opera House on Tuesday during their first meeting with the public since the newly announced pregnancy.The couple spent longer than the 20 minutes allocated in their schedule to speak to and shake hands with as many well-wishers as possible.She will make a great mom\u0027: Thomas Markle is \u0027excited\u0027 by...\u0027We\u0027re ready and excited to join the club!\u0027 Pregnant Meghan...Getting some practice in already!

If people are willing to volunteer their time they should be allowed to do so.\u0027I\u0027m sure there are lots of people around here who own flatbed trucks and trailers and would be kind enough to pull Santa\u0027s sleigh for a night..\u0027Resident Adam Maddison said: \u0027It\u0027s been a tradition for as long as I can remember. It would be such a shame if it was to stop and the new generation not see Santa in Aycliffe on Christmas Eve.\u0027But Great Aycliffe Town Council says its insurance would be void and the authority could face prosecution if it sticks to the tradition.Its events managers have received a report warning: \u0027One of the volunteers last year, a serving police officer, highlighted to a member of council staff that the law states, \u0027no person shall travel on the back of a moving vehicle\u0027.\u0027This is in reference to Road Traffic legislation and Health and Safety legislation.\u0027Drivers could be prosecuted and the council\u0027s insurance would be null and void, in the event of any accident resulting in a claim.\u0027Parents are heading for a showdown with council bosses when they meet to discuss what should happen on Wednesday night.Mr Gibson is planning to attend dressed up like Santa and has urged other protesters to wear fancy dress.The recommendation on the meeting agenda is, \u0027that the Santa Tour in its present format be replaced with the vehicles stopping in strategic locations throughout the parish for the public to come to visit Santa\u0027.Council leader Bob Fleming said: \u0027As well as breaking the law, there are insurance implications. It is not the case we are going to cancel the Santa Tour completely but obviously we can\u0027t continue with the current arrangement.\u0027    "},{"url":null,"title":"The Blue Peter canines household favourites TV screens","story":"    Peter Purves and Petra, the first Blue Peter dog and pet photographed in 1977.

How it\u0027s done: A microscopic image of a 4x6 millimeter part of Rembrandt\u0027s Night Watch is seen on a computer screen during the press conference A century later \u0027The Night Watch\u0027 underwent a series of attempts to \u0027regenerate\u0027 the varnish and remove its yellowish tint.Then in September 1939 the painting was evacuated from the Rijksmuseum along with 30,000 other artworks as Nazi Germany closed in. When it was returned from its last hiding place in a cave in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands in 1945 it needed major restoration. The painting\u0027s travails were not over: the 1975 attack saw a disturbed man slash the painting 12 times, with the marks of the deepest cuts still being visible today.The museum decided to carry out a major restoration then, only to see a man spray acid on it in 1990.Recently, however, new problems emerged.\u0027We noticed that over the past years there\u0027s a white glare that appeared on the bottom part of the painting. We want to be able to understand what that is,\u0027 said Dibbits.Restoring \u0027The Night Watch\u0027 will not be cheap, or quick, however.\u0027That will cost several millions,\u0027 said Dibbits, adding that the museum would also be looking for private funding. \u0027I\u0027m very confident people will want to contribute to it because we all want to restore it for future generations.\u0027After several months of research, \u0027The Night Watch\u0027 will be the centrepiece of an exhibition marking the 350th anniversary of Rembrandt\u0027s death starting in February 2019, before restoration work begins in full in July.\u0027As we say in Dutch, conserving paintings is a monk\u0027s job, it takes a lot of patience, so it might be several years,\u0027 said Dibbits. "},{"url":null,"title":"Bungling council accused wasting thousands pounds planted wrong palm trees","story":"    The four palm trees were planted outside the new Torre Abbey Sands flats development (pictured) in Torquay a few years ago.

One of the surviving palms will to be transferred to a nursery for replanting.\u0027To date, Torbay Council has not been responsible for the upkeep of the beds but on completion of the works, the local authority will take over the maintenance.\u0027          One regular visitor to the area has said the development (pictured) \u0027won\u0027t look the same without the palms\u0027. There are also concerns the replacement olive trees won\u0027t grow either The decision to remove them was met with dismay by many local residents and holidaymakers.Jane Davies said she was a regular visitor to the area and was not happy that palm trees were being dug up.She said: \u0027It just won\u0027t look the same without the Torquay Palms. They made the place look like you\u0027re abroad. I\u0027m devastated.\u0027Why don\u0027t the council consult Alan Titchmarsh - he did a garden in Torbay and used palm trees. He can\u0027t be wrong. I\u0027m fuming.\u0027Justin Kitley said the errors were a result of the wrong type of palms being planted.He added: \u0027Should have planted Torbay Palms in the first place.\u0027We know they thrive in our environment.\u0027And many people said that olive trees would be even less likely to thrive on the windswept seafront.Annette Lee said: \u0027Well that was a waste of money.

That way, you first take a trip through Anglo-Saxon England, past Celtic gold, Viking jewels and treasures from the burial of a seventh-century king. These artefacts, lurking in shadow, all date from a time that is often called the Dark Ages. Then you step out of that gallery and into a world of light.Streaming in through patterned screens and coloured glass, the light spills over lustreware, the glazed ceramics invented by medieval Islam that have an iridescent quality. Such luminous clarity seems to shine right through Islamic art: what you see here resembles the Enlightenment in 18th-century Europe – an age of reason that, in this case, started in the eighth century.I’m not trying to knock the west for the sake of it. It’s just that Islamic art soared to heights of mathematical sophistication and abstract calm at a time when the very appeal of European creations tended to lie in their savagery. The Sutton Hoo helmet is a glaring totem of primal power. By contrast, the first thing you see in the new Islamic gallery is a fresco portrait and a well-preserved carved wooden panelling from Samarra in Iraq. Dating from the ninth and 10th centuries respectively, they bear witness to a rich urban civilisation.It is not easy to convey in a museum the artistic glory of the lands converted and conquered by Islam from the 7th century onwards, from Egypt to Spain. Many of the most beautiful achievements of Islamic art are site-specific ensembles of architecture and decoration: the Ben Youssef Madrasa in Marrakech, the Alhambra in Granada. How can a museum convey the play of light and geometry that makes these so intoxicating with single tiles and fragments of pottery?The British Museum does it with state-of-the-art display cases perfectly spaced so that wherever you look there is something new to catch your eye, a subtle mix of natural and artificial light and, most of all, a clear thread of argument. Right from the start, we see how Islam forged its own aesthetic from a mixture of classical influences, religious imperatives and a scientific sensibility.In western Europe, the Roman empire was gone. In the east, however, it survived as Byzantium. A Byzantine marble capital (the decorated top of a column) carved with regularly spaced clusters of grapes and intertwining foliage shows how the playful, almost abstract transformation of nature into art in Rome and Byzantium gave Muslim artisans a model for an art of symmetry and pattern.The cliche that Islam forbids all representation is demolished: there are human as well as animal portraits throughout this gallery. But we do see how the abstract was preferred in mosques. And objects such as an astrolabe made in 1240 show how it was the Arab world that preserved and extended ancient Greek mathematics during the middle ages.All this comes together in the “arabesque” vision that flows through this gallery like the music of the spheres. From fine filigree metalwork to sumptuous Ottoman clothes, the same intricate system seems to join one object to another in an invisible network of cosmic connections. What western art historians would label the arabesque is an ordering of nature grounded in geometry. Images from the observed world – hares, trees, fruit – get absorbed into a precise yet complex and opulent structure that suggests the underlying laws of the universe. It is spiritual but it is also scientific.Tiles from 13th-century Iran show the full glory of this style. They are designed to tessellate intricately in a pattern of stars and crosses. Even removed from that overall geometrical splendour, each tile is a seductively intricate interlacing of plant stems and constellations of buds, with hares and leopards posing in the abstract forest. Tiles from 16th-century Istanbul show the same inner harmony, this time with bolder colours and a more extrovert fluidity of flowers.This gallery is a kind of miracle. It sees beyond inidual objects to grasp and communicate the principles and intellectual power that give Islamic art its infectious harmony and abundance. Yet it does that without oversimplifying. Within the continuity there are, it seems, inexhaustible details. The story of Islam is told chronologically down the centre of the L-shaped space with side cabinets that explore everything from the archaeology of lost cities to the distinctive footwear of the Ottoman empire. You can go into the biography of Timur – the conqueror known in the west as Tamburlaine – or the technology of glazed ceramics.There is far too much to explore in one review, but then, this is not an exhibition to get a ticket for and see once. It is part of the museum’s permanent displays. To me, it feels like a pivot of those displays, relating world history’s lines of influence and exchange in an arabesque that flows through time, connecting continents, making their interdependence as clear as a fountain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a89a9d23d317c22304157057d4fd0aa8d16a8e/0_314_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3904043bd23cbbdc3df5e2c7985de5","title":"david goldblatts photographs documenting the casual horror of apartheid south africa","story":"Goldblatt’s photographs capture the understated unease of living an ordinary life in a society that was anything but normalThe photograph makes me squirm. Four young women, cling-wrapped in awkward swimsuits and perched on high heels, stand on display. One smirks, the other three look unsure. They clutch their competition numbers and present their naked white legs for consideration by the unseen judges.Behind the stage, a crowd of mostly women and children cluster around the elevated stage, their faces resigned or perplexed. Dotted among the crowd, a few white men stare blankly, appraising the women’s bodies, while the only black man frowns. Most people seem bemused by the uncomfortable spectacle taking place in their local supermarket. Outside the frame, shoppers push their trolleys through the aisles, taking toilet paper and bread rolls and washing powder off the shelves.It makes me shudder because David Goldblatt took the photograph “Saturday Morning at the Hypermarket: Miss Lovely Legs Competition” at the supermarket where my mother shopped when I was a child growing up in South Africa. And if my seven-year-old self wasn’t there on that day in 1980, I probably was later that week.In itself, the image is ordinary. Like many of Goldblatt’s photographs, it isn’t dramatic, the subjects unknown. But it shows the casualness of a society separated by apartheid. It captures the uneasiness that pulsed through my childhood growing up in South Africa. It recalls things I saw but did not see. And it drags up the old questions that lurk beneath my memories – how could such ordinariness take place while countless horrors were happening off camera?The image will be among many in the exhibition David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948–2018 at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art over the summer. The vast exhibition, which was planned and curated before the late South African photographer died in June this year, will include his earliest work, his later portraits of miners, of Afrikaners, of exhausted early morning commuters and those affected by Aids, as well as his numerous landscapes of meaning-laden buildings and the lumbering mines that built the fortunes of the white ruling class thanks to black labourers. Most are in black and white – Goldblatt famously said “Colour was too sweet for apartheid” – and capture seven decades of a country and people ided by racism.Goldblatt didn’t see himself as an artist. As he told the Australian’s Tim Douglas in his last interview: “I am a photographer. I don’t hold exhibitions to glorify my artistic skill. These things I capture in my work are real. I photograph things that are important to me and to ­society. I want the pictures to be seen, because I want the message to be heard. But I’m not in the slightest bit interested in art and the glorification of art for art’s sake. It means nothing to me. I couldn’t give a fuck.”Instead he saw himself as a documentarian. When asked, he explained the purpose of his photographs to his friend and colleague Paul Weinberg: “I was asking myself how it was possible to be so apparently normal, moral, upright – which almost all those citizens were – in such an appallingly abnormal, immoral, bizarre situation. I hoped we would see ourselves revealed by a mirror held up to ourselves.”There is no violence in Goldblatt’s photograph – no schoolchildren fleeing police gunfire on the Soweto streets no bodies strewn on the ground after the Sharpeville massacre. Just everyday life. Goldblatt wasn’t interested in those sort of images he described himself as a coward who would “run away from violence”.Like all South Africans, my family experienced violent crime: my only uncle was murdered in a burglary gone wrong, a 16-year-old neighbour raped and murdered, our home burgled three times. None of these crimes made the headlines, none were exceptional – in fact we would be considered relatively fortunate. But as I stare at the faces in this series, I feel the same old prickling of fear – and the same need to understand. These are the people that committed the terrors that haunt me and they look so ordinary. Like many in South Africa, they aren’t monsters they’re just people who did appalling things.I haven’t been back to South Africa for more than 20 years. The country has moved on in vast leaps but, in my mind’s eye, much of it is frozen in its horribleness, its racism, its misogyny, just like one of Goldblatt’s pictures.But the photographs are also a powerful reminder that while ordinary people went about their daily lives, atrocities were committed and excused in their name. They are a warning that awful things happen on a normal day.• David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948-2018 exhibition will be on at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art Australia from 19 October 2018 to 3 March 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1cf37abafafc6c6298b5fc0d6adfab61df9478/0_681_1882_1129/master/1882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28c32d73df0657256976a391689148e6","title":"david goldblatt and the everyday reality of south african racism in pictures","story":"David Goldblatt considered himself a documentarian rather than an artist, and the central concern of his work was apartheid.

Second only to the magnificent Lucky Jim for laughs.On the subject of rereading, bobthekelpie has had an interesting experience with “an old favourite that I periodically reread”, The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown:What I did not realise until I started reading my daughter’s copy, is that the version I loved as a child, that I have faithfully reread all these years, was heavily abridged. OMG MIND BLOWN.So I’m now reading an old, but wonderfully new and better version of one of my favourite books.Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel is “an amazing, amusing, informative book” according to Dogbertd, who has to be quoted in full:I’m really glad I stumped up for the hardback because the pictures are (naturally) an integral and important part of the book, and you’ll want time to examine them closely. Hamel is an engaging and amusing guide to 12 of the most precious books written in Europe in the period before Gutenberg made print accessible to all.Hamel uses the same method throughout. First, a description of where the book is housed – along with sometimes caustic comments on his experience of getting his hands on the books – he hates those white gloves you’re sometimes forced to wear, but he loves the librarian in St Petersburg who gives him chocolates to eat as he’s perusing a 15th-century manuscript. Then he describes the book itself, pointing out the most interesting features: it’s like having the the best tour guide in the world at your side – in one book on the Apocalypse he notes that the Antichrist has had his face scratched out by an outraged reader – as has the Whore of Babylon (serves her right, he says). He then expounds on the history of the book and the sometimes murky routes it has taken to its current resting place.Along the way you’ll learn what a Psalter or Book of Hours is, why many manuscripts have pictures of cats playing viols (and it’s not because of the connection to catgut) and why the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury both bowed down before de Hamel.It’s a superb book if you love books and history, the Middle Ages, literature and art.Here’s a brave admission from NorthernSceptic:No doubt. Meanwhile, Grumpywoman56 recommends A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman by Margaret Drabble:It’s a collection of short stories and I’m really enjoying it. She eloquently expresses the hidden thoughts (even to themselves) of women. They were written in the 70s but it could apply to today’s society. It’s spurred me on to read more of her work.I needed something light-hearted and his equal parts interesting and amusing style is perfect. The only trouble is, I’ve read nearly 250 pages since Sunday night so I’ll need to find something else by the end of the week …How about Émile Zola’s The Beast Within? It has grabbed beingsentient:Tolstoy’s War and Peace has won over FrogC:I am reading War and Peace for the first time, at the age of 61. Only about 200 pages to go now. It is extraordinary, and there is no other novel like it. All the same, the essays on history, where Tolstoy forgets his characters for a few chapters and just rants about the errors of historians, are very strange, and one is inclined to think a novelist can’t do that. The only reason he gets away with it is that there is so much else going on at the same time.And tericheri adds of the same epic novel:That’s what I call a good read. The rest are mere trifles.All of them?!Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Another new service is called the Shopping List, under which a member of John Lewis’s team can be booked free of charge to gather either a specific basket of items or to help pick out gifts for specific people.Peter Cross, director of customer experience, said: “Previously the reserve of exclusive boutiques for the famous few, this autumn in Cheltenham, with the help of our army of expertly trained partners, we are bringing the intimacy, luxury and magic of personal shopping to the high street.”John Lewis – which is owned by its staff, known as partners – is trying to fight the flight to online shopping by offering a growing array of services that can’t be delivered via the internet.The managing director, Paula Nickolds, has said its stores needed to sell experiences to fight for a slice of discretionary consumer spending against mini-breaks, gym classes and nights out.She has brought in experience desks where a concierge helps book appointments for blowdrys, manicures and personal shopping services, which are now hosted in an increasing number of stores.Cheltenham will also have a personal shopping suite, including the group’s first lounge dedicated to men.The chain also recently rebranded to add “\u0026amp Partners” to its name, in a bid to emphasise the importance of the service offered by its staff, who all get a bonus based on profits at the end of the year.All department stores are under pressure because their large premises and typically lengthy rent deals with landlords have made it difficult to adapt to a fall in the number of shoppers visiting the high street.House of Fraser is closing stores after being rescued from administration by Sports Direct, while the Debenhams share price has slumped after a string of profit warnings.John Lewis’s profits have also taken a battering as it has been forced to match its ailing rivals’ discounts under its “never knowingly undersold” policy. It has also spent millions of pounds on improving its home delivery infrastructure and IT systems to cater to demand for online shopping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c34af73d7749d00c4d5d69a3125cc996b5fa5c/0_28_3152_1891/master/3152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=197498e09c6fd1ebca31a89ce5e01d0b","title":"sainsburys asda inquiry sale petrol toys kids clothes cma","story":"CMA highlights areas it will cover in merger of UK’s second and third largest supermarketsThe competition watchdog has announced that, in addition to groceries, its inquiry into Sainsbury’s planned buyout of Asda will examine the sale of petrol, toys, school uniforms and small kitchen appliances.The extent to which fast-growing discount chains Aldi and Lidl act as “close alternatives” to the two traditional grocers will also be considered by the Competition and Markets Authority, according to a statement outlining the major issues it is considering in relation to the £10bn merger of the UK’s second and third largest supermarkets.Stuart McIntosh, the chair of the independent inquiry group carrying out the in-depth investigation, said: “Millions of people shop at Asda and Sainsbury’s every week, so it is essential we carry out a thorough investigation into their proposed merger. Our job is to find out whether the merger will result in people paying more or being faced with less choice or a poorer-quality shopping experience.”The CMA has already begun surveying shoppers and will also ask retailers, suppliers and other interested parties for their views on the merger, including whether discounters now provide a sufficient competitive threat to prevent a merged Sainsbury’s and Asda putting up prices or reducing the quality of their groceries in large stores.Previous inquiries have only considered discounters as major competitors to convenience stores and small supermarkets. In the statement published on Tuesday, the CMA made clear it was prepared to reassess that position.It will also look at the plans for expansion by online players, such as Ocado and Amazon, which deliver groceries straight to shoppers’ homes, and how competition from these newer rivals might evolve.Sainsbury’s and Asda are hoping that the CMA will upgrade its view of the threat from discounters and online rivals, where an increasing number of families now buy their weekly shop, as that is likely to reduce the number of stores they will be forced to offload in order to gain approval for the deal.Last month, the CMA identified 463 places where the merged group might have to offload stores as there was a “realistic prospect of a significant lessening of competition” where the supermarkets’ catchment areas overlapped.That initial analysis of the effect of the merger only took into account potential overlap between the two chains’ medium-sized and largest stores, and those of their four traditional rivals. It said a more detail assessment, including a look at the role of the discounters, would be a matter for the “phase two” investigation, which is now under way.Aside from groceries, the CMA said the latest phase of its inquiry would look closely at the market for toys, children’s clothing – especially school uniforms – and small electrical appliances such as toasters or shavers because it said that Sainsbury’s and Asda controlled a large portion of sales in those categories.The companies have previously said major suppliers will have to bear the brunt of a pledge to reduce the price of everyday products after their merger.A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s and Asda said: “We recognise that this is an important merger and welcome the detailed and thorough review by the CMA. We look forward to working constructively with the CMA and inquiry panel during this second phase of the process and to making our case that the proposed merger is pro-competitive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d7fe0d5138d4f9c8d8179ac8c5953ed22d7d21/85_496_5329_3198/master/5329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c6bcab32977110bb86d142f9cf96f45","title":"scottish power wind drax sale uk energy firms","story":"Big six energy firm drops fossil fuels for generation and say cheap green energy is the futureIberdrola, Scottish Power’s Spanish parent company, said the move was part of its strategy to tackle climate change and would free it up to invest in renewables and power grids in the UK.The deal also marks a significant expansion and ersification for Drax, whose main business is a coal- and biomass-fired power station in North Yorkshire.Included in the £702m sale are four gas power stations in England, two hydro schemes and a pumped storage plant in Scotland. That leaves Scottish Power producing all its power from windfarms.While it has many onshore, the firm’s growth is in offshore windfarms, including East Anglia One, which should take the crown of the world’s largest when it opens in 2020.However, the company’s 5 million domestic customers will still be supplied with a mix of green and brown electricity, with some bought from other coal and gas power plant operators.The ScottishPower chief executive, Keith Anderson, said: “We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.”Asked why the firm was selling off its hydro assets too, given they generate green energy, he said that it was partly because they were in the same company as the gas plants and made the sale simpler.But it was also because investment in new hydro was a “difficult, complex and slow process” compared to wind and solar, Anderson said.Drax will see an immediate boost in its earnings, adding an estimated £90m-£110m profit in 2019. The company made a profit of £229m in 2017.The acquisition positions Drax as a key player to fill in the gaps in the UK energy system at times when solar and wind power output is low.It also means that if the company fails to secure the subsidies needed for the new gas power station it wants to build at its North Yorkshire site then it will still have a broad portfolio.The chief executive of Drax Group, Will Gardiner, said: “As the system transitions towards renewable technologies, the demand for flexible, secure energy sources is set to grow. We believe there is a compelling logic in our move.”He added that the deal was “much more about the water than the gas”. While the gas plants were relatively old and would therefore be beaten out of the market as and when new gas plants get built, the hydro plants would keep “running for a long time”, he said.But the four gas plants acquired by Drax, in Kent, Hertfordshire, Sussex and Lancashire, also give the company what Gardiner called “attractive options” to build further new gas units, if it can make the economics work.Industry watchers said they thought Drax had paid a high price for the power stations. Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein, said the £702m was “significantly higher” than what it valued the portfolio.Green groups said the deal showed the government should back renewable energy firms rather than fossil fuel and nuclear companies.Kate Blagojevic, head of energy at Greenpeace UK said: “Big utilities across Europe have been shedding their dirty fossil fuel infrastructure because it makes economic and environmental sense.”The deal is due to complete at the end of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/287d02bb6f054ab6c0158fcb2a7da3c351577116/44_16_1407_1455/master/1407.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dca7e43d258cf6178caad6d312beca91 1760w","title":"antarctic ocean sanctuary climate change javier bardem","story":"The ocean is threatened by climate change, pollution and fishing. I urge world leaders to agree to establish a sanctuaryI thought it would be cold. Not just cold, but colder than anything I had experienced in my life. I had visions of bedraggled explorers in blizzards with ice-covered beards.But standing there, in the bright Antarctic sun, watching creaking blue icebergs, penguins bursting in and out of the water, I felt utterly content in this glistening wilderness.What I hadn’t thought about was the dark. And not the dark of night – although as a European, that brought a dazzling new astronomy of the southern hemisphere to me – but the dark of the deep, icy, ocean depths. I was going almost half a kilometre down to the Antarctic seafloor.It was back in January of this year, and I had joined a Greenpeace research expedition as part of a campaign to create a vast Antarctic ocean sanctuary. At 1.8m square kilometres, it would be five times the size of Germany. If it’s created, which it could be when governments meet in the next few weeks, it would be the largest protected area anywhere on Earth. I am one of two million people who want it to happen.Scientists on the ship were using tiny submersibles to go where humans had never been before to explore ecosystems we know so little about: deep habitats they had been looking at on screens all their working lives but had never seen with their own eyes. The excitement was more arresting than the cold of the Antarctic summer.So there I was, descending, in a small, two-person submarine to the frontiers of human knowledge. The light faded, and the sea around us turned a heavy blue. As we sank to hundreds of metres below the surface, I was surrounded by a thick blackness. It was a colour that I had no idea the ocean could turn. Pitch black.A torch at the front of the submarine shone like a night-light for a child afraid of the dark. It showed the way to the seabed.The sight as it came into view was staggering. Out of the dark and freezing depths emerged a moving, crawling, vibrant mass of life.The temperature is so low that vegetation barely survives down here. Nearly everything is an animal: bizarre and ghostly icefish that are semi-transparent sea spiders that look like something out of a science-fiction film colourful, tendrilled, feather stars, basket stars, corals, sponges.I’m told that more people have been to the moon than have been to the bottom of the Antarctic ocean. Maybe that’s apocryphal, but it certainly feels like it. We know precious little about this alien environment, which is why it is so crucial to protect it before it is too late.Emerging back into the light at the surface, the bubbles of the submarine hull clearing, it was like waking from a dream, the intangible creatures of the abyss left far behind.I had truly seen the light and the dark of the Antarctic. At its surface, penguin colonies stretch for miles on snow-capped islands, with millions of breeding pairs across the region, raising their chicks in this inhospitable environment. Enormous whales surface all around, feeding on huge pink clouds of the small shrimp-like krill, which nearly all wildlife here relies on. Fur seals and elephant seals lounge on drifting blocks of ice. While below, another world goes on existing in dark vitality.So often, we lament the destruction of the environment once it has taken place. And it is true that wildlife in the Antarctic is facing threats from climate change, pollution and industrial fishing. But this area still remains one of the least-touched regions on the planet.Right now, we have an opportunity to protect this place. The governments responsible for conservation of the Antarctic’s waters meet in Hobart, Australia, in the second half of October. What better conservation of the Antarctic ocean could there be than the creation of the largest protected area on Earth at its heart, in the Weddell sea. It would put the area off-limits to future human activity, protect wildlife such as penguins, seals and whales, and help to tackle climate change.I am proud to stand as one person in a movement of more than two million that has come together this year to demand world leaders protect the Antarctic.Most of these people will never visit the Antarctic, but their passion for protecting it inspires me. Across the world, people have written to their politicians they have encouraged their friends and family to take action they have dressed up as penguins and danced on ice to raise awareness from the streets of Buenos Aires to Beijing they have installed penguin sculptures from Johannesburg to Seoul. This is a global movement for a region that belongs to us all.Now, as governments prepare to meet at the Antarctic ocean commission there are millions of eyes watching them and urging them to act. To secure the Antarctic for future generations. To allow its abundance of wildlife to flourish and its migratory species to thrive between the world’s oceans. To help create healthy oceans that contribute to global food security. To preserve the Antarctic ocean’s functions as one of the world’s largest carbon stores. Because, truly, what happens in the Antarctic affects us all.• Javier Bardem is an Oscar-winning actor and an Antarctic ambassador for Greenpeace"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/557035c2211d46185b6567c3eb2f946179e1f0be/0_251_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc2658459de010e2bfcdf1c8425013ae","title":"climbdown universal credit benefit claimants poverty","story":"The proposed changes are a move in the right direction, but still risk pushing benefit claimants deeper into poverty• Universal credit rollout may be delayed again amid Tory backlashThe budget battle lines have been drawn between the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and millions of people on low incomes.Within hours of ministers taking a pasting from MPs over the rollout of universal credit, a document was leaked with a raft of proposed changes to the design and delivery of the benefit. It was hardly a coincidence, so hopefully the DWP is trying to rally support behind this reform package, in an attempt to counter Treasury resistance and gain the additional funding it will need to implement the changes.But how much of an impact would these changes have on claimants’ living standards, and particularly those of the poorest? Not much. On first glance, while they represent a move in the right direction, that movement is far from complete. The minimum terms that need to be met, before the rollout of universal credit can continue without pushing families deeper into poverty, would not be met in full by these changes.First, the DWP is planning to extend the payment of some benefits – income support, jobseeker’s allowance, and employment and support allowance – for two weeks after a claim for universal credit has been made. A failsafe move must be to extend these existing benefits right up to when a universal credit claim is in payment.Third, there may be some movement to protect the living standards of low earners in self-employment. The work and pensions committee has drawn up minimum terms of support for this vulnerable section of the workforce. Anything that falls short of those terms would again leave too many self-employed people at risk of financial ruin.Likewise, the DWP must ensure that working parents who are eligible for childcare get that payment upfront, and that low-paid workers who are paid weekly, fortnightly or on a fluctuating basis through a zero-hours contract are protected. And it must guarantee that no disabled claimants are worse off – through the loss of severe disability premium, for example – once they have moved safely on to universal credit.Perhaps the most crucial change mooted in the leaked document is a further delay to the migration of millions of claimants from their existing benefits on to universal credit. The DWP must use this window of opportunity to introduce further reform.In particular, it must address the rigidity of the system itself, perhaps through the creation of a citizens’ bank, so that people who manage on a daily or weekly basis, or need to share payments between different members of the household, can draw universal credit payments down in a manner that reflects the way they live, work and save. Anything less risks further destroying their living standards. As a women’s organisation in Birkenhead recently explained to me, and I relayed to the House of Commons on Monday, universal credit has now become the main reason for some women having to work on the street.• Frank Field is Labour MP for Birkenhead and chair of the Commons work and pensions committee"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d97851ddfe6a3d797b81294fe157d75dc033d571/29_434_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a32e8b41d1224d418f20e5d3b5b88e21","title":"piers morgan james bond baby sling daniel craig 007","story":"Responding to a Piers Morgan tweet is always a bad idea, because it’s exactly what he wants. The man spends his entire life spurting all manner of convictionless takes up into the atmosphere, purely because he gets to gleefully slurp up all the negative energy they create, like a donkey trying to get the last drop of custard from the trough.But sometimes it’s unavoidable. Sometimes the deafening crack of Piers Morgan’s brittle masculinity is too loud for even the most stoic among us to ignore. And so it was yesterday, when Morgan tweeted a picture of Daniel Craig carrying his newborn baby in a sling, hooting: “Oh 007.. not you as well?!!! #papoose #emasculatedBond” in accompaniment.Now, there’s quite a lot to unpack here. It’s probably best for everyone if I just did a numbered list of my grievances.1. James Bond is an alcoholic rapist in a girdle. Maybe let’s not use him as a role model for our parenting ideals, eh?2. Also, that isn’t James Bond, Piers. That’s Daniel Craig, an actor who plays James Bond in some films. This misunderstanding of the basic concept of fiction is nothing less than tragic. If you ever see Piers Morgan on the street, yelling at a car because it won’t change into a Transformer, please don’t be scared. Give him a hot drink, put a blanket around his shoulders and call his carer, Susanna Reid.3. James Bond would totally wear a baby sling. Let’s break this one down into subsections:a) James Bond drives around in impractical cars that almost definitely don’t have Isofix connections fitted to the backseat as standard, so it’s not like he can drive his kids around.b) James Bond wouldn’t push his baby about in a pram either, because he’d have to park it and leave it somewhere safe whenever he wanted to do any of that tinpot bullshit body-double parkour that he’s suddenly really into, which would be a faff.c) With a baby attached safely to his chest, James Bond could quite easily perform most of the nonsense he’s famous for. Getting blackout drunk, murdering people, being genuinely horrible to women, going yellowface for a laugh, that sort of thing. In fact, the only behaviour that a sling might prohibit is getting naked and forcing himself on people while they are in the shower, like he did in Skyfall. But, you know, that might not be such a bad thing.4. I’ve worn a sling with both of my kids. And they are honestly the greatest. Not only do they give you a much smaller footprint than a buggy – which means you can easily take them on public transport – but they fold down to nothing, and the warmth of your body makes your kids instantly go to sleep. They’re an invention that Q would be proud of, except that they weren’t created for the express purpose of murdering foreigners.5. Plus, it’s just like wearing a weighted vest if you’re fragile enough about your masculinity to have to rationalise this sort of thing that desperately.Additionally, you will never be surrounded by more adoring women than the first time you take a baby out in a sling, if you’re so fragile about your masculinity that you need to maintain a direct psychic link between your baby and your genitals for some reason.6. From a subsequent tweet, it appears that Piers Morgan would prefer it if dads carried their kids around on their shoulders instead.  Daniel Craig’s daughter is one month old, and lacks the strength to hold her own head upright. If he put her on his shoulders she’d flop about like a rag doll and he’d definitely be in prison for it.7. And anyway, real men can do both at once. 8. Piers Morgan doesn’t mean it. Piers Morgan doesn’t mean anything he says. He’s made his living as a hip-shooting contrarian and now he’s trapped there, formulating and farting out increasingly desperate takes to buoy up the notoriety that’s been waning ever since he traded CNN for an ITV breakfast show. He can’t ever say anything nice about anything, even though he’s probably perfectly decent in person, because then he wouldn’t get any clicks. Clicks, all the time, no matter what, give him clicks, wonderful clicks, more clicks, in exchange for his soul. What I’m trying to say is that Piers Morgan is Click Gollum.• Stuart Heritage writes about film, TV and music for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1da896c4a4a85091deb502fd84b01aa21bfc72/0_253_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd239580e6481217764eb1bf4254626","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of yellow","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘yellow’The closing date is Wednesday 17 October September at 10am.

Ask the people who live there …Cleopatra Browne, founder of Celtic Quest Coasteering I’ve visited many coastal destinations across the globe, but nothing compares to Wales’s wet and wild coastline. The rock formations, sandy beaches, sheer cliff faces, Atlantic swell and abundance of marine life are all world-class.When the sea is rough, the coastline is truly wild, with waves crashing along the cliffs or rolling into the sandy beaches. When calm, the stunning glassy ocean allows us to explore caves and hidden coves. Then there are the people – Pembrokeshire folk are extremely welcoming. I love learning about the history of our little stretch of paradise from locals.My outdoor career began 20 years ago at a multi-activity centre on the Pembrokeshire coast, where I gained experience in kayaking, surfing, climbing and ing. Coasteering was by far my favourite – it is often described as extreme rock pooling. You explore a stretch of coastline at sea level, traversing the rocky shore, adventure swimming, cliff jumping, exploring caves and more. I saw an opportunity to offer the activity to everybody – not just outdoor enthusiasts. We tailor the experience to the expectations and abilities of each inidual. Being able to swim helps but is not essential as the safety equipment can do the floating for you.What’s great about coasteering is that participants can get up close and personal with the coastline without the need for boats, boards or ropes. All that is required is a wetsuit, a buoyancy aid and a helmet – as well a sense of adventure and a guide with a good splash of local knowledge. Then you’re set for hours of fun.Wales has a reputation for wet weather, but seeing as you can’t get much wetter than when jumping from cliffs into the Celtic Sea, that doesn’t put a stop to our activities. That said, the Welsh coastline is stunning in the sunshine. Looking down from the Wales Coast Path over the crystal-clear waters, visitors often remark that their visit has exceeded expectations.All of our adventures finish in the Blue Lagoon, an old slate quarry flooded by the sea. Its waters are 25 metres deep and the cliffs climb 30 metres above. If you park at Abereiddi beach, the lagoon is a short walk along the coast path – it’s the location of the World Series Cliff Diving competition, and truly is a stunning spot.Cwm-yr-Eglwys between Fishguard and Newport is another favourite, also off the beaten track. A secluded cove with clear blue water, it’s perfect for snorkelling, kayaking and standup paddle boarding.Wales is a truly world-class adventure destination, which offers just about every activity you can imagine.Catherine Williams, operations manager at Snowdonia-ActiveGrowing up near the Peak District, I developed a love of exploring the outdoors. But because the area is landlocked, with the nearest coast more than two hours away, I chose to do my degree in north Wales to satisfy my love of the mountains and desire to be close to the sea.My academic background is in psychology, and my master’s degree investigated the mutually beneficial relationship between people and nature. This led me to my role at Snowdonia-Active, where we fully believe in and promote the benefits of spending time being active outdoors.The Welsh coast is a mecca for outdoor activities, and home to some of the most beautiful coastline in the world. I’ve lived here for 12 years and I’m still finding new coastal spots that amaze and inspire me. It’s super accessible and on the doorstep to the mountains – I can’t think of many places in the world where you can spend the morning in the mountains and the afternoon by the coast.I have three favourite spots. My must-do activity is coasteering on Anglesey – an activity that involves scrambling, climbing, jumping and swimming your way around the coast. I’ve recently had a little girl, so I’m seeking some softer adventures at the moment too, such as exploring the hidden coves at Borth y Gest near Porthmadog and dipping our toes in the sea. I also love Rhoscolyn Beach for sea kayaking, followed by a glass of wine at the White Eagle – a favourite with William and Kate when they lived in Anglesey.With a place as special as Snowdonia, it is vital to promote quiet enjoyment through recreation, as we do at Snowdonia-Active. Wales is leading the way in this area, with wildlife and conservation organisations working and the outdoor sector collaborating on education, wildlife monitoring and practical conservation projects. Whether you want quiet coves, busy beaches, clifftop walks, climbing, wildlife spotting or simply to hang out in a beer garden with an incredible sea view, the Welsh coast has it.Phil Scott, founder of RibRide I’ve lived in north Wales since 1991, apart from an eight-year stint in the Caribbean. I’m passionate about watersports: sailing and Ribs (rigid-hulled inflatable boats), windsurfing and kite-surfing. I also love running and mountain biking.North Wales is simply the best location in the UK to enjoy these sports at a high level in a stunning environment. I feel so lucky to live here and be bringing up my family to enjoy the unique culture and opportunities.After returning to north Wales from the Virgin Islands where I was skippered a luxury yacht, my business partner and I invested in a Rib to start RibRide, the first adventure boat tour company in north Wales. We now have 11 boats, a storage yard, a training academy, six full-time staff and an award-winning track record – we are listed as the top outdoor activity provider in Wales on TripAdvisor.The region has one of the largest tidal ranges in the UK, and one of the longest tidal estuaries, the Menai Strait, which causes one of the fastest tidal currents. People think the Menai Strait is a dangerous stretch of water, but it’s actually one of the most sheltered, user-friendly locations there is as long as you have the right knowledge and experience.An ideal day for me would be a visit to the Marram Grass restaurant in Newborough with a short walk to the Roman stepping stones and the home of Maurice Wilks, the original designer of the Land Rover – followed by a two-mile walk to Newborough Beach over one of the largest sand dune systems in the UK.With its assorted beaches, cliffs, islands and coastal paths, north Wales is one of the most peaceful, soulful, relaxing and energising places you will ever find.Adventure holidays across Wales are made for all ages and abilities.

From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

Forty years later, she toured the area with her teenage daughter. Is it still as enchanting? Back in the 1970s, a good 20 years before the advent of low-cost airlines made short European breaks as cheap as a trip to the local seaside, my family made regular jaunts to an Italian village that was only two hours, door to door, from our home in Manchester. The place was the height of exotica: it had a campanile and a pantheon, palm trees and fountains, a cluster of brightly painted houses on the clifftop overlooking the lagoon, and the locals spoke another language. Only the weather punctured the illusion that we were on the Italian Riviera or the Amalfi coast because we were, in fact, in Wales.But in my memory the sun often shone in Portmeirion: and when I returned last month with my teenage daughter, to show her where I spent so many holidays, there was sunshine again (some of the time). My daughter, it’s fair to say, was sceptical about our expedition. Holidays for her tend to begin with a short train ride from our house in south London to Gatwick this one started with a five-hour drive through a cloudy Wales. But when we reached Snowdonia the clouds lifted, the day brightened, and suddenly Catriona was being wowed by vistas of green and blue mountains, fields full of sheep and cows, and tantalising glimpses of lakes. There were occasional animals on the roads, but hardly any other cars.We breezed into Portmeirion, crossing the threshold I remember so well into the magical kingdom founded by architect Clough Williams-Ellis in the 1920s. Williams-Ellis was an eccentric who first started to dream of setting up the place as a child of five or six, before going searching for the perfect island on which to site it in the early 1920s. But no island seemed quite right and then he discovered a rocky promontory outside Porthmadog, and set to work. First came Hotel Portmeirion, which opened in 1926 across the years that followed came the gatehouse and the battery, the prior’s lodging and the campanile, the roundhouse, and pastel-coloured cottages with names such as Dolphin and Angel. As the place grew, its fame expanded, and it soon became the “It” location for A-listers such as George Bernard Shaw, Daphne du Maurier and HG Wells. Noel Coward came here to write Blithe Spirit part of the Inn of Sixth Happiness, with Ingrid Bergman, was filmed in Portmeirion’s pagodas and it was the Village in the 1960s cult series The Prisoner, alongside Patrick McGoohan, who starred as “Number Six”. But topping all this, for Williams-Ellis himself, was the visit of Frank Lloyd Wright, who declared its creator a true architect.The village today is exactly as I remember it, with the delicious addition of an Italian gelateria Catriona thought that it was like a more upmarket and colourful Center Parcs, set by the waves rather than among trees. We ate focaccia laced with Anglesey salt and feasted on the tenderest assiette of Welsh lamb with shallots and turnips in the opulent dining room of the main hotel, beside a bank of windows overlooking the estuary, before wandering up the hill to our room in Castell Deudraeth, neglected during my childhood but now reinvented as a cooler and more laid-back version of its big sister by the shore.Day trippers are welcome at Portmeirion, but part of the enchantment if you’re staying is to see the village empty of visitors, either at first light or when it’s floodlit. By day we headed off to explore north Wales beyond Portmeirion: and first stop was the station at Porthmadog, meeting point of two narrow-gauge heritage railways, the Ffestiniog and the Welsh Highland lines. We opted for the latter, and as we chugged through the countryside wrapped in billowing steam I was transported back 40 years. “This is exactly how it was when I was young,” I told Catriona and to my surprise (because this was not the sunniest moment of our trip) she said she was loving it too. By this time she had discovered that Snowdonia has the fastest zip wire in the world, and was begging me to book our next holiday here as we couldn’t fit it in on this visit. First, though, there was Beddgelert to explore, eight miles and 40 minutes down the line from Porthmadog: it’s a picture postcard village named after the grave of a dog called Gelert, hound of one Prince Llewelyn who, the story goes, killed it after mistakenly blaming it for mauling his son. In fact, the dog had fought off a wolf trying to do just that when the stricken Llewelyn realised his mistake he rushed back to his faithful friend, who gamely licked his hand with its final breath. A brilliant story, agreed Catriona with tears in her eyes, even if it’s more likely to be folklore than truth.Our final stop was Criccieth, where we wandered along the beach at dusk, enjoying the views of the 13th-century castle that sits on a hillside high above it. Lloyd George, though born in Manchester, is the local hero, as he spent his childhood from 1864 to 1880 in a house that’s now a museum: you can see the future prime minister’s school desk, and the workshop where his uncle made shoes.Criccieth has the feel of a fairly traditional Welsh seaside town, but its dining scene is pukka 21st century since the reopening of a sweeping art-deco-style glass-fronted building designed by Williams-Ellis and used in the 1950s for tea dances. Today, we’re eating at Dylan’s, one of a trio of seaside restaurants specialising in local food and a neighbourly conscience: there’s a sign advertising the next beach clean-up at the gate, recycled plastic bottles have been turned into a stunning fish mosaic above the entrance, and the menu features mussels from the Menai Strait and lobster from Morfa Nefyn across the peninsula. And while the food might be local, the vibe is unashamedly big city hustle and bustle – a perfect combination, as far as my teenage daughter was concerned.For inspiration to plan your break in Wales check out visitwales"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

School budgets are shot, which led to an unprecedented protest by headteachers. Teacher retention is at a record low and the government has missed all recruitment targets for five years. Secondary school places are in short supply. And yet, in a recent survey of more than 2,500 teachers, fewer than half said they would vote Labour if an election were called tomorrow.So, what is Labour’s problem? The so-called National Education Service is the linchpin of the party’s planned fightback – but no one knows what it means. In part, that’s because Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, isn’t being allowed to develop it properly.Over the summer she ran a series of public meetings to work out the details of the policy. Everywhere she went, Corbyn would turn up – shaking hands, kissing babies. It’s hard for Rayner to run a serious policy forum when participants are queuing up for selfies with Corbyn. To some of us, it looked like a panicked leader worried by the growing popularity of a junior.On top of this, Rayner has other issues to contend with: John McDonnell promising bizarre things, such as refusing to pay the private companies who run some school buildings (good luck with the legals on that) the financial burden of Corbyn’s promise to make university free (seen by many as an enormous transfer of wealth to the middle class). And a continued hokey cokey over academies: are they coming back into local council control or staying out? No one knows.Teachers are battle weary and their appetite for more big reform is low. If the Conservatives were to lift austerity as promised and put a cash boost into schools, while promising to change little else, this could seem appealing. May’s team has also pulled back on free schools and put aside money for mental health programmes. Teachers may not like what they are getting with the Conservatives, but at least they more or less know what it is.The education secretary, Damian Hinds, is leaning into the situation. Last week he attacked Corbyn’s “control freakery” and said giving schools back to councils would mean putting politicians in charge, rather than headteachers. It’s not a fair statement, but in a world where people are fed up with politicians, it’s a canny one.Relying on the Conservatives to make the same mistakes as in the last election would be a fool’s errand. Money will be conjured up just in time for voting grammar schools will be hidden in a weasel-worded policy about “allowing selective schools to expand”.Labour needs to get wise. If there is a general election in the offing it will be hard to go to the polls offering unrealistic sums of cash for an amorphous set of revolutionary-sounding ideas. Teachers are too tired. Parents will find it confusing.The National Education Service needs to be as simple as possible: free childcare, a good quality school place for every child, subsidised university and workplace learning for all. Simple to understand, if horribly complex to deliver. But that’s grown-up politics for you.In the end, teachers and parents of school-aged children are a huge political opportunity. There are 12 million of them. If Labour can win their support, the party has decent prospects in a future election. As it stands, votes are going spare and the Conservatives are on a hunt to catch them.Rayner has the right instincts to fight Hinds, but Corbyn needs to stand back and let her fly. A future election may depend on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd93d553dff961352cd9d7a5321a168929c8b152/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfc4e3fd77fe75fcb38e89171c231142","title":"all sewn up online fashion platform threadcom scoops hm funding","story":"The brand, which combines technology with traditional shopping habits, has revolutionised the omnichannel experienceThread, the menswear fashion e-commerce company that offers a bespoke shopping service to its customers by combining AI with a personalised stylist service, is on track to become a major player on the fashion landscape after securing £16.7m in funding from the H\u0026ampM group.Established six years ago by Kieran O’Neill and Ben Phillips, CEO and CTO respectively, the brand has spent much of its early stages in development, fine-honing its algorithms and perfecting its offering. Customers are asked to subscribe and register their personal details and preferences, which thereafter are used to tailor the fashion items presented to them, aiming to cut down on exhaustive scroll time and target what iniduals are looking for. The tech side of things is complemented by real personal stylists, rather than robots, who are on hand to offer advice and help customers consider options they might not have previously thought of, essentially acting as a membership service with no membership fee.Early approvals boded well. The brand was selected by Y Combinator – the Silicon Valley-based investment company that provides funding and mentoring for innovative new businesses – as one of the 20 most promising start-ups and attracted $10 million seed funding by Balderton Capital in its first round. Now, with this second round of funding, the partners are looking to expand on the omnichannel experience they offer and and take the brand from the start-up sphere and into a household name.So far, Thread has succeeded in securing a comprehensive offering. Among the 536 brands it stocks, there is a healthy mix of luxury (Burberry, Boss and Belstaff), contemporary (Reply, Superdry, All Saints) and high street (New Look, River Island and Marks \u0026amp Spencer) options.O’Neill and Phillips consider themselves being “a good partner” by sharing the anonymised data they capture from their customers with the brands they stock as it helps them understand who their incognito customers are. They have also been invited into the offices of heritage fashion houses, who are eager to know details about how they have bridged the gap between traditional fashion and technology. The founders have kept this service they offer their partners free, and – despite a subscription service seeming like an obvious way to finance the business – plan to keep their model gratis too.Then, says O’Neill, Thread can start “to change how the whole industry and market works”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8e23fdb87c7eb3690a79058df9067838fbcfff/0_0_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e52218a74041c5044cbf268cd11c5f76","title":"a star is reborn what we can learn from actor turned director debuts","story":"As Bradley Cooper and Jonah Hill step behind the camera for A Star is Born and Mid90s, how do their films benefit from their A-list status?A critic will often watch a director’s first film with one eye on what is and one on what might be. For novice feature film-makers, a debut doubles as a diagnostic, an opportunity to show potential as much as present skill. Because first-timers often have to work within constricting parameters – a finite budget, a caliber of actors commensurate with that budget, limited access to the resources of a studio – viewers will give a little leeway in the understanding that they’re watching the film the director was able to make until he or she gets the green light to make the film they truly want to.Such is not the case with a pair of new releases from untested talents in theaters this month. Bradley Cooper and Jonah Hill have both made new forays into feature directing with the latest remake of A Star Is Born and the coming-of-age drama Mid90s, respectively, and their celebrity affords them luxuries unavailable to most film-makers starting out. While shooting, Cooper leveraged his profile and connections to sneak onstage at the Coachella and Glastonbury music festivals, infiltrate the Grammys, and poke around Saturday Night Live’s studio with “guest host” Alec Baldwin. Hill licensed a treasure trove of music that can’t have come cheap, from Herbie Hancock’s funk standard Watermelon Man to the Pixies’ alt-classic Wave of Mutilation to the Smiths cut pre-approved by his pal Morrissey. In either case, the production was the realization of a dream long held by its creator, a true passion project straight out of the gate.It’s a curious phenomenon, when resources and permissions usually reserved for seasoned pros are afforded to artists at the novice level. (Both Hill and Cooper give the Steadicam a workout, but don’t quite know where to take it.) The resultant odd pairing of highly professional polish with developing ability is just one of the qualities of the beginner actor-director, a specific breed of cineaste with a consistent set of virtues of weaknesses. A handful of recent efforts have brought the type into sharper relief, and started to chip away at – though by no means completely overwriting – the image of the preening thespian who utters those dreaded words: “But what I really want to do is direct.”The public presumes a certain measure of vanity when an actor gets behind the camera, a belief proven wrong as frequently as it’s proven right. In some instances, the whiff of ego isn’t quite so faint Ewan McGregor must have been feeling pretty good when he offered to not only dip his toe into film-making with an adaptation of heavy literary hitter Philip Roth, but to assay a neurotic Jewish businessman as a born-and-bred Scotsman. After years of salty-mouthed comedy, Hill is on a crusade to be taken seriously, donning the artiste’s de facto uniform of blocky glasses and all-black ensemble. Many critics scoffed at Cooper’s decision to cast himself as a rock star who romances a girl played by world’s second-biggest pop star because the biggest pop star was busy.It’s not for nothing that the long take, a medium-to-close shot holding on a performer’s face and letting them do their stuff, is the favored implement in any multi-hyphenate’s toolbox. From Hill and Cooper to the more accomplished ranks of Paul Dano (who shows tremendous promise with this year’s Wildlife) and Angelina Jolie, actors place a lot of trust in actors, sometimes to a fault. Not everyone has the chops to hold their own while delivering a monologue without anyone or any edits to hide behind, but the actor-director’s code states that everyone at least deserves a chance to try. Cooper and Hill care about their characters more than any audience could possibly hope to, and the open-hearted empathy can be a wonder all its own.What these films sometimes lack in technical proficiency, they attempt to make up in passion, the result being occasionally amateurish work with a titanic emotional scale and the industry firepower to back it up. Like actors themselves, they want nothing more than to be loved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b9b8456eb07f61254b31a6713f0e0c143056ebd/177_1017_3671_2202/master/3671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdab67e7ae20bda56d40852c8a6d83dd","title":"nigel slater spicy pork with nduja and spinach recipe","story":"Juicy warming meats with spices, cream and green vegYou will need 4 pork steaks, each approximately 125g in weight.

Roll the steak up into a plump sausage and secure with a wooden skewer or a couple of cocktail sticks.Repeat with the remaining steaks and nduja. Put the pork on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, basting occasionally with the bright red, spicy oil that comes from the nduja.Remove the stalks from 400g of spinach leaves.

Put the spinach in a saucepan, add 200ml of double cream, a grating of nutmeg and a seasoning of salt and black pepper. Bring to a bubble, then process briefly in a blender or food processor.Spoon the spinach sauce between 2 plates, then serve the pork steaks on the spinach. Enough for 2.You may need to bat the steaks out a little if they are too thick to stuff and roll. I don’t own a cutlet bat, so make do by wrapping the steaks in clingfilm and beating them firmly with a rolling pin. It is essential to baste the meat with the fat that leaks from the nduja.The nduja is spicy (and the heat can vary from brand to brand) so the creamy spinach is there to balance the heat. You could make a tomato sauce if you prefer, crushing cherry tomatoes and a few rosemary needles with olive oil and cooking for 10 minutes before adding the cream. No nduja?

The depreciation of the Yemeni currency has caused food prices to increase, while the soaring cost of fuel has made transport more expensive.In addition, importers of basics such as cooking oil, rice, sugar and butter have been prevented from entering the country due to restrictions imposed by Yemen’s central bank based in Aden, territory controlled by its exiled government.“Tens of thousands of destitute families, who were barely able to buy what they needed just a few weeks ago, can no longer afford to feed themselves at all,” Grande told the .About 8.5 million people in the Middle East’s poorest country already rely on the World Food Programme to survive, including 1 million who receive cash assistance.But if the current trend continues, as many as 5.6 million more Yemenis may need assistance to survive.Grande said: “Things are deteriorating very, very quickly. The implications of this are enormous, and, truthfully, frightening. The reality is that time may be running out.”The UN’s humanitarian lead, who met with key donors on Monday, said the agency was now scrambling to raise funds for emergency cash assistance.Grande said: “One of the fastest and most effective ways of helping destitute families is to give them cash. This allows them to buy what they need, when they need it. Humanitarians are looking at ways to expand cash programmes as quickly as possible.”Her comments came as a representative from the Norwegian Refugee Council criticised Britain for supplying arms to Saudi Arabia.Suze van Meegen, a protection and advocacy adviser for the council based in Sana’a, said: “I anticipate the calls will come for international government to inject more cash into solving the crisis.“But the crisis doesn’t lie with money. It lies in stopping the war. There is a duplicity in the UK, for example, where the British government is providing a lot of money to help us reach people with aid but it could get more bang for its buck if it just stopped selling weapons to Saudi Arabia.”Van Meegen said people are already starving to death in “very large numbers”.“From our perspective we may as well consider ourselves already in famine. This time last year we warned that 8.4 million people were already on the brink of famine. The images now speak for themselves.”She added: “There is direct violence but equally we are seeing slow systematic steps by both sides to undermine the economy. It means food is more expensive, it’s double the price it was even a few weeks ago.”Since the offensive on Hodeidah began in June, the Norwegian Refugee Council has seen the nature of its work change. Where previously it was trying to help Yemenis through assistance with education and livelihoods, the focus has shifted to survival.Van Meegen said: “Our focus is helping those people who have left home with nothing but a few items in a plastic bag with food and cash. The other thing we are doing is trucking water which is hard to come by and very expensive.”Announcing Tuesday’s aid package the minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said the money would help screen 2.2 million children under the age of five and provide urgent treatment for 70,000 of the most vulnerable youngsters.“The UK is extremely concerned at the deepening humanitarian crisis … Children are suffering the most and are 12 times more likely to die from diseases. Today’s aid package will help identify cases of malnourishment earlier and provide life-saving care for those most in need,” he said.He called on all parties to support the UN special envoy’s peace talks to find a political solution to end the conflict.The Department for International Development said the aid package of £96.5m will fund the UN children’s agency, Unicef, to tackle malnutrition over three years. Some of the funding is from a £170m package announced for Yemen on 3 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a3490035318cff53ca1f49745c3da8f9b8133c/0_113_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46859099051f30e4b44ee7b9d04dd988","title":"ecuador embassy tells assange clean bathroom feed the cat do laundry","story":"WikiLeaks founder told by Ecuadorian embassy to respect rules or lose diplomatic asylum Ecuador has laid out a stringent new set of house rules for Julian Assange, warning the whistleblower to avoid online comments about political issues – and ordering him to clean his bathroom and take better care of his cat, or risk losing his pet.Assange, who has been living in Ecuador’s UK embassy since June 2012, must obtain approval for all visitors from diplomatic staff three days in advance. He is expressly banned from activities which could be “considered as political or interfering with the internal affairs of other states,” according to the memo seen by the .Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since June 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.The Ecuadorian government partially lifted restrictions Assange’s internet access at the weekend, but the document stipulates that the WikiLeaks founder will only be allowed to use the embassy wifi for his personal computer and phone.The Australian and his guests are explicitly prohibited from using or installing “unauthorised equipment”.According to the memo, the embassy “reserved the right to authorise security personnel to seize equipment” or ask the British authorities to enter the embassy and do so. Any attempt to bring such equipment into the embassy would be reported as a “security breach and reported to the competent British authorities.”Ecuador’s government suspended Assange’s internet access in March, saying that he had breached “a written commitment made to the government at the end of 2017 not to issue messages that might interfere with other states”.However, Assange had previously operated freely within the embassy – even compromising its communications system, the  detailed in a series of reports in May.Assange was told to take charge of the “well-being, food, hygiene and proper care” of his pet cat, in the memo written in Spanish and first published on the Ecuadorian Código Vidrio website.It warned that if the WikiLeaks founder did not take care of the pet, it would be given to someone else or handed in to an animal refuge.“It’s virtually a prison regime,” Carlos Poveda, Assange’s lawyer in Quito told the . “This new regime goes against his basic human dignity as an asylee,” he said. Poveda added that as of Monday Assange had not had his internet restored and had not been able to read and understand the memo as it had not been translated from Spanish.The memo implored Assange and his guests to keep the bathroom clean and stated the diplomatic mission would not pay towards his food, laundry or any other costs related to his stay from 1 December 2018 onwards. Assange must also have quarterly medical check-ups that he must pay for too, it stated.Any failure to comply with the news house rules “could lead to the termination of the diplomatic asylum granted by the Ecuadorian state,” it added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53cefc7a484ae88da42af98551ad4d78f59b8a5/0_49_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=531f104cc5b1b66ab8e017e4761a5cf4","title":"eu scraps plans for brexit summit statement on future trade deal","story":"‘No-deal’ meeting set for November may also be off after ‘decisive progress’ on Irish backstop fails to materialiseEU leaders have scrapped plans to make public a draft declaration on the bloc’s future trade deal with the UK and are set to rule out a November Brexit summit after Michel Barnier said the necessary “decisive progress” in the negotiations had failed to materialise.An outline of an agreement was due to be “on the table” at a summit dinner of leaders on Wednesday night, before which the prime minister is scheduled to address the 27 other EU heads of state.An extraordinary meeting of leaders to finalise the outline of the future relationship, a step long-sought by Downing Street, had also been pencilled in for the weekend of 17 and 18 November.Developments on Sunday, when the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, refused to sign off on an agreement on the Irish border, have brought the carefully choreographed plans to a halt.Arriving in Luxembourg, where he will brief EU ministers on the state of the negotiations, Barnier said his benchmark for success had not been reached. “We are not there yet. There are several subjects that remain open, including Ireland,” he said. “As I understand we need more time to find this comprehensive agreement and achieve decisive progress.”Barnier said the EU was going to work “calmly and seriously” to finalise an agreement.Germany’s EU minister, Michael Roth, said Berlin was aware the prime minister was constrained by her domestic vulnerability. Asked what his message to May would be, he told reporters: “Take responsibility and be constructive.”“We can have either a smooth Brexit or rocky one,” said France’s EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau. “We all prefer a smooth one but we have to stand ready if there is no deal.”During a summit in Salzburg last month, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, had demanded “maximum progress” in the talks to allow the negotiations to develop.The backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland remains a key sticking point, with the EU proposing that Northern Ireland in effect stay in the customs union and single market.Tusk, on the bidding of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had said such progress being made in the talks was a condition for an extraordinary meeting on Brexit to be held in November.It now appears that a crunch summit in December could be in play. But senior UK officials have suggested that such a timetable could make it all but impossible to get the necessary Brexit legislation through parliament in time for 29 March 2019.Discussions in Brussels had been held in recent days over holding a “no-deal” summit in November, and this option will be discussed by leaders.A French government official suggested that an alternative plan would be to bring a November summit forward should there be movement by the UK on the Irish issue in the coming weeks, with December then taking on the ceremonial role of signing off on a political declaration.With such uncertainty in the process, the European commission is expected this week to publish a new raft of “no deal” notices to alert businesses and member states on how to deal with the UK crashing out of the bloc. They had been held back for fear of upsetting the talks, at a point when progress had been detected.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, is to update leaders on the bloc’s state of readiness at the summit dinner, with an EU source saying “the time is ripe” for such a move.“These are real issues,” the official said. “Maybe they are not as dramatic as in the UK but they are still real and they will still affect life on the continent.”The EU official, speaking on the eve of what had been billed as a “moment of truth” summit for the Brexit talks, said: “Clearly we are not in the place we wanted to be in October, so from that perspective that truth is … we have clarity actually. More clarity now than in September in Salzburg. What we have found out in the process leading to this meeting on Wednesday is that it is not going to be so easy to find a deal between the EU and the UK.”Asked whether Tusk and the EU leaders would be careful to avoid repeating the outcome of the Salzburg summit, which was widely said to have been a humiliation for May, the EU official responded: “Sometimes you have the impression that telling the truth is showing a lack of respect but we believe that it is on the contrary.”He added: “The economic part of Chequers is not going to work, there is no way to frictionless trade outside the single market and customs union.”May is to address the EU27 leaders in a room on the third floor of the Europa building in Brussels, before the heads of state have a dinner without her to discuss their next steps.“There will not be any food on the table,” the EU official joked of the first meeting, adding that he did not expect May’s intervention to play a major role in the discussions. He said attempts to ide the 27 other member states have only strengthened the unity of the EU and their backing for both Barnier and the Republic of Ireland in the talks.On Monday, May had said she would not accept the EU’s proposal on the backstop, in which Northern Ireland could potentially stay in the customs union and single market as the rest of the UK withdrew.“You remember that line that there is no withdrawal agreement without a backstop that will work, which is legally binding, so I think that is not going to change. But we still hope that there is a way to find an agreement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb99f0212fc618cbde8c8c64af9f57bae1b001c1/0_94_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffc1acee27cc3551fbdb95c60703b652","title":"irish ambassador accuses theresa may of backsliding on border backstop","story":"Adrian O’Neill says post-Brexit arrangement for open border is ‘crucial safety net’ to Good Friday agreementIreland has expressed concern that the British government is “backsliding” on Theresa May’s firm commitment to sign up to a backstop promise for the Irish border that would guarantee the open border remains after Brexit in the event of no deal.In an unusually outspoken speech, Adrian O’Neill, the Irish ambassador to the UK, told an audience of British civil servants and EU embassy officials he was alarmed that some Brexiter MPs think the backstop was not even necessary.That there was still no deal on the Irish border, nine months after the prime minister had signed up to the backstop option, was “both disappointing and concerning”, O’Neill said.He said that it was unlikely there could be a deal in the next 48 hours, and the “most benign” outcome of the European council was that the prime minister would make a speech that bettered the EU27’s understanding of her position “and that would lead to renewed impetus in negotiations”.“Time is not on our side, and with each passing day we grow increasingly concerned that decisive progress on Northern Ireland has not made,” he said.“It is even more concerning that we hear comments in some quarters here that the backstop is unnecessary,” O’Neill added. A no-deal hard border he said, had the capacity to “disturb the delicate and complex balance of the Good Friday agreement and disrupt the fragile peace”.The backstop, he said, was a “crucial safety net” for the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland.“We should be in no doubt that the prospect of Brexit, especially a hard Brexit, or a no-deal Brexit, is causing genuine anxiety in Northern Ireland,” said O’Neill.He pointed out that Theresa May had committed to a backstop back in December with no mention of a time limit to it, an idea that the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has said is a “deal-breaker”.Sources within the EU express frustration that the time-limit idea had already been dismissed after it was put forward in June as part of Theresa May’s pre-Chequers customs proposals.The time limit was inserted under pressure from hard Brexiters who threatened to resign if there was an open-ended backstop, but back-channel communications from Downing Street to EU officials suggested this was not something May was committed to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ee88a9bf48abd1a6e47df302e13157abd9ef09/0_218_1166_700/master/1166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e85584a40b95e5d4924e03f6007cb62c","title":"theresa may calls for unity after winning cabinet backing for brexit strategy","story":"Prime minister asks cabinet to ‘stand together and stand firm’ day before crucial EU summitTheresa May has won the backing of the cabinet for her Brexit negotiating strategy after a two-and-half-hour discussion that centred on concerns about when the UK could leave any customs backstop it signed up to as part of the EU orce deal.The prime minister called for political unity after the lengthy meeting, during which all cabinet members spoke, telling them a day before a crucial European summit that “if we as a government stand together and stand firm we can achieve this”.Her official spokesman said cabinet members had agreed that the UK “cannot be kept in the backstop indefinitely” and that ministers had discussed “the need for a mechanism to clearly define how that backstop will end”.But the spokesman would not be drawn on what mechanism was being considered and whether inidual cabinet members had pressed her to insist upon having a specific date by which any backstop agreement would terminate.Cabinet members had been urged to rebel against the prime minister’s strategy by former Brexit secretary David Davis over the weekend, but there was no immediate sign that May was put under any serious pressure at the meeting.No 10 said nobody at the meeting had threatened to resign, leaving May free to ask EU leaders on Wednesday night for their help in kickstarting the stalled negotiations.May is now address EU leaders before they retire to discuss Brexit without her over dinner in Brussels, and is hoping that they unblock the impasse by agreeing to negotiate further on the backstop in the run-up to an emergency summit in November.Cabinet members including Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house, have privately said the UK should insist on a firm date for ending the backstop. Some fear it could be used to keep the country in a form of customs union indefinitely.Similar concerns were voiced by Conservative Brexiters in the Commons on Monday, when May updated MPs on the status of the Brexit negotiations, with the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith asking the prime minister: “How long does she think this temporary arrangement might last and, most importantly, who would make the final decision on when it ends?”No 10 said cabinet members also endorsed May’s call to “maintain the integrity of the union” between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which the prime minister had told the Tuesday morning meeting was under threat by the EU’s proposed version of the backstop.The spokesman said May had told her political colleagues it was “not possible for her or any UK prime minister to sign up to an arrangement that would lead to a custom border down the Irish Sea”.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal.As a result, the EU is continuing to insist on having its own backstop, which would mean that Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and the customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Tory hard Brexiters and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up her government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae449337eb0dbba5f008baa427f9fa4df0056c7d/64_32_3448_2068/master/3448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7a353023d93f87ba3c2cf0b68a5804","title":"brexit theresa may chairs cabinet as eu says no deal more likely than ever before politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThe BBC’s Gavin Lee has posted on Twitter another quote from Donald Tusk.Turning back to Brexit, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has been speaking to journalists in Brussels. He has issued a challenge to Theresa May. He said:Unfortunately the report on the state of the negotiations that I got from Michel Barnier today, as well as yesterday’s debate in the House of Commons, gives me no grounds for optimism before tomorrow’s European council on Brexit.As I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides. However, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts. Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough is possible. While working on a Brexit deal, we also need to make sure that we are prepared in case an agreement is not possible or in case it is rejected. Therefore tomorrow the leaders will discuss how to step up our preparations for a no deal scenario.But, as I have already stressed, the fact that we are preparing for a no deal scenario must not under any circumstances lead us away from making every effort to reach the best agreement possible for all sides.And here are the key news lines.Sir Edward Leigh, a Conserative, says the speaker should be protected from political pressure. Can Leadsom guarantee that the executive will not try to pressurise the speaker at the House of Commons commission meeting on Monday.Leadsom says the commission will consider the Cox reports.Labour’s Ben Bradshaw says some of the contributions from Tory MPs are motivated by hostility towards John Bercow. He cannot speak back. At the time of Brexit, we need a speaker who will stand up for the House, he says.Leadsom says the Commons should not have to rely on a single inidual to do a good job as speaker.Andrew Murrison, a Conservative, says this must not become a witch hunt. Action must be taken, but appropriate action. MPs could be educated in how to behave, and how to manage their anger, he says.Leadsom says the review that led to the new grievance procedure did propose offering training to offending MPs as part of the solution.The Labour MP Jess Phillips says she is not here to defend anyone, “including you Mr Speaker”. She says she has spoken to many of the victims. She suggests that James Duddridge (see 2.18pm) has not. She says he’s “neither right nor honourable”.She says she thinks there are 12 MPs walking around who bully staff who will be allowed to continue.John Bercow intervenes. He says all MPs are honourable.Leadsom says, if Phillips knows of 12 bullying MP, she should report them.Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, asks Leadsom to explicitly back calls for historic allegations against MPs to be investigated.Leadsom says the Cox report recommendations will be fully taken into account when the new grievance procedures are reviewed.Sir Paul Beresford, the Conservative MP, asks if it would be appropriate for the parliamentary commissioner for standards to consider the allegations against some MPs that triggered the Cox report. And would it be sensible for the standards committee to review the rule saying investigations can only go back seven years.Leadsom says those are good suggestions and the House of Commons commission should consider them on Monday.Earlier this year the Commons standards committee, that oversees investigations by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, said that the allegations against Bercow should not be investigated because of the seven-year time limit.HuffPost’s Paul Waugh has more on John Bercow’s mimicking skills.Labour’s Sir Kevin Barron says there should be no limits on how far back in the past investigations can go.Leadsom says when the working group looked at this, it considered this issue. But the group also took the view that it would be difficult to judge MPs for things that happened in the past against rules drawn up now. She says they took external advice that backed this up. And, the further back you went, the more problematic that became.Andrew Bridgen, another Conservative, asks how those how are part of the problem can be considered to be part of the solution.Leadsom says the House of Commons commission will consider this when it meets on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c49d054419c7139c5a287929403c4c5c54af40/0_32_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c86b84460a676b12ed9e249bf7473ab","title":"earth science in our lives photography competition winners 2018","story":"The Geological Society of London has announced the results of its 2018 Earth Science Week photography competition.

Geoff Lemon and I have frequently taken an unorthodox approach to staying afloat as freelancers, but buying the means of production on my credit cards, without a sponsor in sight, appeared a new and preposterous one.Fast forward a couple of weeks, to the penultimate delivery of the 90th over of the final day at Dubai. Sure, throughout the gripping struggle our vantage point was air-conditioned and comfortable as opposed to the sweat-soaked and heatstroked condition of players on the field. But having called half the Test each and stayed on air through almost every interval, we had logged some 21 hours apiece behind the mic by the time Tim Paine’s stoic defence stuck the landing on his fledgling side’s 140-over Mission Impossible. We didn’t feel the exhaustion at that point, just the elation and adrenaline at describing a classic moment in Test cricket’s grand narrative, and the energy of having listeners from all over the world surge to our coverage to hear the grandstand conclusion. Still, as soon as the mics went off, we realised our condition was what the Australian parlance would describe as “completely rooted”.Perhaps not quite as rooted as six months earlier, when the Australian men’s Test team comprehensively destroyed their international reputation in South Africa, and we didn’t sleep for a week in trying to service every media outlet around the world that wanted round-the-clock updates on the story. But that wasn’t the moment that we reflected on at stumps in Dubai. Instead, we looked back four years, during the corresponding Australian tour of the UAE under Michael Clarke’s reign.Disclaimer time: there is no way to honour the ’s kind request and tell this tale without now moving into a backstory that could be read as self-indulgent. Please be kind below the line.In 2014 it was Geoff’s second year running pro-am internet radio commentary out of his living room. He wasn’t the first to chance his hand at calling the cricket off the telly – Daniel Norcross and company of Test Match Sofa had that honour – but he was the first in Australia and had a more pressing reason given there was often no radio coverage at all of our nation’s overseas tours. I had been pondering a similar idea, so Geoff found me off the internet and gave me a start for his project. We had a ball (-by-ball), commentating from the obscene vinyl and velour couch inside a ramshackle house that was owned by Freemasons who had been threatening to demolish it for a decade. Soon the initial venture was streamlined and White Line Wireless was born.A few months on, Geoff incinerated the Nine Network’s cricket coverage and the disintegration of some elements of its quality, in what remains his most-read piece and perhaps his most impactful. Nine’s director of cricket, Brad McNamara, came in for particular attention and didn’t take the criticism well. But what he didn’t grasp was that Geoff’s comments came from a place of love: a belief that cricket commentary should have intelligence and warmth and should welcome everyone the same way and a desire to see it weave its magic on new arrivals to the game in the way that it captured us when we were kids.What we shared was an unstinting love for radio cricket commentary and a belief that it was special and necessary. We became quasi-business partners on the cricket circuit full-time, incessantly enough that Geoff began using the phrase “platonic life partners”. For his part, his former life as a poet meant that he was born for the soliloquies and metaphors that cricket writing demands. For mine, a decade beating the hell out of myself in professional politics suggested that I had the endurance. Various chances brought us together calling cricket on the radio here and there, but neither of us were naive enough to imagine ending up on any full-time rosters.At the beginning, Geoff’s rationale for pirate radio was that nobody else was broadcasting the Tests from overseas, so he would do it himself. Aside from the fact that only people with financial means could buy pay coverage of those games, one particular point of note was that people with vision impairments couldn’t follow television coverage. When cricket fans in that position wrote to thank us for being their lifeline it had a huge impact. For this tour in 2018, the situation and rationale was much the same. No formal outlet was doing it, aside from our dear friends at White Line Wireless. But now, we had a much better command of how to do it with the official tag. Given the support of Wisden Cricket Monthly through their online platform, the deal was struck with the Pakistan board and with it Wisden Test Cricket.We didn’t know how to pay for it, of course, but nothing sharpens the mind like the prospect of losing a serious sum of money – especially when learning that my initial projections were well short of the pin. As for technology and the broader logistical maze that needed navigating, if our friend from home Andrew Donnison hadn’t made the trip to produce the show, we simply couldn’t have made it to air.After Paine defended that final delivery, he and Nathan Lyon shared a hug. So did we in the commentary box, with the energy of the audience who had proven our point to begin: that cricket on the radio is special. The cliche about it being the soundtrack of summer exists because, for so many millions of Australians, it’s true. The number of people who wrote to thank us for the coverage while they were washing the dishes, walking the dog, driving home late at night, or rocking the kids to sleep only affirmed what we knew to be true.So no, we won’t leave the Emirates with bulging pockets. And because we have now given this a bash and made it happen, there will be people cleverer and better resourced who might do the same next time around. Perhaps they’ll blow us out of the water. Perhaps we’ll find the means to do it again. But at least we had a crack when the chance and the need arose.

Gatland said: “This autumn is the start of a 12-month countdown to the Rugby World Cup and it is a huge opportunity for the players.“The players who performed and represented Wales so well in the summer deserve the opportunity again, and we are really pleased with the depth we have built across the squad.“We have added in a lot of experience with eight British and Irish Lions coming into the squad, so there is a lot of competition for places.“Some experienced players have missed out. The message to them is ‘the door isn’t closed looking long-term’, it’s just a reflection of where we are depth-wise and the opportunity to look at other players.“A further eight players haven’t been selected due to injury. Dependent on their recovery, they could be called in at a later date.“The two uncapped players in Luke and Jonah are both form, back-three players, and we are looking forward to seeing them in this environment and seeing what they can do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2021feeb7d891930a45ab3c700ddde26223a321/1_0_4353_2613/master/4353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf98aa9706509d4b572a70b43916c900","title":"huawei mate 20 pro launches in screen fingerprint sensor","story":"Feature-packed Android phone is first widely available with scanner embedded in screen alongside 3D face unlockingHuawei’s new Mate 20 Pro has a massive screen, three cameras on the back and a fingerprint scanner embedded in the display.The new top-end phone from the Chinese firm aims to secure its place at the top of the market alongside Samsung, having recently beaten Apple to become the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in August.The Mate 20 Pro follows Huawei’s tried and trusted format for its Mate series: a huge 6.39in QHD+ OLED screen, big 4,200mAh battery and powerful new Huawei Kirin 980 processor – Huawei’s first to be produced at 7 nanometres, matching Apple’s latest A12 chip in the 2018 iPhones.New for this year is an infrared 3D facial recognition system, similar to that used by Apple for its Face ID in the iPhone XS, and one of the first fingerprint scanners embedded in the screen that is widely available in the UK, removing the need for a fingerprint scanner on the back or a notch on the front.The Mate 20 Pro is water resistant to IP68 standards and has a sleek new design reminiscent of Samsung’s S-series phones, with curved glass on the front and back. The back also has an new pattern etched into the glass, which is smooth to the touch but ridged when running your nail over it.“The hyper-optical pattern reduces smudging, is a little grippier than normal smooth glass so it’s less slippery in the hand, and it looks great,” said Peter Gauden, global senior product marketing manager for Huawei.On the back is a new version of Huawei’s award-winning triple camera system using a 40-megapixel standard camera, an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom and new for this year is a 20-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, replacing the monochrome sensor used on the P20 Pro.“The monochrome lens from last year was barely used, so we switched it out for the wide-angle camera,” Gauden said. “Now you can take really epic wide-angle shots, with the camera automatically zooming in or out on the fly, recognising when you’re trying to take a photo of a cat or dog, or something that would aesthetically benefit from a wider shot, or you can manually press the zoom button to switch.”The Mate 20 Pro will also be the first Huawei phone with the company’s latest EMUI 9, based on Android 9 Pie, which it said has been optimised to significantly speed up regular tasks.Alongside the Mate 20 Pro, Huawei also launched a cheaper Mate 20 without the face recognition or embedded fingerprint scanner, and a new fitness-focused smartwatch using its own-brand LiteOS called the Huawei Watch GT.“These new devices will be of great concern to rival smartphone makers,” said Ben Wood, chief of research for CCS Insight. “The Huawei P20 devices (P20 Pro, P20 and P20 Lite) have already grabbed substantial share in key markets such as Europe and AsiaPacific and have only been prevented from securing share in the US because of the ban on Huawei products that occurred in January 2018.”“We believe camera capabilities will emerge as the star feature on these new devices, in particular the Mate 20 Pro. If it can replicate the performance of the P20 Pro it will further underline Huawei’s growing status as smartphone camera maker,” Wood said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c178ad70b269c9ade5bc4098a886477a0d410e0/0_91_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37a486fb3d6fd69f87adbbd7da7d0485","title":"whisper it the good place might need divine intervention","story":"Season one of The Good Place was fantastic, season two was awe-inspiring. How could season three top it? Short answer: it hasn’t When The Good Place fires on all cylinders, it’s like watching a magic trick. It manages to be bracingly intelligent, painfully funny and perpetually restless all at the same time. It functions as a sitcom with a good-to-great gag hit rate, a Lost-style mystery-box story that is always one step ahead of its viewers and a thorough yet accessible lecture about the importance of ethics.Season one of The Good Place was fantastic. Season two of The Good Place was nothing short of awe-inspiring. How on earth could season three top it? Short answer: it hasn’t. Whisper it – just like plenty of other people are whispering it on Twitter – but The Good Place may have gone off the boil.We’re four episodes in to the new season, but, even if you put a gun to my head, I wouldn’t be able to tell you anything meaningful that has happened. Team Cockroach are back in the real world, inertly bimbling around in Sydney, surrounded by not a single person with a convincing Australian accent. Michael and Janet are sort of exiled on Earth with them, but also not because they have a key that lets them in and out of the afterlife as they please. Anyway, it doesn’t matter because, on either plane, they’re essentially limited to watching the action on a screen. The storytelling feels stuck. Worse, it’s starting to feel like a traditional sitcom.Contrast these four episodes with the four that opened season two, one of the giddiest bursts of pure storytelling I can remember. Those episodes told the story of the devil caught in a lie, backpedalling and outsmarted by the humans he is supposed to torture, until he relents and agrees to learn basic ethics. Those episodes – Dance Dance Resolution in particular – tore through enough story to feed several years of a lesser show. They were a demonstration of strength that seem to be absent this year.Until now, The Good Place has operated from a place of propulsion not just in terms of narrative, but with character growth. Nothing stays still for long on The Good Place, which is why this new run – with everyone stuck in the same place, repeating the same beats – feels frustrating. One possible explanation for this is that, on Earth, Janet lacks her infinite powers. In the afterlife she was a terrific device, conjuring up anything at all in an instant to keep things moving along. On Earth she is just a regular person, and when she is needed to pull some magic out of the bag – such as in the scene last week where she picked a winning Lotto scratchcard on the basis that she memorised its placement before she visited Australia – it feels like too much of a stretch. You can hear the gears working in ways you previously couldn’t.So The Good Place is, for the time being, no longer great. The question is whether it will ever be great again. Here’s where I’m undecided. Michael Schur is undoubtedly one of the finest minds to ever work in comedy. But we have seen his shows take a nosee before. There was a time when Parks and Recreation was the best programme on TV. Seasons two, three and four were as funny, silly and warm as anyone could have hoped. It took a wobble in season five before the final two years fell off a cliff. They were almost unrecognisably bad cartoonish in a way they had never been and treacly in a way it had always avoided. Those last two years of Parks and Rec make me wonder if The Good Place has already peaked.If it has, then so be it. I loved the first two seasons with the intensity of an exploding planet, and I’ll always have those even if the rest of the show slides into irrelevance. However, I still have hope. The end of the last episode saw Team Cockroach stumble across the portal to the afterlife, which might just cure everything. It could open the story up, give everyone the purpose they have lacked and offer much more potential for jokes. In theory, it will roar loudly enough to make The Good Place the best thing on TV again. The best-case scenario is that I’ll read this article back next week and wonder what the hell I was thinking. I desperately, desperately want this to happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9875a7d3f5f0ef2e064be9828627da2e698f2a9/0_71_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a177dd90acaddba561661703e8b7047c","title":"witches public hexing brett kavanaugh","story":"The planned ceremony has angered Fox News and rightwing commentators, which is exactly the point says the organiserA coven of witches will gather in an occult bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, on Saturday to place a hex on the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh. Tickets to the event, which cost $10, with half the proceeds going to women’s and LGBT charities, have already sold out.The event is not out of the ordinary for Catland Books, which describes itself as “Brooklyn’s premier metaphysical boutique and event space”. They have previously held ceremonies to hex Donald Trump as well as a “hex your ex” ceremony on Valentine’s Day.Dakota Bracciale, co-owner of the store, told the  the event will be an important act of protest and community outreach, even if some attendees are skeptical.“The whole thing is going to be really cathartic, whether you believe it or not. The right has churches but the left is scattershot. The left is where you’re going to find atheists, secularists, humanists, people who follow non-traditional religions. So how are you going to get all of us together in times of trouble? That’s what we’ve been doing.”Amy Kremer, the co-founder of the Women Vote Trump Pac, brought the event up in a roundtable on MSNBC, describing it as an escalation of attempts to publicly shame Republicans. “It is a scary time right now. Sarah Sanders has been run out of restaurants. I mean, there’s a list of things going on. Now you’ve got witches that are placing a hex on Brett Kavanaugh.”The event’s Facebook page has also been flooded with comments opposing the event, many of them proclaiming it an affront to Christianity. “Kavanaugh is a Christian. True Christians have the protection of our heavenly father against others that desire a demon attack against them,” wrote one commenter.Bracciale says that the store also organises more traditional protests and voter registration drives, but using the language of occult has been more effective in riling up their opponents. “It strikes fear into the heart of Christian fundamentalists. That’s one of the reasons that we do it. Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. We don’t subscribe to this bullshit, pacifist, love and light, everybody just get along thing. If you want to hijack the country, if you want to steal the election, if you want to overturn Roe v Wade, if you want to harm people who are queer, well guess what, we’re not doing civility. If you’re going to be these awful bullies, you have to understand someone is going to punch you back and it might as well be a bunch of witches from Brooklyn.”The actual event will involve two rituals. The first will be putting a hex on Kavanaugh. Everyone in the room will focus on an image of the judge while passages are recited and candles burned. Graveyard dirt, coffin nails and effigies will also feature.The second is the rite of the scorned one, created by Bracciale, which is about welcoming rage. “It’s saying that constant, absolute pacifism only leads to you getting harmed more. Sometimes there has to be an allowance for rage as your ally.”Some have been critical of those declaring themselves witches, claiming that the subculture is based more on consumerism than spiritualism. But Bracciale differentiates what happens in the bookstore from more basic witches.“I don’t recognise the supposed witchcraft of $80-Lulu-Lemon-Yoga-pant-wearing white women with chai lattes who rub crystals on themselves, read The Secret and send out good thoughts into the universe. To me that’s not witchcraft. Witchcraft has a deeply rooted history as a tool of resistance and resilience, to survive oppression, disenfranchisement, and being an outcast of society.”Despite the news network’s negative coverage of the event, Bracciale has agreed to appear on Fox News over the weekend to discuss the event. “I grew up in a house where Fox was blaring 247, full volume, I know how they try to derail and distract. If you don’t rise to it then they fall flat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caef0dabf4774a0545e6a4c58f1d2998953eb7da/84_70_1744_1046/master/1744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4eff1e7b5c6dac4033ff378f4aae257","title":"jamal khashoggi disappearance mike pompeo saudi arabia salman","story":"Mike Pompeo meets King Salman amid reports Riyadh may admit journalist was killed in Istanbul consulateThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has arrived in Saudi Arabia for crisis talks with King Salman, as reports emerged that the kingdom was poised to acknowledge that the missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi died inside a diplomatic building in Istanbul.Pompeo landed in Riyadh on Tuesday morning and met the king immediately to discuss the crisis surrounding Khashoggi, who vanished two weeks ago during a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The US’s top diplomat “reiterated US concern over Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance”, according to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.He later met the county’s powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and is on Wednesday due to visit Istanbul, where a joint Turkish-Saudi investigation is under way.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Tuesday said police who entered the consulate for the first time on Monday had found some surfaces had been painted over. “My hope is that we can reach conclusions that will give us a reasonable opinion as soon as possible, because the investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over,” he told reporters.Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, relocated from Saudi Arabia to the US last year, where he wrote for the Washington Post. He visited the Saudi consulate building in Istanbul on 2 October for an appointment to pick up documents for his forthcoming marriage and has not been seen since.Turkish officials allege they have video and audio evidence that proves Khashoggi was interrogated and murdered by a 15-man hit squad sent from Riyadh – claims Saudi Arabia continues to deny, although it has offered no alternative version of events.US media outlets reported late on Monday that Saudi Arabia was considering making a statement admitting that Khashoggi died inside the consulate building as the result of a botched rendition.Any such admission would be issued only after a deal was reached with Turkey on how the criminal investigation should proceed, the Washington Post reported, citing two US diplomatic sources.Last week, the US president threatened “severe punishment” if it emerged that Khashoggi had been murdered. However, on Monday he said, without offering evidence, that Khashoggi could have been murdered by “rogue killers”, prompting speculation that the White House may be willing to protect the House of Saud, a key political and trade ally, from blame for the diplomatic crisis.Turkish investigators were allowed access to the diplomatic building for the first time on Monday afternoon. Technicians in overalls, gloves and covered shoes emerged nine hours later.Ankara has wanted to search the consulate for days, but under the Vienna convention, diplomatic posts are technically foreign soil that must be protected and respected by host countries.Before the Turkish team arrived, cleaners with disinfectant, mops and buckets were seen entering the building’s main door.Although it was not immediately clear what evidence could be extracted two weeks after Khashoggi’s disappearance, al-Jazeera reported that a source in the Turkish attorney general’s office said the search team found sufficient evidence to “support the belief” the missing writer was killed.Police plan to conduct a second search, of the Saudi consul’s home in Istanbul, on Tuesday. Khashoggi wrote extensively for the Washington Post about Saudi Arabia, criticising its war in Yemen, the recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women’s rights activists after the lifting of a driving ban for women. Those policies are all seen as initiatives of Bin Salman, who is next in line to the throne.Khashoggi’s family, who said they have been left to “sadly and anxiously follow the conflicting news”, on Monday called for an independent investigation into his disappearance.“The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death,” the statement read.The call was echoed on Tuesday by the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, who urged Ankara and Riyadh to waive diplomatic immunity in the case and “reveal everything they know about the disappearance and possible extrajudicial killing” of Khashoggi."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days offer prospective students a unique opportunity to sample life on campusWhat you need to know to make sure you take full advantage of your open day opportunityOpen days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will be"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665474.1539699816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"judge recommends tribunal to deal with cervicalcheck claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file image of Vicky Phelan at Government Buildings following a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A tribunal should be established to hear and determine claims arising out of the CervicalCheck controversy, according to a report published on Tuesday. Mr Justice Charles Meenan was asked by Minister for Health Simon Harris to see if there was an alternative to the courts system for dealing with claims arising out of CervicalCheck. His report was discussed by the Cabinet today and published at lunchtime. Mr Justice Meenan said were such a tribunal set up hearings would be in private and it would be less formal than a court process. Participation would be voluntary.A right of appeal to the High Court would remain and a fast-track mechanism would apply where liability was not being contested.The report does not set out the costs of operating the proposed tribunal but Mr Justice Meenan says damages arising from a negligent misreading of a cervical smear would be “potentially very significant”.The women at the centre of the controversy cautiously welcomed the report but expressed disappointment that a commitment by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to a “totally non-adversarial process” has not been realised.The 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support Group called for a time limit to be set on the work of the tribunal so that women, many of whom are ill, can have their issues resolved quickly.Mr Harris commissioned the report in response to controversy over the screening programme sparked by Limerick woman Vicky Phelan, who has cervical cancer, settling a High Court action in April over the reading of her smear test.It later emerged that more than 200 women were not informed of an audit which revised their early, negative smear tests. Many are taking legal cases against the testing labs and the HSE.Mr Justice Meenan said there were two issues involved: allegations that the smear tests had been negligently read and a failure to disclose to the women the results of audits carried out on the smear tests, after their cancer was diagnosed.There were serious issues on liability on the reading of the smears, he said. A significant number of smears will be reported as showing no abnormalities “despite there being possible abnormalities present.“This does not, of itself, amount to negligence on the part of the person(s) reading the smear,” he pointed out. “Missed does not mean negligence.”Issues of liability on non-disclosure of audit results “may legally be of a less contentious nature,” the report states.Given the issues on liability, a redress scheme based on no-fault liability was not appropriate, according to Mr Justice Meenan.The cases attracted considerable publicity, and a serious concern that hearing evidence of a “particularly intimate nature” in public in the High Court was wrong, he noted.The tragic deaths from cervical cancer of a number of the women involved in the controversy also underlined the need to avoid delay in acting upon the proposals in the report, he said.Mr Justice Meenan said he believed the tribunal model he is proposing has application to other medical negligence claims.Legislation would be required to set up the tribunal, which would be chaired by a serving or retired judge of the higher courts. Parties would be entitled to legal representation and would be limited to calling one expert witness only.In a statement the Department of Health said this “alternative system will take into account the issue of liability, each person’s Constitutional right of access to the courts and all parties’ Constitutional rights to fair procedures. “ In his report Mr Justice Meenan recognises the courage and fortitude of the women and their families who told him of their experiences of dealing with the devastating consequences of cervical cancer and the effects of the non-disclosure, or disclosure in an unacceptable way, of the results of audits carried out following diagnosis. Minister Harris said: “I would like to thank Mr Justice Meenan for his invaluable report. He has carried out an extensive piece of work, including consultation with the women, their families and their representatives.” “Mr Justice Meenan’s report requires consideration by a number of Government Departments and I have committed this morning to returning to Government with proposals next month.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Women affected by controversy cautiously welcome Mr Justice Charles Meenan\u0026rsquos reportMurder trial hears details of transactions by Dubliner whose dismembered remains were found in canalMinister of State passed on dinner invite from bidder for contract to Denis NaughtenAnn O\u0026rsquoDonnell, aka Jax Miller, published debut Freedom Child in 2015Take Back the City group occupied vacant building which is to be turned in apartmentsChild has faint marking on her arm which is difficult to see at conversational distance, court toldINMO executive to meet in early November to decide on next stepsFintan Smith says incident in 2012 caused embarrassment and discomfort in familyLabour leader says potentially \u0026lsquodangerous\u0026rsquo development has to be resisted by IrelandTrial continues of Anthony Walsh (31) who has pleaded not guilty to murdering Dermot ByrneAspects of \u0026euro5m bill disputed after marathon action over public rights of way across historic estateChild strapped into rear of mother\u0026rsquos car when it was involved in serious road collisionReport one year after Ophelia said wind speeds reached 156kmh in Co CorkSome 87 people in North were attacked by paramilitaries in 201718Applicant was 17 when she came to Ireland in 2014 and sought refugee status\u0026lsquoUnprecedented\u0026rsquo number of applicants led to dozens of ticket holders being refused entryIrish Nurses and Midwives Organisation says worst overcrowding is Limerick hospitalMore than 100 personnel from the 57th Infantry Group had been due back at start of OctoberGarda became suspicious of a van in Offaly and followed it as it drove towards Dublin"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665369.1539694918!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit howlin hearing that deal on backstop may be postponed","story":"Labour leader Brendan Howlin has claimed that the prospect of postponing the issue of the Irish “backstop” is being discussed in the Brexit talks as negotiations enter a critical phase. Mr Howlin said he had been talking to colleagues in the Party of European Socialists and had heard such a suggestion from a “variety of sources”. He said this must be resisted by Ireland. The EU says the backstop - which would avoid a hard border in Ireland by aligning Northern Ireland to the EU single market and customs union if no wider EU-UK deal is reached - must be included in the Brexit withdrawal agreement.The agreement was expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, but the talks have become stuck on the backstop. “I had hoped that the decision would be made to have a clear outline of what the backstop would be at the June summit,” he told reporters at Leinster House. “I said if it was deferred there was a real danger of becoming the critical issue, not only in October but beyond and would actually muddy the waters in relation to the exit deal. “Talking to colleagues across Europe, I now hear for the first time, that there are actually suggestions being made that the Irish backstop issue be postponed. That is very dangerous for us that is something we have to resist but it was highly predictable.”“And until that is resolved, there will be no discussions on future trade. If we allow that issue to get kicked down the road, if it is not resolved now, we could find ourselves in a very lonely situation.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The margin of error is plus or minus 2.8 per cent.The “core” vote for the parties – that is, before undecideds were excluded – compared with the last  poll in April, was: Fine Gael 26 per cent (up two) Fianna Fáil 20 per cent (down one) Labour 3 per cent (down one) Sinn Féin 19 per cent (up one) Independentsothers 11 per cent (down one). Undecided voters were at 21 per cent, unchanged since the last poll.Among the smaller parties and independents, the Green Party is at 2 per cent (down 1) among voters declaring a preference, Solidarity-People Before Profit are at 3 per cent (up 1), the Social Democrats are at 1 per cent (no change), Independents for Change are at 2 per cent (up 1), the Independent Alliance is at 1 per cent (no change), non-party Independents are on 4 per cent (down 2) and other groups and parties are on 2 per cent (no change).Fianna Fáil supporters are evenly split – 46 per cent each – on whether the confidence and supply agreement should go on while 70 per cent of those declaring a preference for Fine Gael favour its continuation.Nearly a fifth (19 per cent) say the budget will leave them better off, while 14 per cent say they will be worse off. A large majority, however, say it will make no difference.Asked if the Government was right to favour public spending increases over tax cuts, 42 per cent say the Government was right, while 47 per cent would have preferred more tax cuts.Government satisfaction declines by five points to 39 per cent since April, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s approval rating slips by four points to 51 per cent.Nationally, Fianna Fáil is a few points ahead of where it was before the 2016 election, though its support in Dublin still lags, at 19 per cent.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsAs Taoiseach Leo Varadkar mulls what may be the most fateful decision of his political career – the future of the confidence-and-supply agreement and the prospects for an early general election – today’s opinion poll will encourage those around Varadkar who are beating the election drums.Parties want to fight elections when they are strong, and today’s numbers show that Fine Gael maintains a strong eight-point lead over Fianna Fáil.A year ago, it was two points. In that period it has gone from two to 11 to nine to five and then to eight today. Polls fluctuate, and there’s a margin of error. Things change during a campaign. But there’s a pretty consistent trend of Fine Gael leading Fianna Fáil now. The average in polls over the last year is eight points. Reproduced on election day, it would give Varadkar a commanding lead and put him in a strong position to lead the next government.The Fianna Fáil leader is looking over both his shoulders at his often restive party, fed up with playing second fiddle to Fine Gael, and at Sinn Féin, within touching distance of him today.Neither challenge is new to Micheál Martin, currently engaged in a delicate dance with Varadkar over the extension of confidence and supply. But never has his leadership of his party looked more like juggling on a tightrope than it does today. He has managed the task with some aplomb but it must be a fraught business for his inner circle.Two important caveats, based on past experience, should be added to these numbers, though. One is that in the last election, Fianna Fáil support increased in the general election campaign period. And it did in the one before that too. That suggests that there are some natural or historic party loyalists who tend to “come home” during a campaign. That might not happen again of course but precedent suggests there’s a good chance it will.The second thing is that Sinn Féin’s support on election day rarely matches their mid-term levels. What tends to happen is the party’s support peaks between elections but falls off towards polling day. In October 2014, the party was at 24 per cent it fell back to 14 per cent by the 2016 election. Today, it’s back at 24 per cent. Mary Lou McDonald may have changed the profile of the party but has she changed it enough?The aggregate support for the fourth pillar of Irish politics, the Independents (governing and non-governing alike) and small parties (not including Labour), slips again today, down two points to 14 per cent. This is less than half the 30 per cent that this umbrella grouping received in the last general election, before some of their number joined the Government.Though it protests it is not a party – and certainly lacks the coherence of one – the Independent Alliance seems to be experiencing the traditional fate of a small party in coalition with a larger one: decimation. Its support registers at just 1 per cent nationally today.It is not alone in that. All the minnows register in the 1-2-3 per cent range: Solidarity-People Before Profit (3 per cent) The Greens (2 per cent) the Social Democrats (1 per cent) Independents for Change (2 per cent) other groupings or parties (1 per cent) not stated (1 per cent). Only those who respondents say are “not a member of any group” (4 per cent) get their noses past 3 per cent. It has long been apparent that one of the post-crash effects on Irish politics was a fracturing of a part of the political spectrum. Today’s poll confirms that the fractions are getting smaller.Labour, meanwhile, trundles along with little sign of a revival. It is down one today to four per cent.Varadkar doesn’t get things all his own way. His satisfaction slips by four points today (after falling by five in April), though it remains high by recent historical comparison. Satisfaction with the Government also falls away, down by five points to 39 per cent, though again that is high by post-crash standards. The other party leaders are largely unchanged.Voters are underwhelmed by Paschal Donohoe’s budget, with the great majority of voters saying that it will make no difference to them. Even Fine Gael supporters shrug at it.However, Varadkar – one-time champion of tax cuts for those who get up early in the morning – will likely note that almost half of voters (47 per cent) would have preferred a greater emphasis on tax cuts rather than public spending increases in the budget.But it is the findings today about the public’s attitude to a general election that will attract most interest in political circles, as everyone watches Varadkar and Martin circle each other warily.Voters are pretty evenly ided on whether they want the present Government to continue, or to have an election. The view in some circles that the public are firmly against an election – and that anyone who caused one would be punished – is not borne out here.Brexit remains a significant barrier to an election – and in truth, it is difficult to see how either major party leader could prompt one in the midst of such uncertainty – but the voters appear pretty sanguine on the question. That will come as a surprise. Rarely has the immediate future of Irish politics looked more unpredictable."},{"url":null,"title":"the obama style candidate trying to turn the tide in texas","story":"  October 13, 2018Democrats hope Beto O\u0026rsquoRourke will beat Ted Cruz to the Senate in the US mid-terms   October 12, 2018For every Mike Pence there is a Tim Kaine or Joe Biden who support abortion rights "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.3657023.1539082433!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit the","story":"The UK voted to leave the European Union on June 23rd\u0026nbsp2016 by a majority of 51.9 to 48.1 per cent, with a turnout of just under 72 per cent. This set the UK on course to leave the EU, but left all the details of its exit still to be decided. The timetable was set the following March 29th, when British prime minister Theresa May took the formal step, required under EU law to start the exit process, of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Under the two-year process the UK will leave the EU on March 29th, 2019. An extension to the exit period is possible\u0026nbspif all 28 EU members agree. However negotiations have been taking place on the assumption that the UK leaves in March 2019.\u0026nbspThe talks between the UK and EU started in June 2017 and so far have focused on the details of the UK’s withdrawal, which must be set down in a formal, legal agreement. Outline agreement has been reached on what the UK will pay the EU after departure – the so-called exit bill or orce bill – and on the mutual recognition of the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. However on the other crucial issue related to the withdrawal agreement, a backstop for the Irish Border, an agreement is still being sought.\u0026nbspThe backstop is a legally operable text which would provide a guarantee that there be no hard Border on the island of Ireland no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK.\u0026nbspBefore the UK leaves, the two sides must also agree a political declaration outlining the principles for future negotiations. Under the withdrawal agreement, a so-called transition period, a kind of standstill in current arrangements, would apply from March 2019 until December 2020. This is to allow future trade arrangements and the wider ongoing relationship between the EU and UK to be negotiated.For a country to leave the EU is unprecedented ‑ and the extent of the complications has\u0026nbspslowly become evident\u0026nbspin the last couple of years. EU membership is a central part of the economy and society of all its members and unscrambling this is very complex, before account is even taken of sketching out how the two sides will relate to each other in future.Much of the discussion has been about the UK’s membership of the EU trading bloc. There are two elements to this. First, the UK is part of the EU customs union. This is a free trade area under which allows goods to circulate freely through the EU. Part of this is a commitment by all members to impose the same import tariffs – or taxes – on goods entering from outside the EU.The UK is also part of the EU single market, the system of rules and regulations which allow free movement of goods, services, people and capital. Together, membership of the customs union and single market allows goods to move freely across the EU and also for free trade in services like banking. Common EU regulations also underpin trade in a host of different areas, for example pharmaceuticals and food.The single market also allows free movement of people across the EU. The UK is also involved in common international policies co-ordinated at EU level, notably in foreign policy and defence and in trade deals with other countries.Current formal discussions are focusing on managing the UK’s exit. However there is also significant debate, in the UK in particular, about how areas like trade and immigration will work in future.Brexit talks between the UK and the EU are taking place in a sequenced order, which has led to no little confusion in the debate. What has to be decided upon now are the terms on which the UK leaves.These will be contained in the withdrawal agreement. A political declaration on what the future relationship might look like also has to be agreed before the UK leaves. However, details of the future relationship between the EU and UK will be decided in talks after the UK actually leaves, assuming the two sides are still talking.In the short term the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement would mean that once the UK leaves next March a transition period, a kind of standstill, would commence and last until the end of 2020. If this happens, not much will change next March, except for the UK’s formal departure.If there is no withdrawal agreement, then the UK would leave the EU in a so-called “no-deal” Brexit in March 2019, which could be chaotic as barriers to trade would go up overnight and there would be uncertainties in areas ranging from aviation to pharmaceuticals to co-operation in nuclear regulation. There is speculation that the EU and UK would work together to try to avoid the worst of the chaos – though they could only do so much ‑ \u0026nbspor even that there might be late moves to delay the UK’s exit date.If a withdrawal agreement is finalised, then talks move on to how the two sides will relate in future in areas such as foreign policy, defence and security and, crucially for Ireland, trade.In terms of trade, the UK could have a close relationship with the EU – like Norway, which follows many EU rules and regulations and is in the single market – or have a free trade deal with the EU, like Canada.The crunch point is that the EU insists that the UK must either be fully in the EU trading bloc and accept all the rules, or be out of it, and have a relationship similar to the EU and Canada. For the UK, the more closely aligned it remains with the EU, the less freedom it will have to set its own economic course after Brexit.The UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc too so checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.The economic impact of Brexit is negative, for both the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU. The biggest impact will be in the UK itself and in Ireland, its closest trading partner. \u0026nbspFor the UK, any trade arrangement reached after Brexit – barring full membership of the EU trading bloc, which the UK has ruled out – will be less favourable than current arrangements. Economists say that any new trade opportunities elsewhere will not make up for losses in trade with the EU. Weaker sterling since Brexit has already cut the purchasing power of UK consumers and uncertainty has hit investment, with growth estimated to be 1 to 2 per cent per annum lower over the couple of years.For Ireland, growth remains strong and the main short-term impact has been via a weaker sterling exchange rate, which is good if you’re going to the UK to buy a second-hand car but bad if you’re an exporter to the UK market.\u0026nbspThe main long-term threat to Brexit comes from barriers to exports to the UK and also delays and higher prices for importers of UK goods to Ireland. Forecasters have estimated that in a harder version of Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU trading bloc, the Irish economy could be 4 to 7 per cent lower in a decade’s time, with most of the hit in the first five years.May meets fellow EU leaders and the European Commission to try to seal deals on the terms of Britain’s withdrawal and what kind of relationship it has in the future. This should cover trade and how to prevent a return of controls on the Border. These are the main areas of disagreement which have all but stalled negotiations and caused May’s government to step up preparations for leaving without any deal.Both sides are still working towards an October deadline, although it may be possible to extend that to December and still allow time for both sides to approve the deal. \u0026nbspEuropean Council president Donald Tusk has described the October summit as “the moment of truth” for Brexit negotiations. If, however, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier tells EU leaders at that summit in Brussels that a deal is within touching distance, then he will recommend a special summit of EU leaders be held in mid-November, most likely some time during the week beginning November 12th.An EU Council meeting is also planned for December 13th and 14th.British parliamentary vote on Brexit deal - unscheduled.If May secures a deal, she has to get parliament to approve it. Her Conservatives hold 316 seats in the 650-seat lower house, and she relies on Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party to win parliamentary votes.To win approval, she must overcome differences between Conservatives who want a radical break with Brussels, and those who want closer ties.Otherwise, she may have to look to the opposition for support. Both paths are full of uncertainty.Failure could trigger a move against her leadership of the Conservative Party, or the government’s collapse and an early election.The UK is schedule to leave the European Union on this date."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665273.1539697453!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit more time needed to reach agreement says barnier","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May has urged the European Union not to allow a stand-off over the so-called Irish backstop to derail the Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was achievable.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator has said more time is needed to reach agreement on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and that a solution must be found to ensure “no hard border in any circumstance on the island of Ireland”.His comments come as British prime minister Theresa May is due to address leaders of the EU27 on Wednesday evening in Brussels. She will then leave them to discuss the next steps on Brexit over dinner in her absence.Michel Barnier said the Brexit process must be “orderly for everyone and in all subjects – including Ireland”.Meanwhile, Germany has urged Ms May to “take responsibility” for Brexit. Germany’s Europe minister Michael Roth said: “The situation is very serious . . . All involved must now look into whether the compromises made have been sufficient. For us, it is clear, we want a fair deal with the GB. But it must be a deal that preserves the integrity of the single market.”Mr Roth said his message to Mrs May is, “take responsibility and be constructive”.While the UK was demanding “flexibility” from Brussels, the EU was limited in its room for manoeuvre because of the need to keep the Irish Border open, he said.“We can have either a smooth Brexit or rocky one,” said France’s EU affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau. “We all prefer a smooth one but we have to stand ready if there is no deal.”EU leaders have scrapped plans to discuss and publish a draft declaration this week on the bloc’s future trade deal with the UK after the derailment of the talks over the Border, in a blow to Ms May. An outline of an agreement was due to be “on the table” at a summit dinner of leaders on Wednesday night. When Brexit secretary Dominic Raab refused to sign off on an agreement on the Border have carefully choreographed plans came to a halt.Mrs May briefed her senior ministers in an extended session of cabinet ahead of Wednesday’s crunch meeting.There was strong support from cabinet ministers for Mrs May’s insistence that any Brexit deal must maintain the integrity of the union and cannot keep the UK indefinitely in a backstop customs arrangement, said Mrs May’s spokesman.Foreign ministers from the remaining 27 EU states were receiving a briefing from Mr Barnier at the General Affairs Council.Mr Barneir said he hopes a deal with Britain is possible “in the coming weeks”.With no likelihood of a deal this week, a special Brexit summit is expected to be scheduled for November. But it remains unclear whether this will be framed as a final opportunity to reach agreement or as a chance for the 27 to make preparations for a disorderly no-deal withdrawal.The prime minister told the House of Commons on Monday that an exit agreement is still “achievable”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said because the UK is “determined to leave the customs union and the single market, because the UK says it wants bilateral trade deals” the Government must insist on the backstop.This is “to protect the island of Ireland and the two jurisdictions on it, ensuring . . . normality between communities trading with each other, that that isn’t undermined as an unintended consequence of Brexit,” he said.Speaking ahead of a private meeting on Tuesday in Luxembourg with Mr Barnier, the Tánaiste said he is confident that the Barnier taskforce, and Mr Barnier himself, “will deliver a deal that is consistent with what’s already been committed to in these negotiations, which is not an unreasonable ask”.Mr Coveney is meeting with Mr Barnier to discuss the current state of play in negotiations. And in particular talks on the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop on avoiding a hard border.“Our bottom line on this is that we must have a backstop in the withdrawal treaty,” said Mr Coveney. “That backstop cannot be time limited in terms of an end date. It needs to be there unless and until something better is negotiated and agreed.” – Additional reporting agencies.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

While on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves make more than eight times more than the have-nots. Photograph: GettyBulgarians and visitors to their capital Sofia were offered a dazzling show of ancient and modern wealth earlier this year. The country’s national gallery, housed in an elegant former royal palace, displayed 62 glittering treasures dating back to 1,000BC in an exhibition called “The Golden Fleece. The Quest of the Argonauts”.It included 16 pieces that were on show for the first time, having resided in the well-guarded storehouses of the Thrace Foundation, a creation of multi-millionaire businessman Vassil Bojkov. The exhibition brought some cultural sparkle to Bulgaria’s six-month presidency of the EU, and may also have added a little lustre to Bojkov’s shadowy reputation.Established in 2004, the Thrace Foundation says it funds research and improves access to museums and protection of cultural heritage while caring for its founder’s collection of more than 3,000 precious artefacts.Bojkov, whose name is sometimes spelled Vasil Bozhkov, is thought to be Bulgaria’s richest man, with an empire ning construction to gambling operations that he built during his nation’s chaotic and sometimes bloody switch from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. With the Thrace Foundation perhaps the tycoon nicknamed “The Skull” is trying to give something back to the poorest and most unequal country in the EU.Some 11 years after Bulgaria joined the EU – raising hopes for a swift rise in prosperity, a more robust democracy and broader social justice – data from Eurostat in Brussels now make for bleak reading.Bulgaria has the lowest average salary in the EU (€575), the lowest minimum wage (€260) and the smallest average pension (€190).The upshot is that more than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion – twice the proportion of Germans who find themselves in the same predicament.In addition, while on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves\u0026nbspmake more than eight times more than the have-nots – without accounting for undeclared wealth.“There are three Bulgarian realities,” says Daniel Kaddik, the Sofia-based director of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in southeast Europe.“People with an average salary don’t live a good life here, with prices for food, energy and other things that are comparable with elsewhere in Europe.”“Then there is a relatively small middle class who have their own bubble, and work in start-ups or international companies, and live in some areas of Sofia that are comparable with parts of Berlin, for example.”“Then there’s the upper class, which is detached from everything else. They have very fancy cars and private members’ clubs, and there is very often an overlap with shady business.”“I lived in Berlin and I never saw a Maybach,” he adds. “In Sofia I’ve already seen three.”The economy is growing at around 3.5 per cent, but the World Bank says it needs to expand “by at least 4 per cent per year over the next 25 years for Bulgaria to catch up with average EU income levels and thus boost shared prosperity”.Bulgaria leads the EU when it comes to one unpalatable indicator – the prevalence of corruption, and graft is draining the economy, scaring away foreign investors and serving to keep people poor.The country was the EU’s most corrupt nation in the latest Transparency International index, ranking in 71st place alongside South Africa and Vanuatu.Just as alarmingly, an EU survey found last year that only one-quarter of Bulgarians would trust the police to deal with a corruption complaint, and police and customs officers are seen as the public servants most likely to take bribes.The European Parliament estimates that corruption costs Bulgaria about 15 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and graft reaches into every facet of life – from rigged tenders, opaque contracts and kickbacks in multimillion-euro deals to the need for ordinary citizens to pay bribes to smooth their path through the country’s health and education systems and its Byzantine bureaucracy.All these backhanders, big and small, feed a grey economy in Bulgaria that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found last year was equivalent to 29.6 per cent of its GDP, the largest such share in the EU.The result is a debilitating cycle of tax evasion and capital flight, depleted revenues for the government, sub-standard services for the public, and a grinding sense of injustice, grievance and mistrust towards officials and state institutions.An EU survey last year found that when it came to achieving success in life, more than twice as many Bulgarians believe that “knowing the right people” is a bigger factor than having a good education.This feeling that the game is rigged in favour of those with connections, and that poverty is permanent, is writ large in Bulgarian demographics - young people are leaving, couples are having fewer children and the population is falling fast.The UN says Bulgaria is actually the world’s fastest shrinking nation, with its current population of about 7 million people expected to dwindle to 5.4 million by 2050 and 3.9 million by the end of the century.Bulgaria has already lost almost 2 million people from a peak of nearly 9 million in 1989, revealing the massive and long-term impact of the transition from communism to capitalism on eastern Europe - where eight other countries are also expected to suffer a population decline of more than 15 per cent by 2050.The EU’s highest mortality rate, coupled with one of the bloc’s lowest birth rate and the emigration of tens of thousands of workers each year, leave Bulgaria with a headache over how to fund pensions and healthcare for an ageing population.It is no surprise that tens of thousands of Bulgarians seek jobs abroad each year, with Germany, Britain and Spain their favoured destinations, creating a chronic shortage of staff in country’s health service, schools and other major sectors.“There are now places where you don’t have doctor within radius of 50km. You have to bring own toilet paper to the hospital and these kinds of things. It’s a climate that lots of people just don’t want to live in anymore,” says Kaddik.While young professionals are leaving home in search of higher wages, better working conditions and a less corrupt environment, many Bulgarians do not even wait until graduation to start looking abroad for opportunities.About 17 per cent of Bulgarian students went to a foreign university last year, and some of the country’s top universities are now trying to fill hundreds of empty places for the new term.A glimmer of good news for people returning from abroad is that they will probably find the family home waiting. About 84 per cent of Bulgarians own the place where they live, compared to just 53 per cent in Germany.“People were given the apartments where they were living (when communism collapsed) and they are lucky to own their homes, otherwise they simply could not afford their housing,” says Kaddik.“A lot of Bulgarians, especially the elderly, rely on food grown on a little family plot outside the city. The family bond is strong here, and among friends and relatives there is a lot of exchange of small services and helping each other out – but it’s out of necessity because of a lack of good services.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Saudi Arabia preparing to acknowledge journalist\u0026rsquos death, say reportsLabor Party, the Greens and crossbenchers combine to vote down the statementUS president takes phone call from King Salman and appears to accept Saudi denialsUS will inflict \u0026lsquosevere punishment\u0026rsquo if the kingdom is found to be responsibleNot even royals are exempt from being \u0026lsquodisappeared\u0026rsquo by despotic Wahhabist regimeInvestigators tell US counterparts recordings prove journalist was killed in Saudi embassyBritain seeking \u0026lsquourgent answers\u0026rsquo following disappearance of Jamal KhashoggiDate set by Russia and Turkey aiming to impose lasting ceasefire in Syrian provinceOfficials believe the missing Jamal Khashoggi was killed in the consulateJamal Khashoggi has not been seen since entering Istanbul building several days agoNuzha secondary school in Jordan faced closure due to US withdrawal of $300m fundsUnrwa will have to launch a supreme effort to make up for the lack of US fundsUS president puts pressure on King Salman over rising oil pricesFormer beauty queen Tara al-Fares was shot while sitting in car in BaghdadStrike took place at 2am and targeted bases of \u0026lsquotakfiri terrorists\u0026rsquo backed by AmericaBoys were hit by sniper fire near perimeter fence surrounding Gaza as protests escalateMahmoud Abbas tells assembly Trump has reneged on all previous US commitmentsMoscow and Ankara seek demilitarised buffer zone in Syrian province to avert disasterMoscow says it will supply advanced S-300 system after one of its planes was downedDeaths of at least 25 in military parade in Ahvaz escalates tensions with Gulf states and US"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665260.1539693725!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pompeo meets saudi king over khashoggi s disappearance","story":"CCTV footage obtained by TRT World shows Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 before he disappeared.

Photograph: Leah MillisPoolReuters US secretary of state Mike Pompeo met Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman at his palace in Riyadh on Tuesday over the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul two weeks ago. “I hope you are comfortable here,” the king told Mr Pompeo, according to the reporters. Mr Pompeo responded, “Thank you for accepting my visit on behalf of President Trump.”US president Donald Trump dispatched Mr Pompeo to meet the king over the case that has strained the Americans’ relationship with the Saudis, carefully cultivated by the US president.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is preparing to acknowledge the death of Mr Khashoggi in a botched interrogation, CNN and the New York Times said on Monday, after US president Donald Trump speculated “rogue killers” may be responsible.Mr Khashoggi, a US resident, Washington Post columnist and leading critic of the powerful Saudi crown prince vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago to get marriage documents. Turkish officials say they believe he was murdered there and his body removed.Members of his family called for an investigation, in a statement released on Monday.“We are sadly and anxiously following the conflicting news regarding the fate of our father after losing contact with him two weeks ago,” they said.“The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death.”Citing two unidentified sources, CNN said on Monday that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report that would acknowledge Mr Khashoggi was killed as the result of an interrogation that went wrong. The Saudi government could not be reached immediately for comment on the CNN report.“I heard that report, but nobody knows if it’s an official report,” Mr Trump told reporters, without elaborating.The New York Times, citing a person familiar with the Saudi plans, reported the crown prince had approved an interrogation or rendition of Mr Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government, it said, would shield the prince by blaming an intelligence official for the bungled operation.The case has provoked an international outcry against Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, with more media and business executives pulling out of a planned investment conference there this month.While organisers said Monday the conference will go on, the Saudis cancelled an annual diplomatic reception in Washington set for later this week.Many members of the US Congress, which has long had a testy relationship with Saudi Arabia, have issued strong criticism of the kingdom over the case.Turkish authorities have an audio recording indicating that Mr Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, a Turkish official and a security source told Reuters, and have shared evidence with countries including Saudi Arabia and the United States. They provided no further details.Saudi Arabia has strongly denied killing Mr Khashoggi and has denounced such assertions as “lies,” saying he left the building shortly after entering.“The king firmly denied any knowledge of it,” Mr Trump told reporters after speaking with King Salman. “He didn’t really know, maybe - I don’t want to get into his mind but it sounded to me - maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?”The US president gave no evidence to support the theory. Democratic lawmakers criticised Mr Trump for using the term “rogue killers”.“Been hearing the ridiculous “rogue killers” theory was where the Saudis would go with this,” Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy said on Twitter.“Absolutely extraordinary they were able to enlist the President of the United States as their PR agent to float it.”Mr Trump called Mr Pompeo on Sunday night and asked him to have face-to-face meetings with the Saudi leaders, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.Mr Trump said Mr Pompeo may go to Turkey after Saudi Arabia.Turkish police investigators entered the Istanbul consulate late on Monday. A Turkish diplomatic source had earlier said a joint Turkish-Saudi team would search the building - the last place Mr Khashoggi was seen before he vanished on October 2nd.“It has been 13 days since the event, so surely proving some of the evidence might be difficult” the Turkish official said.Turkish authorities will also search the residence of the top Saudi diplomat in Istanbul the missing journalist, a Turkish foreign ministry official has said.A Saudi official, not authorised to speak publicly, told Reuters that the king had ordered an internal investigation based on information from the joint team in Istanbul.Mr Trump has threatened “severe punishment” if it turns out Mr Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, although he has ruled out cancelling arms deals worth tens of billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia. European allies have urged “a credible investigation” and accountability for those responsible.Mr Khashoggi, a familiar face on Arab talk shows, moved to the United States last year fearing retribution for his criticism of Prince Mohammed, who has cracked down on dissent with arrests.A pro-government Turkish daily published preliminary evidence last week from investigators who it said had identified a 15-member Saudi intelligence team that arrived in Istanbul on diplomatic passports hours before Khashoggi disappeared.The Saudi consulate referred Reuters to authorities in Riyadh, who did not respond to questions about the 15 Saudis.Saudi Arabia has responded to Western statements by saying it would retaliate against any pressure or economic sanctions “with greater action,” and Arab allies rallied to support it.–Reuters "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665493.1539699947!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish ambassador criticises british backsliding on backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland’s ambassador to London Adrian O’Neill: “A backstop that has a time limit on it ceases to be a backstop.” Photograph: Brian O’Leary Ireland’s ambassador to London Adrian O’Neill has expressed concerns about British “backsliding” over the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop by demanding it should be time limited. Mr O’Neill said Britain had agreed last December, and again in March, that there should be a backstop that would operate unless and until a permanent solution was found to keep the Border open. “There seems to be some degree of backsliding on those insofar as this demand for a time-limited version of the backstop is not consistent with what was agreed in December and March. We are concerned by that. A backstop that has a time limit on it ceases to be a backstop,” he said. Mr O’Neill told a seminar hosted by the British Academy and the Royal Irish Academy that it was “disappointing and concerning” that there had not been more progress made on Northern Ireland. And he criticised some pro-Brexit voices in Britain who have dismissed the need for a legally-binding guarantee that there should be no hard border. “It is even more concerning when we hear comments from some quarters here that the backstop is unnecessary – allegedly an irrelevant distraction hindering the achievement of a clean-break Brexit and frustrating the achievement of the grand vision of a free-trading global Britain,” he said. “Such arguments are of course entirely self-serving – intended to minimise or entirely dismiss the need for a robust solution to the Border problem. The truth – however inconvenient for some – is that the backstop for Northern Ireland is a crucial safety net for the BelfastGood Friday Agreement and for protecting the gains of a peace process which benefit all the people on these islands.” British prime minister Theresa May told MPs on Monday that any backstop cannot be limited to Northern Ireland and must keep the whole of the UK inside a customs arrangement with the EU. She also said that it must be time limited, although she held back from calling for a specific date on which it should end. Britain wants a UK-wide customs backstop to be written into the legally-binding withdrawal agreement but the EU says it must instead be part of a political declaration on the future relationship. Mr O’Neill suggested that the EU could only move from its current position if Britain offered up-front guarantees of a “level playing field” on issues like competition policy, workers rights and the environment. “I think there are some genuine constraints about how far the EU can go. It’s not just about a pedantic legalism that prevents people from dealing with certain issues in the withdrawal process which are for the future relationship. There are definite concerns around how much you can do around customs union arrangements in a withdrawal treaty without also similarly addressing in a watertight way issues around a level playing field,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But when her Boko Haram handler escorted her to the target, she recognised faces in the crowd as former neighbours. She hesitated just long enough for police to arrive.A year on, Aisha is among hundreds of ex-Boko Haram captives at a rehabilitation charity in Maiduguri, the dusty city in north-east Nigeria where the country\u0027s jihadist movement sprang up.Recovering from life in a group that treats women as either sex slaves or cannon fodder is not easy: Aisha was so traumatised that she was mute for the first few months, while others are plagued by nightmares, flashbacks and thoughts of suicide.Yet for Fatima Akilu, the NHS-trained psychologist who runs the charity, what is equally disturbing is that not every former hostage regrets their time with the group.In the remote, impoverished villages where Boko Haram has its strongholds, becoming a bush wife is the closest some women ever get to empowerment.A teacher holds a counselling session for boys at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, NigeriaIt isn\u0027t true of all cases, but some of the wives of senior Boko Haram commanders have told me that while they were with the group, they felt empowered for the first time in their lives, said Dr Akilu, a Nigerian Muslim is also a children\u0027s author.They\u0027d often be in command of a harem of women themselves, sometimes hundreds of them, and they\u0027d learn how to use weapons as well.They felt a power they\u0027d never have in their own communities, where they\u0027d usually get married aged 12, and where husbands would then dictate their lives.Counterintuitive though they may be, Dr Akilu\u0027s insights draw on a lifetime studying the murkier side of the human psyche.Educated at boarding school in Tunbridge Wells, she studied psychiatry in Britain and the US before working with young offenders, paedophiles and murderers, including John Hinckley Jr, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan.In 2012, Nigeria\u0027s National Security Agency asked her to devise a local equivalent to Britain\u0027s Prevent counter-extremism project, after reading articles she had written on the role of education in fighting radicalism.How the Nigerian government is fuelling Boko Haram\u0026#039s kidnapping industryAs Director for Behavioural Analysis, she ran prison deradicalisation programs for jailed Boko Haram commanders and their wives, before setting up her own charity, the Neem Foundation, in 2016. It aims to help the tens of thousands of other Nigerians who have spent time in Boko Haram camps, be it voluntarily or as hostages.The group, which has killed an estimated 20,000 people, remains a force to be reckoned with, despite losing much of its turf in the past three years. It still holds around 100 of the 276 schoolgirls snatched from the town of Chibok in 2014, and last month also killed one of three kidnapped local aid workers.But as well as the ongoing military struggle, there is now a hearts and minds challenge to re-integrate those once brainwashed by the group. There are thousands of these people now drifting back into cities and refugee camps,” Dr Akilu said. “They need help, otherwise the problems could last for decades.”At a compound down a backstreet in Maiduguri, the Neem Foundation provides a school for female ex-captives, which is often their first experience of a classroom.\u0026#34Amina\u0026#34, a 17-year-old former hostage of Boko Haram at the Neem Foundation school in Bakassi refugee camp in Maiduguri. She spent 18 months with the groupConducted in English rather than local languages, it is a rebuff to Boko Haram\u0027s mantra that Western education is sinful, although the syllabus goes beyond just the 3Rs. Diversity is an important lesson too, given the inter-tribal chauvinism that Boko Haram exploits.A lot of our pupils are brought up to believe that their own tribe is greatest, be they Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri (the latter the tribe of Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau), said Aisha Bukar, the school\u0027s deputy head. By getting them to swap tribes in role-plays, we teach them that Nigeria is a place of many tribes and faiths.Indeed, a few of the program\u0027s clients are unaware that Nigeria even exists as a country, thinking it represents just the wider area around their village.Such limited horizons make them easy prey for Boko Haram’s doctrines, which include the bizarre claim that the world is flat. It also lets the group present itself variously as a world-conquering jihadist force, a glamorous Mafia, and even a local version of the Boy Scouts.There\u0027s a whole range of reasons why people join up, mostly to do with lack of opportunity, said Dr Akilu. For some, it\u0027s the chance to be in a gang and carry a gun. For others, especially adolescents, it\u0027s just a chance to be part of something, to have an adventure. Then there some who join up because Boko Haram gave them money to start a business. It may be just cash to buy a wheelbarrow, but that means the world to people in communities that have nothing.She stresses that despite such blandishments, Boko Haram still has to recruit most of its followers by force. Yet stigma abounds.In a refugee camp where the charity runs another program, Amina Ahmed, 17, who was impregnated by her captors and then miscarried, told how even her own mother blamed her at first. She asked me: \u0027why did you accept?\u0027, and I told her it was because I had no choice, she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. Here I can at least meet other people who\u0027ve had the same problems.A \u0026#34conflict resolution\u0026#34 class at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Bakassi refugee camp in MaiduguriTo date, the Neem Foundation has helped more than 7,000 people affected by Boko Haram, some via a special counselling on wheels service that sends staff out to remoter areas. How successful it will be, only time will tell, although Dr Akilu does already have an endorsement from one important source.During her time working with Boko Haram\u0027s jailed commanders, she persuaded one of the group\u0027s chief imams to back her program, after months of fiery debate about different interpretations of Islam.  He was one of the main leaders who opposed Western education, but halfway through the program, he changed his mind and decided he\u0027d been misleading people. she said.

Authorities have justified the crackdown as a necessary part of counter-terrorism efforts.Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang governor, defends China\u0026#39s internment camps for Muslim minorities as programs that have \u0026#34enhanced\u0026#34 livesAs many as one million Uighurs have been forced into internment camps where they undergo political indoctrination and abuse. Human rights groups have condemned the detentions as unlawful and inhumane.Experts say authorities are on the offensive ahead of a major scheduled review of China’s human rights record at the United Nations in early November. Rather than continuing to deny the camps\u0027 existence, authorities are working to reframe the discussion.Mr Zakir’s comments “are an attempt to whitewash the reality of why people are sent to these camps and what happens inside them,” said Frances Eve, a researcher for the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a coalition of rights groups.“These so-called ‘trainees’ are not given an opportunity to challenge the designation of ‘extremist behaviour’ nor the deprivation of their liberty in front of a judge,” she said. “China should allow international experts from the UN into Xinjiang to investigate the camps unhindered instead of engaging in a propaganda campaign.”China first changed course in an unprecedented move last week when authorities acknowledged and legalised the camps, even providing details about the “re-education” efforts.The revised law now allows for “vocational skill education training centres” to “carry out anti-extremist ideological education” and implement “psychological and behavioural correction to promote thought transformation of trainees, and help them return to society and family.”Mr Zakir has provided the government’s most specific account to date. His claims, however, stand in contrast to what human rights groups say former detainees have described – physical and psychological abuse, overcrowding and sometimes even death inside the camps.“These rampant abuses violate fundamental rights to freedom of expression, religion, and privacy, and protections from torture and unfair trials,” said a Human Rights Watch report.For years, China has waged a crackdown in Xinjiang, banning any “extremist’ activity such as wearing a headscarf, or growing “abnormal” beards. Women have even had their tunics cut short.Increased oversight in Xinjiang, which includes monitoring residents via facial recognition, mobile phone scans, DNA collection and scores of security cameras, have been justified by officials as efforts to combat extremism and prevent violent terrorist activity.Please review our commenting policyTory MP broke election spending rules to kill off Nigel Farage\u0026#39s dream of entering Parliament, court toldPoland\u0026#39s ruling party pressures cinemas to stop showing blockbuster film about Catholic Church abuseSpeaker John Bercow under huge pressure to resign after Maria Miller and Sir Kevin Barron tell him to goNicole Kidman says being married to Tom Cruise protected her from sexual harassment in Hollywood Leftist French leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon broadcasts police search on party HQ liveTurkish police searching for missing journalist found fresh coats of paint in Saudi consulate, Erdogan revealsIreland accuses UK of \u0026#39backsliding\u0026#39 on Brexit promises Three dead after car towing caravan drives wrong way down M40The warring factions Theresa May must pacify in her parliamentary tightrope walk to a Brexit dealFacebook, Google and Twitter forced to remove 30 million illegal and offensive posts in just 3 monthsPeter Dinklage hints at Tyrion\u0026#39s final fate in Game of ThronesPaedophile accused of murdering two schoolgirls goes on trial 30 years after he was acquittedComment: Brexiteers can\u0026#39t replace Theresa May, but that doesn\u0026#39t mean they don\u0026#39t hold swayComment: It shouldn\u0026#39t be up to tech giants to police hate speech, but they must contribute to the costEmmanuel Macron finally announces reshuffle in bid to reverse plummeting political fortunesAnt McPartlin and wife\u0026#39s 11-year marriage ends in 30 seconds after he admits adulteryThe theory is dubious - but blaming Jamal Khashoggi\u0026#39s death on a botched interrogation is a convenient way outBoko Haram kills Red Cross staff member in Nigeria after kidnapping three aid workersHate crime linked to religion doubled in three yearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000177899881_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"emmanuel macron finally announces reshuffle bid reverse plummeting","story":"Emmanuel Macron names loyal aide Christophe Castaner as the new interior ministerPresident Emmanuel Macron of France has appointed a high-profile loyalist as interior minister in a reshuffle intended to breathe new life into his cabinet after a string of gaffes and political setbacks.Christophe Castaner, 52, steps down as head of Mr Macron\u0027s party La Republique en Marche (Republic on the Move) to take up the post. The job had been vacated by Gérard Collomb who quit two weeks previously to run for mayor of the city of Lyon in a blow to the centrist French president.Four other government members were replaced in the reshuffle, including the culture and agriculture ministers, seen as weak links in the cabinet.The heavyweight finance and foreign affairs ministers retain their positions while Marlène Schiappa, the gender equality minister, and Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister, have been granted wider remits.Macron loyalist Christophe Castaner named France\u0026#39s new interior ministerThe reshuffle proved a conundrum for Mr Macron, who kept France in the dark for two weeks over his move. It came after a rocky start to the summer recess for the 40-year old leader, who saw his popularity slump after a scandal involving his Elysée security chief, Alexandre Benalla, and the resignation of his star environment minister, Nicolas Hulot - a former wildlife TV presenter. After driving through a string of reforms, growth figures have slowed and Mr Macron has come under fire for brash off-the-cuff comments that, polls suggest, have fuelled French impressions that he is “arrogant”.He has even come in for a drubbing from his wife Brigitte, according to Le Parisien, which cited Elysée sources as saying the presidential walls “shook” this summer over their noisy rows. The newspaper reported that she was so annoyed at his inability to fire his ex-security aide more promptly that she left Paris for their holiday home in Le Touquet to cool down.Brigitte Macron was reportedly furious with her husband at his handling of a summer scandal involving his ex-security chiefOne of the rare Macron lieutenants who is a confident performer in the media, Mr Castaner is a southerner who offers a provincial touch away from the Parisian political elite but he has little experience in security and policing. His number two will be the current head of France\u0027s domestic intelligence agency, Laurent Nunez.In an apparent bid to re-gild his environmental credentials, Mr Macron gave his new environment minister François de Rugy, more weight in the cabinet hierarchy, effectively making his ministry the government\u0027s number two.The president has promised to keep up the pace of reform with an upcoming overhaul of unemployment benefits and the pensions systems.But plunging domestic approval ratings are hampering his efforts to take a leading role in Europe, bolster the euro area and lead the charge against nationalist forces from Italy to Hungary.Please review our commenting policyTory MP broke election spending rules to kill off Nigel Farage\u0026#39s dream of entering Parliament, court toldPoland\u0026#39s ruling party pressures cinemas to stop showing blockbuster film about Catholic Church abuseSpeaker John Bercow under huge pressure to resign after Maria Miller and Sir Kevin Barron tell him to goNicole Kidman says being married to Tom Cruise protected her from sexual harassment in Hollywood Leftist French leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon broadcasts police search on party HQ liveTurkish police searching for missing journalist found fresh coats of paint in Saudi consulate, Erdogan revealsIreland accuses UK of \u0026#39backsliding\u0026#39 on Brexit promises Internment camps for Muslim Uighurs make their lives ‘colourful’, Chinese governor claimsThree dead after car towing caravan drives wrong way down M40The warring factions Theresa May must pacify in her parliamentary tightrope walk to a Brexit dealFacebook, Google and Twitter forced to remove 30 million illegal and offensive posts in just 3 monthsPeter Dinklage hints at Tyrion\u0026#39s final fate in Game of ThronesPaedophile accused of murdering two schoolgirls goes on trial 30 years after he was acquittedComment: Brexiteers can\u0026#39t replace Theresa May, but that doesn\u0026#39t mean they don\u0026#39t hold swayComment: It shouldn\u0026#39t be up to tech giants to police hate speech, but they must contribute to the costAnt McPartlin and wife\u0026#39s 11-year marriage ends in 30 seconds after he admits adulteryThe theory is dubious - but blaming Jamal Khashoggi\u0026#39s death on a botched interrogation is a convenient way outBoko Haram kills Red Cross staff member in Nigeria after kidnapping three aid workersHate crime linked to religion doubled in three yearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000177958170_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqx53fkgbhJaeZx5rRR1bqgPYI6Lyb4FmdTiGmduhnNGs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mike pompeo lands saudi arabia riyadh set blame rogue operatives","story":"The Saudi consulate in Istanbul behind Turkish police barriersTurkish investigators searching the Saudi Arabian consulate where journalist Jamal Khashoggi went missing have found fresh coats of paint, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said.Police and prosecutors on Monday inspected the consulate building in Istanbul for over eight hours and on Tuesday widened their search to include the Saudi consul’s residence, a short distance away.Surveillance footage shows vehicles moving between the consulate and the consul\u0027s home after Mr Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the consulate nearly two weeks ago. According to reports, the government has an audio recording which they have shared as evidence with Saudi Arabia and the US.“My hope is that we can reach conclusions that will give us a reasonable opinion as soon as possible, because the investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over,” Mr Erdogan told reporters in Ankara.A guard outside the consul-general\u0026#39s residence, a location now implicated in the searchAccording to reports on Monday night, Riyadh may be about to admit journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in its consulate in Istanbul in a botched interrogation.Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, landed in Saudi Arabia for urgent talks with King Salman on Tuesday, seeking answers about the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, amid US media reports the kingdom may be mulling an admission he died during a botched interrogation.Rogue killers could be to blame for the disappearance of Khashoggi, who has not been seen since he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 to sort out marriage paperwork, President Donald Trump said after a telephone conversation with the king.Mr Trump dispatched Mr Pompeo to Riyadh for what the State Department described as face to face meetings with the Saudi leadership.US media reported on Monday that the kingdom is considering an admission that Mr Khashoggi died after an interrogation that went wrongTurkish police on Monday searched the consulate for the first time since Khashoggi, a Saudi national and US resident who became increasingly critical of powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, went missing.Turkish officials have said they believe he was killed - a claim Saudi Arabia has denied - with the controversy dealing a huge blow to the kingdom\u0027s image and efforts by its youthful crown prince to showcase a reform drive.But US media reported on Monday that the kingdom is considering an admission that Mr Khashoggi, a contributor to the Washington Post newspaper, died after an interrogation that went wrong during an intended abduction.Until Monday, Riyadh had not allowed Turkish investigators to search the consulate - officially Saudi territory - with reports both sides were at odds over the conditions.The investigators, who arrived in a motorcade of six cars late Monday, left the premises in the early hours of Tuesday after an an eight-hour search, an AFP correspondent reported. They took samples with them, including soil from the consulate garden, that was loaded into vans, one official at the scene said. A Saudi delegation had entered the consulate one hour before the Turkish police arrived and appeared to still be inside as the search was conducted.Mr Trump dispatched Mr Pompeo to Riyadh for what the State Department described as \u0026#34face to face meetings with the Saudi leadership\u0026#34Trump\u0027s comments came after a telephone conversation with King Salman, father of the crown prince, the first such talks since the crisis erupted.Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened \u0027to our Saudi Arabian citizen\u0027, Mr Trump tweeted.Riyadh\u0027s most recent comments have focused on having no knowledge of any killing or denying any order to kill Khashoggi had been given.The denial was very, very strong, Mr Trump later told reporters at the White House. It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?But CNN cited two sources as saying the Saudis are preparing a report that his death resulted from a botched interrogation, while the Wall Street Journal said the kingdom was weighing up whether to say that rogue operatives killed Mr Khashoggi by mistake. After critical talks in Riyadh Tuesday, Pompeo was expected in Turkey on Wednesday to meet Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.Please review our commenting policyTory MP broke election spending rules to kill off Nigel Farage\u0026#39s dream of entering Parliament, court toldPoland\u0026#39s ruling party pressures cinemas to stop showing blockbuster film about Catholic Church abuseSpeaker John Bercow under huge pressure to resign after Maria Miller and Sir Kevin Barron tell him to goNicole Kidman says being married to Tom Cruise protected her from sexual harassment in Hollywood Leftist French leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon broadcasts police search on party HQ liveIreland accuses UK of \u0026#39backsliding\u0026#39 on Brexit promises Internment camps for Muslim Uighurs make their lives ‘colourful’, Chinese governor claimsThree dead after car towing caravan drives wrong way down M40The warring factions Theresa May must pacify in her parliamentary tightrope walk to a Brexit dealFacebook, Google and Twitter forced to remove 30 million illegal and offensive posts in just 3 monthsPeter Dinklage hints at Tyrion\u0026#39s final fate in Game of ThronesPaedophile accused of murdering two schoolgirls goes on trial 30 years after he was acquittedComment: Brexiteers can\u0026#39t replace Theresa May, but that doesn\u0026#39t mean they don\u0026#39t hold swayComment: It shouldn\u0026#39t be up to tech giants to police hate speech, but they must contribute to the costEmmanuel Macron finally announces reshuffle in bid to reverse plummeting political fortunesAnt McPartlin and wife\u0026#39s 11-year marriage ends in 30 seconds after he admits adulteryThe theory is dubious - but blaming Jamal Khashoggi\u0026#39s death on a botched interrogation is a convenient way outBoko Haram kills Red Cross staff member in Nigeria after kidnapping three aid workersHate crime linked to religion doubled in three yearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"need stop stressing things like parmo food supposed creative","story":"It’s Parmogeddan.

Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda all lost a portion of market share, while Morrisons held on to its 10.3 per cent stake. Aldi grew its share from 6.8 per cent to 7.6 per cent, with sales rising 15.1 per cent, while Lidl’s share increased to 5.6 per cent from 5.2 per cent, on 10 per cent sales growth. Co-op was the only other bricks and mortar retailer to grow market share over the quarter, increasing its portion from 6.2 per cent to 6.4 per cent. Sales went up at all supermarkets, as shoppers began buying seasonal foods again. Kantar reported that £51m was spent on whole chickens and £62m on roasting joints in September, while 8 per cent of households spent a total of £8m on mince pies last month. Aldi considers stockpiling food to cope with BrexitAldi UK sales pass £10bn as discounter plans to open 130 new storesTesco expected to launch new discount storesFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, comments: “Consumer spending often slows in early autumn, after the excesses of summer barbecues and before the festive season kicks off. \u0026nbsp“The arrival of colder weather and darker evenings has inspired consumers to embrace hearty comfort foods and stock up on Sunday roast staples.”Meanwhile, focusing on Tesco, Mr McKevitt noted that despite “widespread interest” in the launch of its discount brand\u0026nbspJack’s\u0026nbsplast month “the small number of stores planned means it won’t have an impact on Tesco’s market share without a significant expansion”. Tesco opened two Jack’s stores in September and announced plans for up to 15 more next year. The group put itself in direct competition with Aldi and Lidl as it said Jack’s would be “cheapest in town”, with a focus on British products.

Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda all lost a portion of market share, while Morrisons held on to its 10.3 per cent stake. Aldi grew its share from 6.8 per cent to 7.6 per cent, with sales rising 15.1 per cent, while Lidl’s share increased to 5.6 per cent from 5.2 per cent, on 10 per cent sales growth. Co-op was the only other bricks and mortar retailer to grow market share over the quarter, increasing its portion from 6.2 per cent to 6.4 per cent. Sales went up at all supermarkets, as shoppers began buying seasonal foods again. Kantar reported that £51m was spent on whole chickens and £62m on roasting joints in September, while 8 per cent of households spent a total of £8m on mince pies last month. Aldi considers stockpiling food to cope with BrexitAldi UK sales pass £10bn as discounter plans to open 130 new storesTesco expected to launch new discount storesFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, comments: “Consumer spending often slows in early autumn, after the excesses of summer barbecues and before the festive season kicks off. \u0026nbsp“The arrival of colder weather and darker evenings has inspired consumers to embrace hearty comfort foods and stock up on Sunday roast staples.”Meanwhile, focusing on Tesco, Mr McKevitt noted that despite “widespread interest” in the launch of its discount brand\u0026nbspJack’s\u0026nbsplast month “the small number of stores planned means it won’t have an impact on Tesco’s market share without a significant expansion”. Tesco opened two Jack’s stores in September and announced plans for up to 15 more next year. The group put itself in direct competition with Aldi and Lidl as it said Jack’s would be “cheapest in town”, with a focus on British products.

disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Billed as “Davos in the Desert”, the lavish Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit is meant to showcase Saudi Arabia’s modernising drive under Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.\u0026nbspBut the build-up has been calamitous for the de facto Saudi ruler as a string of big-name sponsors, speakers and partners have dropped out after Mr Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October and never re-emerged.Mike Pompeo visits Saudi Arabia to discuss Jamal Khashoggi caseJust days ago, the attendee\u0027s list read like a who’s

chief executive Larry Fink, Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi are among others to have already pulled out as international pressure mounted on the Saudi regime.Disappearance of

from a dependence on oil towards a more broad-based, high-tech economy.Alongside sweeping economic reforms, the Crown Prince, often referred to by his initials MBS, has been keen to trumpet a liberalisation of social values in the conservative kingdom.\u0026nbspBut the withdrawal of vast dozens of the world’s leading media outlets\u0026nbspand companies from the high-profile event suggests that his Saudi rebrand has already been badly, perhaps fatally, damaged by events in Istanbul.Allegations that senior Saudi officials ordered the murder of a journalist and prominent critic will, if proved correct, pile further pressure on firms to distance themselves from the country and its billions.Dozens of Turkish and Saudi officials entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Monday to begin a joint investigation into the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi.That came after claims that the Saudis may be ready to admit the dissident journalist was killed during an interrogation that went wrong.CNN cited an unnamed source as saying the Saudis would claim the operation was carried out “without clearance or transparency” and that those involved would be punished – although another source cautioned that Riyadh could change its version of events.Hours before the 60-year-old’s scheduled consular visit, 15 Saudis – some of whom were later identified as security officials – arrived in Istanbul, leaving the country shortly after he disappeared, according to information published by Turkish media close to the government.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

It sees the new residential let market as competitive, meaning that landlords have no\u0026nbsppower to pass on additional costs to tenants.“Despite scaremongering by the property industry, renters have little to fear from a housing market that is no longer a playground for speculators,” said Dan Wilson Craw of Generation Rent.“If homes leave the private rented sector then so do the private renters who are now able to become home owners. The balance of supply and demand is unchanged and so are rents.”The group also found no evidence of an increase in rent in the wake of a drop in loans for buy-to-let after tax changes in 2016.In recent years, amid a backlash against the growth of buy-to-let and discontent from private sector renters, the Government has adopted a range of measures to tilt the market in favour of first-time buyers.As well as the increase in stamp duty for buy-to-let investors, it has partially withdrawn their mortgage interest relief and restricted allowable tax deductions for wear-and-tear.At the time of the 2015 stamp duty hike, the mortgage lender Kent Reliance predicted it would lead to £55 a month increase in the rent charged on a £220,000 home.Earlier this year, Simon Rubinsohn of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: “While it is understandable that the government wanted to provide a lift for first time buyers, this may well come at the cost of higher rents as the appeal of buy to let diminishes.”According to the latest English Housing Survey 20 per cent of households now live in the private rented sector, up from 12 per cent in 2006-07.Data from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that bank loans for buy-to-let purchases shot up from 6 per cent of gross advances in 2009 to 22 per cent in 2016.More recently, research suggests that buy-to-let investors have been withdrawing from the property market, particularly in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.Other apps with messaging functionality, including Snapchat and Facebook-owned Instagram, already allow users to unsend\u0026nbspmessages on their platforms.A Facebook spokesperson was not immediately available for comment but the firm told TechCrunch that it is working on developing the feature.Facebook internally tests products and features before they ship to the public so we can ensure the quality of the experience, the spokesperson said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Both films managed to retain large audience numbers, taking $35.7m and\u0026nbsp$28m respectively.Venom has shrugged off widely negative reviews to take\u0026nbsp$142m over 10 days in the US, while A Star Is Born – a firm awards favourite – has taken\u0026nbsp$94m over the same duration of time.

Dir. the Safdie brothers, stars Robert Pattinson, Jennifer Jason Leigh)A Star is Born likely stole audiences attention away from First Man thanks to its\u0026nbsphigher profile cast (Gaga and\u0026nbspBradley Cooper compared to Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy) and ever-so-slightly better word-of-mouth, landing an “A” Cinemascore. There was also Chazelle’s\u0026nbspcontroversial decision to omit showing the American flag being planted into the moon, which caused a backlash from certain commentators, including\u0026nbspRepublican senator Marco Rubio.\u0026nbspThe controversy began after Gosling said, during a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, that he believed the astronaut’s moonwalk “was widely regarded not as an American, but as a human achievement”.\u0026nbspThe truth behind First Man’s most talked about scene“He was reminding everyone that he was just the tip of the iceberg—and that’s not just to be humble, that’s also true,” he said.\u0026nbsp”So I don’t think that Neil viewed himself as an American hero. From my interviews with his family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite. And we wanted the film to reflect Neil.”The statement has been widely discussed online, and\u0026nbspalthough the American flag does appear on the moon in the movie, the damage seems to have been done. A spokesperson for the studio behind the $70m-costing First Man, Universal, has\u0026nbspsaid the box office results are not disappointing and pointed out that well-reviewed awards films often have long legs in cinemas.\u0026nbsp“This weekend’s results are\u0026nbspjust a starting point,”\u0026nbspUniversal’s distribution president Jim Orr told Variety.\u0026nbsp”Quality adult dramas released in this time period produce very healthy multiples. This is very much a marathon, not a sprint.”\u0026nbspOther new releases over the weekend in the States include Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween and Bad Times at the El Royale, which made $16.2m\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp$7.2m, respectively. Next weekend looks to be another bumper box office bonanza as Halloween opens\u0026nbspanalysts are expecting the horror to make as much as $60m.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

big names have pulled out Google, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered have all pulled out of a technology and business conference in Saudi Arabia as pressure mounts on the Gulf kingdom to explain the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Billed as “Davos in the Desert”, the lavish Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit is meant to showcase Saudi Arabia’s modernising drive under Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.\u0026nbspBut the build-up has been calamitous for the de facto Saudi ruler as a string of big-name sponsors, speakers and partners have dropped out after Mr Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October and never re-emerged.Mike Pompeo visits Saudi Arabia to discuss Jamal Khashoggi caseJust days ago, the attendee\u0027s list read like a who’s who of the corporate, media and technology worlds but on Monday the boss of Google’s cloud services business, Diane Greene, became the latest name\u0026nbspto be crossed out.\u0026nbspWhen the curtain is pulled up next week\u0026nbspthe conference will\u0026nbsplikely\u0026nbspbe somewhat more sparsely populated than Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince would have hoped.There will be no John Flint from HSBC, nor Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse or Bill Winters of Standard Chartered all three all pulled out on Tuesday.JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon said on Monday he would no longer attend while BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi are among others to have already pulled out as international pressure mounted on the Saudi regime.Disappearance of Saudi journalist exposes Trump\u0027s lack of ambassadorsRichard Branson pulls out of $1bn Saudi talks over missing journalistTurkey says it has audio and video proof Jamal

demonstrate Riyadh’s move away from a dependence on oil towards a more broad-based, high-tech economy.Alongside sweeping economic reforms, the Crown Prince, often referred to by his initials MBS, has been keen to trumpet a liberalisation of social values in the conservative kingdom.\u0026nbspBut the withdrawal of vast dozens of the world’s leading media outlets\u0026nbspand companies from the high-profile event suggests that his Saudi rebrand has already been badly, perhaps fatally, damaged by events in Istanbul.Allegations that senior Saudi officials ordered the murder of a journalist and prominent critic will, if proved correct, pile further pressure on firms to distance themselves from the country and its billions.Dozens of Turkish and Saudi officials entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Monday to begin a joint investigation into the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi.That came after claims that the Saudis may be ready to admit the dissident journalist was killed during an interrogation that went wrong.CNN cited an unnamed source as saying the Saudis would claim the operation was carried out “without clearance or transparency” and that those involved would be punished – although another source cautioned that Riyadh could change its version of events.Hours before the 60-year-old’s scheduled consular visit, 15 Saudis – some of whom were later identified as security officials – arrived in Istanbul, leaving the country shortly after he disappeared, according to information published by Turkish media close to the government.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate

Huawei\u0027s timetable sees two main releases a year, with the bigger-screen Mate Series taking the autumn slot. So, what\u0027s new?Quite a lot actually, and while some manufacturers seem to offer incremental upgrades every six or 12 months, the Mate 20 Pro is stuffed to the gills with innovation, including a super-cool reverse wireless charging feature. But I\u0027m getting ahead of myself.The new phone is clearly related to the industrial design of the P20 Pro but has a significantly more elegant finish. Every corner and surface is gently curved, making for a phone that is far from small but still manages to fit the hand very comfortably.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

But to the flat of your finger it feels entirely smooth.Huawei says this should make the phone grippier and less prone to fingerprints and calls it a \u0027hyperoptical\u0027 pattern.The glass has been treated to have a shimmering, colour-changing effect depending on how you hold it. Most attractive of these is midnight blue which looks classy and businesslike without being dull. Emerald green has a similar shimmer and there\u0027s also pink gold and twilight black.The screen stretches almost to the bottom of the phone. It\u0027s not quite to the base but unlike the P20 Pro, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor at the base of the phone, which we\u0027ll come back to in a moment.There is a notch at the top of the display, with front-facing camera for facial recognition and, inevitably, for selfies.The rear of the phone is dominated by a three-camera set-up, like the P20 Pro. But, here, Huawei has placed the three cameras and flash in a square arrangement which is strikingly different from rivals. And the company has gone to a lot of trouble with the design here, too. The square in which the cameras sit is edged with four rounded corners which perfectly match the curved corners of the phone itself.The camera square is the only detail on the back of the phone, apart from the company name down towards the bottom. It means there\u0027s a spare, strong look to the design.And this phone is waterproof to a level of IP68, which means it can sit in 2 metres of water for half an hour safely.So, you\u0027ll have noticed there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor on the rear of the phone, nor at the base of the display. You can unlock the handset with facial recognition, which works reasonably quickly.But there\u0027s a much cooler way to do it.The Mate 20 Pro has a fingerprint sensor built right into the display, buried in the middle of the screen. When you lift the phone, the lock screen has a fingerprint icon which shows you where to press. Not only does it work well and very quickly, it\u0027s amazingly satisfying to use.Huawei has put this technology into a phone before, and rumours suggest other handsets will have it, and soon, but in any event, it\u0027s a great feature that could almost be enough to tempt you on its own.Which brings us to the coolest feature of all, and a genuine full-on innovation. This phone is capable of wireless charging, as many others are. A charging coil in the back of the phone receives the power from a wireless charging pad.But Huawei has somehow managed to create a phone which can give as well as take. If your phone is capable of wireless charging and you are running out of battery power, well, I can help. By pressing your phone against the back of mine, the Huawei charges your handset. A haptic buzz confirms the connection and it feels little short of magic.Because Qi wireless charging is an open standard, you\u0027re not restricted to other Huawei Mate 20s, when it comes to sharing your battery. I\u0027ve tested this against an iPhone XS Max and it works perfectly.Sure, it\u0027s not as fast as a plugged-in charger, but it\u0027s pretty amazing. It requires a flick of a setting to turn it on, and if you don\u0027t charge it, the feature switches off after three minutes.At best, this will lead to a future full of generous battery sharing and at worst, well, there must be a cheesy chat-up line or two to be had out of all this, no?The phone will charge fast through regular wireless charging, Huawei says, and very fast through a wired charge – the company says it will go from flat to 70 per cent in 30 minutes, an increase over the P20 Pro which would reach 58 per cent in the same time.The battery is big, by the way, clocking in at 4200mAh, so it should run a full day with ease.The Mate 20 Pro boasts a 7nm processor (nm means nanometre). This is quite an achievement. Apple has a 7nm processor in its latest phones but, Huawei points out, it was the first to announce it, even if the phone is coming to market a little later.The benefits of a 7nm processor? Well, it promises to be faster and more power-efficient.This was what set the P20 Pro apart from pretty much every other cameraphone. Leica\u0027s involvement was crucial to this. It included a sensor with a whopping 40MP resolution, a black-and-white sensor to grab detail quickly even in low light and a separate 8MP sensor which effectively offered 3x optical zoom.This time, the monochrome sensor has been replaced by an ultra-wide-angle 20MP colour one. Huawei says the sensors are now so fast, there\u0027s no need for the monochrome, though I suspect it means that if you want to shoot in black-and-white, you\u0027ll get images which are decent rather than, as before, outstanding. Mind you, black-and-white isn\u0027t a priority for most people.The 8MP sensor remains at a focal length which gives an effective 3x optical zoom and the Ultra-wide is a 20MP camera which is 0.6x the zoom of the wide-angle lens. This lens is also exceptional for close-up shots, Huawei says, allowing you to get as close as 2.5cm from your subject.All these make for a potentially very powerful camera, and that\u0027s before we\u0027ve talked about AI.Huawei Mate 10: An AI phone designed to think like a humanHuawei uses artificial intelligence heavily in its cameras, using scene settings to improve the photographic results. So, if it\u0027s a dog you’re photographing, it fluffs up Fido\u0027s fur, but if it\u0027s a cat, Tibbles\u0027 eyes will be enhanced.This use of AI should mean you can trust to the automatic settings of the camera and concentrate on capturing the moment and framing your shot.The front-facing camera is a 24MP model capable of wider selfies than some, so you can all squeeze in.There\u0027s a lot to like in the Mate 20 Pro, from the snazzy cameras to attention-grabbing features like the in-screen fingerprint sensor and the brilliant reverse wireless charging.Huawei\u0027s special version of Android software hasn\u0027t always met with positive reaction, though this version certainly looks better, and it remains to be seen how effective the AI turns out to be, beyond improving the photos, but there\u0027s no doubt this is an imaginative and innovative handset. The phone is out soon and costs £899.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Andrew Grice\u0026nbspasks whether the dominance of big tech is now imperilling our democratic system and considers what can be done about itClick to followThe IndependentAllegations of state-sponsored interference in foreign elections have changed the gameWhen Theresa May called a surprise election last year Labour rushed out a manifesto which proved remarkably popular. There was, however, a hole at its heart. Plans to renationalise the rail, water and parts of the energy industry had a backward-looking feel, and Labour had nothing to say about the new oligopolies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix.That is one reason why Jeremy Corbyn was keen to take on the digital giants in his speech to the Edinburgh Television Festival in August, proposing that the BBC receive a “digital licence fee” funded by a tax on tech companies or internet service providers. The Labour leader, who said his party faces “greater hostility from\u0026nbspthe mainstream media than we’ve probably ever had before”, inevitably faced media criticism for some of his ideas – not least in respect of a proposed expansion of\u0026nbsp“public service journalism”, funded by tech firms, which sceptics doubted would be free from political interference.But Corbyn’s proposals on the tech multinationals were well timed and reflect a changing public and political mood. In July, Facebook was fined the maximum £500,000 by the UK Information Commissioner after its data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile, Vote Leave was fined £61,000 and referred to the police after the Electoral Commission ruled that it exceeded its £7m spending limit by channelling £675,000 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. It must be added that it denies the claim.I’m leaving Facebook – and it’s not because of Cambridge AnalyticaIn the same month, the cross-party Digital,\u0026nbspCulture, Media and Sport Select Committee produced a devastating critique of the new media landscape. Damian Collins, its Tory chair, warned that democracy itself is at risk. The committee proposed that social media sites be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors and recommended a “clear legal liability” for tech companies which failed to act against harmful and illegal content.For the past 36 years, I’ve had a ringside seat at the often bruising battles between politicians and the media\u0026nbspthe last 20 of them while working for The Independent. When I became a Westminster-based journalist in 1982, the remnants of a much more deferential age were still evident. The questions we asked were a little more probing than the “is there anything you’d like to say today, prime minister?” style of interrogation that was evident in the 1950s, when television news was launched. But the male-dominated club of parliamentary lobby journalists I joined was unnecessarily secretive. “Maintain the mystique,” one veteran political editor told me.It was an open secret that the Downing Street press secretary – then Bernard Ingham for Margaret Thatcher – briefed the lobby daily. But we were not allowed to quote Number 10 such briefings had to be attributed to “Whitehall sources”. The archaic system would eventually change, with The Independent among those championing reform after its launch in 1986.The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always thereThe lobby has many critics. Yet if it was scrapped today, it would re-emerge in a different guise tomorrow politicians and the media need each other, and they need to talk, however strained the relationship. The lobby is not perfect, and still too dominated by men. But some criticism is overdone. Conspiracy theorists on the left recently claimed the existence of a Press Gallery WhatsApp group showed how the lobby pack agrees the line to take on stories. At the time, the group was discussing smelly towels left in the showers and the price of crisps in our canteen.Much is also made of anonymous briefings by politicians and their advisers. But if these were abolished and all statements were on the record, many would be so bland as to be worthless. It is the journalist’s job to find out what’s going on people are more willing to talk without having their names attached to a quote: such discussions will always take place. Jeremy Corbyn’s team often relies on such briefings. Do spin doctors abuse this system and lie? Occasionally, but less than you might think journalists have long memories and won’t believe them next time if they get caught.The inevitable “poacher versus gamekeeper” relationship between media and politicians has changed markedly during my time at Westminster – and it’s changed for the worse, with both sides being to blame. The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always there. When I joined the lobby, old hands told me: “Right-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to the Conservative Party. And left-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to… the Conservative Party as well!”What’s shifted is that some national newspapers have crossed a line, becoming players on the political stage rather than impartial analysts. The iding line between news and comment has become blurred, and in some cases invisible. It was as if the papers, hit by declining circulations – which fell from a combined 14.8 million in 1983 to 5.9 million last year – decided to shout louder to grab people’s attention. The launch from 1989 of the 24-hour television news channels – first Sky, then a BBC offering – meant the papers were no longer first with the news, and sometimes became more focused on infotainment than information.The growing influence of TV and the decline of newspapers was made clear when the UK belatedly held its first televised election debates between party leaders at the 2010 general election. The debates dominated press coverage as soon as one debate ended, the papers previewed the next. Nevertheless, the political spin doctors continue to fret 247 about what the papers say, because they often still set the broadcasters’ agenda.Some elements of the press, particularly on the right, have given news an opinionated twist, and has become less reliable as a result. There’s no doubt that hostile, often inaccurate, coverage of the European Union – and underreporting about the benefits of membership – played a critical role in the decision to hold the 2016 referendum and in the result.By then (if not before), some papers had crossed a line between healthy scepticism about politics and its practitioners to unhealthy cynicism. In 2009, The Daily  was absolutely right to expose abuses of the MPs’ expenses system but there has been a feeding frenzy ever since: a misleading presumption that MPs are in it for themselves. In my view, this has gone too far, fuelling in turn public cynicism and a lack of trust in politicians – though it’s also true to say they contributed to this by trying to spin their way out of troubles they had made themselves.At the 1992 election, Neil Kinnock, a modernising Labour leader, faced a barrage of highly personal abuse and criticism in the Tory tabloids. The Sun’s front page on polling day declared that if Kinnock won, “will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?” The Sun claimed to have “won it” when the Conservatives were re-elected but the truth was that Rupert Murdoch liked to back the winner (and be seen to have done so) to maximise his influence.Scarred by Kinnock’s treatment, Tony Blair made a sea change when he became Labour leader two years later. He told me: “I’m not going to let them do to me what they did to Neil. Never again.” In Blair’s view, that meant supping with the devil. He flew halfway round the world to address a conference held by Murdoch in Australia. Blair once said: “It is better to ride the back of a tiger than let it rip your throat out.”The cosying up was accompanied by a much more aggressive response to negative media reports about Labour – there would be a “rapid rebuttal” or even “pre-buttal” when the party got wind of a potentially damaging story. New Labour spin doctors put pressure on journalists, with threats such as “you’ll never get another interview or exclusive if you write this” they complained behind reporters’ backs to their editor, occasionally even demanding their removal.\u0026nbspThey doled out exclusive stories to favoured journalists or papers, though there was nothing new in that.Blair’s “hug them close” strategy worked, at least in opposition. The Sun, the country’s biggest selling paper, came out for Labour at the 1997 election (which it was bound to win in any event). In government though, New Labour became too eager to please its media enemies-turned-friends. Lance Price, who was deputy to Alastair Campbell, Blair’s communications director, said “no major decision could be taken by the government without first assessing the reaction of three people”:\u0026nbspGordon Brown, the chancellor John Prescott, the deputy prime minister and Murdoch.Spin had its limitations of course. Headline-grabbing works in opposition, when the media is your main weapon but in power, New Labour discovered that headlines were no substitute for policy or action. Spin would also, in the end, contribute to Blair’s demise and help to tarnish his legacy. In 2003, he discovered that you cannot spin the case for war, when it is based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.As papers like The Sun tired of Blair and reverted to type, he launched an attack on the “feral beasts” of the media in one of his last speeches as prime minister. I sat in the front row, appalled that he bizarrely singled out The Independent for criticism when his real target was the Daily Mail he was still too frightened of its power to say so.David Cameron copied the New Labour playbook when he began modernising the Conservatives on becoming their leader in 2005. Mirroring Blair’s trip to Australia, Cameron flew to the Google Zeitgeist conference in San Francisco in 2007, symbolically paying homage to the new power in the media world.\u0026nbspCameron, who called Blair “the master”, faithfully adopted his top-down, centralised approach to media management, and imported it into government in 2010. The cosy relationship between leading figures in the government and media was highlighted again during the Leveson inquiry after the phone-hacking scandal.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known...When Theresa May succeeded Cameron after his ill-fated EU referendum in 2016 she set out to do everything differently. That included moving away from a rigid day-to-day “grid” of centrally controlled initiatives designed to allow the government to set the agenda. May tried to curb headline-grabbing stunts, and focus on fewer, bigger statements. It was an honest attempt to combat spin, but didn’t work in a digital age when the battle between government and media (and between parties, and even between factions within parties) had become ever faster and more frenetic. However, it is doubtful whether any administration could dictate the agenda while Brexit eclipses everything.May’s disastrous snap election last year would prove a watershed for the press. Right-wing papers reprised their 1992 treatment of Kinnock to target Corbyn, but this time – refreshingly – it didn’t work. In the age of the insurgent, already exploited by Trump and the Brexiteers, social media helped Corbyn bypass the mainstream media (the hated “MSM” in Corbynland). Friends sharing pro-Labour stories on Facebook and other social platforms proved a powerful weapon. Labour’s machine outgunned the Tories, diluting the impact of the right-leaning press.However, it remains to be seen whether the old media has really been replaced by new media which, despite the early optimism about “digital democracy” during Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, seems actually to undermine rather than enhance democracy. In those days of hope, I didn’t imagine Trump tweeting from the White House at 5am about the “fake news media” and journalists who are “the enemy of the people”.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known – no coincidence when filter bubbles create echo chambers that reinforce our own views. The abuse hurled around on Twitter, between fellow party members as well as opponents, is nasty, often misogynistic and sometimes racist. It scars our politics.At the 2017 election, parties spent more than 40 per cent of their advertising budgets online. During the EU referendum, Vote Leave devoted 98 per cent of its ad spend to digital, much on highly targeted “dark” ads which no one but the recipients could see. It ran a last-minute blitz claiming falsely: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Our schools and hospitals already can’t cope!”The social media ads used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever inventedThe tech giants have been slow to put their house in order, and politicians slow to force them. While claiming to be platforms rather than publishers, they have often paid little tax in countries where they made vast profits. They have demolished the economic model of newspapers by gobbling up much of their advertising revenue. Some 300 local papers have closed in the UK in the past 10 years, undermining democracy at local levePoliticians want to sound modern and offer a vision of the future. But Tom Baldwin, a former political journalist who was Ed Miliband’s communications director, believes they do not understand the new technology and are afraid to regulate the new giants roaming the media landscape. In a revealing and thoughtful new book covering politics on both sides of the Atlantic, Ctrl Alt Delete, published by Hurst, Baldwin argues that the new information age “has unpicked truth and hollowed out space for a virulent new strain of populism to spread like a contagion across all forms of media”. He says: “The social media ads that were used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented.”What, then, needs to be done? The government plans to require an imprint showing the identity of those running digital ads, and a new offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners. But it will need to go much further to ensure a system of\u0026nbspelectoral law brought in for an analogue era is fit for a fast-evolving digital age.Created with Sketch.11 useful Facebook features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Clean up your News FeedMost of us are Facebook friends with some people we don’t actually care about, and there are several ways to keep their updates off your News Feed.

They could be funded by a levy on the tech giants. There should be a statutory code of practice covering the use of personal data by political campaigns. All political ads should be published in some sort of central register so that everyone can see them. In election periods, ads should be limited to registered campaigns, following evidence of Russian interference in the last US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.There is rising political support for a ban on online political ads, to bring the internet into line with broadcast media. It extends from Baldwin on the left to William Hague, the former Tory leader, on the right. This would help to stop those with the deepest pockets enjoying an unfair advantage, but would not prevent videos being shared.For a government consumed by Brexit, such reforms might not look like a priority. But with growing evidence that our democracy is under threat, the task is urgent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You may have seen a black laptop before, he says, with a disconcerting sincerity, but you\u0027ve never seen a black laptop like this before.Lifting the lid of the computer, he invites\u0026nbspme to touch it. Go ahead, he says. Stroke it. I do as I\u0027m\u0026nbsptold and run my fingers along the soft\u0026nbspsurface of the palm rest. That\u0027s Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth, he continues. Usually you\u0027d find it in luxury cars. It\u0027s absolutely stunning.Sure enough, it feels\u0026nbspmore suited to being something you\u0027d sit on than cover an electronic device\u0026nbspwith, and even the smell is more like a new car than a laptop. Researching it later I learnt Alcantara\u0026nbsphas been used in everything from Formula 1 race cars to space ships, and the fact Microsoft has decided to use it in its latest laptop is a supremely smooth statement of intent in a high-end hardware category typically dominated by Apple.Alcantara material on the palm rests is designed for \u0027maximised typing comfort\u0027 (The Independent)The man from Microsoft - Simon Lambert, devices category lead for Surface - takes 10 minutes just to talk me through the design decisions that went into creating the Surface Laptop 2. For starters, there are no visible screw on its exterior and no bumpers on the edge of the screen to protect it when you close it. (Why would you need them when you\u0027ve got Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth to cushion it?)For a high-performance laptop with an impressive 14.5-hour battery life, it is also absurdly thin. I\u0026nbspuse the smallest flagship smartphone on the market - the Sony Xperia\u0026nbspXZ1 - and at its thinnest point the Surface Laptop 2 is the same width: less than 1 cm thick. As it thickens out towards the base of the screen, it adds less than half a centimetre. Yet despite the slim\u0026nbspprofile, it feels incredibly sturdy and is able to offer a typing experience rarely found in the so-called Ultrabook category of laptops.The most obvious comparison in terms of size and design would be the now-ancient MacBook Air, but in terms of internal specs it would be more appropriate to put it up against this year\u0027s 13-inch MacBook Pro. It features the same 8GB\u0026nbspor 16GB\u0026nbspof RAM, together with an 8th-generation\u0026nbspIntel Core i5 or i7 -\u0026nbspdepending on the version you choose.Beyond specs, Microsoft is also able to put itself alongside both Apple and Google in combining their own hardware with their own software, meaning\u0026nbspthe Laptop 2 is built with Windows 10 in mind.The Surface Laptop 2 comes less than a year and a half after Microsoft unveiled the first Surface Laptop, which the Redmond-based firm described at the time as 50 per cent faster than the MacBook Pro. This time, Lambert tells me the Surface Laptop 2 is 85 per cent faster than its predecessor.Lambert explains that the attention to detail goes right down to the travel of the keys on the keyboard, which punch down 1.5mm - a full 1 mm more than the 13-inch MacBook Pro. For someone who types words for a living, this kind of thought is appreciated. With the Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth cushioning the heels of my hands, and the thick clunk of the keys making each letter from my fingertips feel purposeful, even writing these words for this review feels\u0026nbspgood.Backlit keys also help to improve the typing experience, but it is not just light that emanates\u0026nbspfrom the keyboard.\u0026nbspThe OmniSonic speakers mean sound plays straight out from between the keys, offering both a rich and loud sound that once again belies the delicate size of the Surface Laptop 2.The generous size of the palm rests means that there has inevitably been a compromise with the size of the trackpad. Moving the mouse around the screen felt cumbersome and took some getting used to - a burden that is addressed to some extent by the inclusion of a touchscreen. This proves particularly useful when flicking through Netflix or scrolling down webpages.If you\u0027re looking for further downsides, the other obvious one is the lack of ports. Beyond holes for a power cable\u0026nbspand a single USB drive, there is only a Mini Display Port, meaning anything else like an HDMI cable will require a dongle - proving that Microsoft is able to borrow both the bad and the good from Apple.But overall, the Surface Laptop 2 is a powerful combination of performance, design and battery life, that is able to fulfil even the most fawning of plaudits gushed by Lambert. With the best hardware combined with the best software, he tells me, with genuine adulation,\u0026nbspthis black laptop is the only black laptop that will let you do more, achieve more, and dream more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It sees the new residential let market as competitive, meaning that landlords have no\u0026nbsppower to pass on additional costs to tenants.“Despite scaremongering by the property industry, renters have little to fear from a housing market that is no longer a playground for speculators,” said Dan Wilson Craw of Generation Rent.“If homes leave the private rented sector then so do the private renters who are now able to become home owners. The balance of supply and demand is unchanged and so are rents.”The group also found no evidence of an increase in rent in the wake of a drop in loans for buy-to-let after tax changes in 2016.In recent years, amid a backlash against the growth of buy-to-let and discontent from private sector renters, the Government has adopted a range of measures to tilt the market in favour of first-time buyers.As well as the increase in stamp duty for buy-to-let investors, it has partially withdrawn their mortgage interest relief and restricted allowable tax deductions for wear-and-tear.At the time of the 2015 stamp duty hike, the mortgage lender Kent Reliance predicted it would lead to £55 a month increase in the rent charged on a £220,000 home.Earlier this year, Simon Rubinsohn of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: “While it is understandable that the government wanted to provide a lift for first time buyers, this may well come at the cost of higher rents as the appeal of buy to let diminishes.”According to the latest English Housing Survey 20 per cent of households now live in the private rented sector, up from 12 per cent in 2006-07.Data from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that bank loans for buy-to-let purchases shot up from 6 per cent of gross advances in 2009 to 22 per cent in 2016.More recently, research suggests that buy-to-let investors have been withdrawing from the property market, particularly in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is a bright flash of radioactive\u0026nbspthat flings out huge quantities of important elements like silver, gold, platinum and uranium.The announcement comes after scientists announced last October that they had seen the first explosion of this kind. They spotted super dense stars smashing into each other 130 million light years away\u0026nbsp– wobbling the spacetime of the universe, and allowing them to be picked up by gravitational wave detectors at LIGO.At the time, that discovery was hailed as a new chapter in astrophysics and an unexpected discovery. It allowed scientists to understand the spectacular explosions of neutron stars, as well as answering questions about where gold comes from.Now, scientists have found what they think might be a related event, known as\u0026nbspGRB150101B – and one that suggests such spectacular explosions could be far more common than we had realised. The similarities between the two events have led researchers to suggest they might in fact be related.It\u0027s a big step to go from one detected object to two, said study lead author Eleonora Troja, a researcher at the University of Maryland and\u0026nbspNASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center. Our discovery tells us that events like GW170817 and GRB150101B could represent a whole new class of erupting objects that turn on and off – and might actually be relatively common.The two look very similar: both threw out a short gamma-ray burst and a flash of bright, blue optical light. They also seem to come from very similar galaxies. Together, that has led scientists to believe that they are related – and that therefore many more similar events might be happening throughout the universe.We have a case of cosmic lookalikes, said study co-author Geoffrey Ryan, a postdoctoral researcher in the UMD Department of Astronomy and a fellow of the Joint Space-Science Institute. They look the same, act the same and come from similar neighbourhoods, so the simplest explanation is that they are from the same family of objects.Scientists are able to learn less about the new collision\u0026nbspbecause, unlike in October, they did not pick up the gravitational wave that was thrown out by the explosion because the new one was so much further away. With that data, it is possible to work out the masses of the two objects that merged\u0026nbsp– but they hope to gather that kind of data\u0026nbspin the future.Surely it\u0027s only a matter of time before another event like GW170817 will provide both gravitational wave data and electromagnetic imagery. If the next such observation reveals a merger between a neutron star and a black hole, that would be truly groundbreaking, said study co-author Alexander Kutyrev, an associate research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy with a joint appointment at NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center. Our latest observations give us renewed hope that we\u0027ll see such an event before too long.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She says Bradshaw is not taking part in this in the spirit it is intended and accuses him of\u0026nbspcasting aspersions on the deputy speakers\u0026nbspwho also stand up for backbenchers,\u0026nbspstand up for what\u0027s right for our country and are perfectly good\u0026nbspat taking the chair.\u0026nbspShe adds:\u0026nbspI don\u0027t understand why he feels that the future of this great nation relies on one inidual person, which is what he seems to be suggesting.Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas hits out at MPs criticising John Bercow, saying it is\u0026nbspnot the time for members to indulge in a bit of bullying of their own - there should be independent processes, not innuendos.\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s Jess Phillips launches a furious attack on James Duddridge over his earlier criticism of Bercow. She suggests the Tory backbencher is neither right nor honourable and has probably not spoken to any victims of bullying or harassment.\u0026nbspSaying she is totally and utterly maddened, Phillips adds: Some of us don\u0027t actually care who is the offender. It is the victims that we care about, and we will not use it for political gain.\u0026nbspShe says nothing fills\u0026nbspthe victims with more dread than when people play with their feelings, so don\u0027t do it.\u0026nbspShe says the leadership of the Commons needs massive overhaul but adds: Nothing I have heard today fills me with any hope that politics will\u0026nbspbe taken out of this.Other Tory MPs have also criticised John Bercow as the Commons discusss\u0026nbspbullying and harassment in Parliament.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJames Duddridge reads out a list of allegations contained in the Cox Report\u0026nbspand adds: How can we encourage Mr\u0026nbspSpeaker to\u0026nbspstop this behaviour?\u0026nbspAnne Main\u0026nbspsays the fish rots from the head and, in a clear swipe at Bercow, says: No one should be involved in this process that has been potentially linked to being part of the problem in this process.John Bercow has given his own response to the Cox Report into bullying and harassment in Parliament.\u0026nbspHe tells the Commons\u0026nbsphe is persuaded of the need for a body that is both entirely independent of\u0026nbspand external\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspParliament to hear and adjudicate upon all allegations of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct.\u0026nbspHe says independence and transparency are the best guarantors of a process that will both be fair and command confidence.\u0026nbspMPs are now hearing an urgent question from Labour MP John Mann on the subject of bullying and harassment in Parliament.\u0026nbspResponding, Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, says everyone has been\u0026nbspshocked and appalled by the reports of abuse in Parliament.\u0026nbspShe says the findings of the Cox Report are\u0026nbspundeniably worrying and reflect poorly on the systems in the House of Commons.\u0026nbspShe tells victims: You deserve so much better.\u0026nbspBut she says culture change will not happen overnight.Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, has said he hopes\u0026nbspa deal is possible in the coming weeks.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe have done a lot of work in the past weeks and the last few days with the British authorities to achieve a global agreement on the objective of an orderly withdrawal of the UK.This withdrawal must be orderly for everyone and in all subjects - including Ireland. We must find a solution to ensure that there is no hard border in any circumstance on the island of Ireland.We are not there yet. Several subjects remain open, including Ireland. We need more time to find this global agreement and achieve the decisive progress we need to finalise this negotiation on the orderly withdrawal.We will take this time, calmly and seriously, to find this global agreement in the next weeks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNEW: Theresa May told her Cabinet this morning that they must stand together if they are to secure a Brexit deal.\u0026nbspAccording to her spokesman, the prime minister said:\u0026nbspI\u0027m convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand\u0026nbspfirm, we can achieve this.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe spokesman said there was unity in support of Ms May\u0027s view that the UK should not be kept in the customs union indefinitely, but that the meeting was not a decision-making one.Germany has told Theresa May to take responsibility for Brexit.\u0026nbspThe country\u0027s foreign minister, Michael Roth, spoke as he arrived at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe said his message for Ms May was: Take responsibility and be constructive.\u0026nbspCabinet has now been going on for more than two and a half hours... Is Theresa May finding it harder than expected to convince her ministers to back her Brexit plan?What is the row over the customs backstop?\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0027s hopes of securing a Brexit deal hinge on reaching an agreement with the EU over plans for a customs backstop. But what is it, and why is it so contentious?\u0026nbspThe backstop spells out what should happen if the UK and EU cannot, at a future date, agree a trade deal that would lead to the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland being maintained.\u0026nbspUnder the prime\u0026nbspminister\u0027s proposal, in such a scenario the UK would agree to stay in a customs union with the EU until an alternative could be put in place. May insists this arrangement would be temporary. However, Brexiteers fear it would lead to the UK staying in the customs union indefinitely, and so they are demanding the back-stop has a specific time limit on it - something the EU is refusing\u0026nbspto agree to.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe EU also believes an agreement on the whole UK staying in the customs union temporarily is too complex to be signed off in the next few weeks. It therefore wants its original proposal to also be part of the deal - in effect, as a backstop to the backstop (still following?). Under this plan, only Northern Ireland would remain in a customs union with the EU, while the rest of the UK would not. May says any suggestion of Northern Ireland having different customs rules to the rest of the country after Brexit is completely unacceptable - and that\u0027s where the sticking point lies.\u0026nbspHer job today is to convince her Cabinet to accept her proposal for a UK-wide backstop that is temporary but not necessarily time-limited. Her task for tomorrow - which is likely to prove much more difficult - is to persuade EU leaders to ditch their demands for a fall-back that would keep only\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland in the customs union..Maria Miller, the former culture minister who now chairs the Commons\u0027 women and equalities committee, has led calls for John Bercow to step down.\u0026nbspShe told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today\u0026nbspprogramme:\u0026nbspWe have outstanding allegations directly against the Speaker, who will be one of the people who will be considering this report, and it cannot be right that the very people who are being criticised so heavily in an independent report are those who are going to be deciding how it is taken forward.\u0026nbspAsked if this meant Mr Bercow should resign, she said: Absolutely.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Often involves reducing or eliminating import taxes or quotas, and recognising or following each-others’ regulations so companies can sell into other countries’ markets without bureaucracy.A free trade area in which all countries abolish tariffs between each other and charge the same tariffs to goods coming from outside the customs union. The EU has one. Countries in the bloc collectively do trade deals with other countries outside the bloc, because they all follow the same conditions. Labour wants to be in one with the EU after Brexit.Free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour between all the countries in the EU the so-called “four freedoms”. Not a specific thing or organisation, but rather the result of all EU agreements and countries following the same rules. A work in progress, but the most comprehensive trade agreement between sovereign countries on earth so far.A free trade agreement like the one Canada has with the EU, but better (hence +++). Goods traded between the UK and EU have to be checked at the border but there wouldn’t be any import taxes. Brexiteers want it because it takes the UK out of the EU’s orbit compared to now EU says it’s the only sort of deal possible within the Prime Minister’s red-lines.Theresa May’s proposals for trade with the EU after Britain leaves, named after her official country residence where she locked her Cabinet in until they agreed to them. Rejected by the EU, and disliked by Tory eurosceptics.Part of Theresa May’s Chequers plan to keep bits of the single market it likes: the UK would follow EU rules for most goods that cross border. UK hopes this would mean no border checks would be needed, in combination with another deal on customs. EU says this is cherry-picking.Another part of Theresa May’s Chequers plan: an attempt by the UK to eliminate customs checks between Britain and the EU without having to be in a customs union. UK would collect EU customs taxes for it and then forward them on. EU says it could never agree to delegating its customs responsibilities to a country that isn’t in the EU.A relationship with the EU like the one Norway has – close, but not inside it. UK would follow most EU rules but get better trade access to single market. Achieved through membership of the European Economic Area – a non-EU agreement.A 21-month period that would start on 29 March 2019, the date Britain is set to leave the EU. During this period, the UK would continue to follow all EU rules and free movement would continue asked for by Theresa May to give the UK more time to prepare.A summit held in the Austrian city of Salzburg in September. EU leaders rejected Theresa May’s Chequers plan and laid down the law, widely regarded as a humiliation for the Prime Minister.A legal mechanism from the EU’s founding treaty that member states use to leave the EU. A two-year period begins the day it is triggered in which the country can negotiate an exit. Britain’s is due to expire on 29 March 2019. Can be extended with consent of all EU member states. It’s legally unclear whether it can be revoked by Britain or not and the European Court of Justice will rule on this aspect in late November.People’s Vote or Final SayA call for a referendum on the final deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels, or a second referendum giving the option of staying in – depending on who you ask.The Prime Minister’s original Brexit speech, where she laid down her red lines about wanting to leave the single market, customs union, and end freedom of movement.Negotiating principles the Prime Minister has laid down and said she will not cross: she wants to leave the single market, leave the customs union, end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and end free movement. Others have their own red lines: the Northern Irish DUP\u0026nbspsay they won\u0027t accept checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU says the UK can\u0027t cherry-pick the things it likes about the EU and keep them.Hard border and Soft borderA soft border, relating to Northern Ireland, is what currently exists\u0026nbsp – there are no real border checks or often even a sign that you’re crossing between the UK and the Republic. A hard border would see the introduction of checks and might happen because of Brexit. A soft border is required by the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles.\u0026nbspA legal mechanism to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit, no matter what happens elsewhere. Insisted upon in order to preserve the peace process. Both sides are trying to negotiate one that they are both happy with, but it’s a major sticking point in talks.A legally-binding deal the UK and EU want to sign before the UK leaves. Covers areas such as what happens to citizens living in other countries, who pays who what, and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Does not include a trade deal, which is dealt with by…A second agreement the UK and EU want to sign before Britain leaves next year. This agreement is not legally binding, but a political statement of intent by the two parties about what the two countries’ future relationship will look like – e.g. will it be Norway, Canada, Chequers… whatever. The actual future relationship will be negotiated after Britain leaves, probably during the transition period. Includes both trade and aspects on other areas like security cooperation.What the EU calls British attempts to keep the bits of the single market it likes and ditch the bits it doesn’t like. Also called ‘cake’, or “having your cake and eat it”, after something Boris Johnson once said. Not allowed by the EU, which says it would ruin the integrity of the single market.World Trade Organisation rules. The default rules of world trade for countries that are part of the WTO (164 are). What Britain will likely be trading with the EU on if there is no-deal. Not very flexible rules that would require customs checks and tariffs between Britain and the EU, which would be highly disruptive.

For Brexit they meet as 27 without Theresa May.

Or February? – House of Commons vote on dealAFPGetty)We don’t know when the House of Commons will get to vote on the final deal, but if one is struck, then it will – probably sometime in December, January, or February. This vote could be difficult for the Prime Minister as she could face rebellions by the DUP and Tory MPs.This is the very last cut-off date for a deal to be presented to Parliament under UK law. If no withdrawal agreement is presented to MPs by 21 January, they will get a vote on what should happen next. A second referendum? A bid for an extension? This all happens here.December? Or January? Or February? Or March? – European Parliament vote on the dealThe European Parliament will get a vote on the Brexit deal, too. The last date they can physically do so is during its sitting from 11-14 March, though it could happen before if an agreement is finalised earlier.The last European Council meeting that Britain will attend. Since it will be literally a week before the UK leaves it will probably be mostly a goodbye, as there won’t be much time to do anything.Barring an extension, Britain will officially leave the European Union two years after Theresa May triggered Article 50 of the EU’s treaty and set the country rolling towards the exit door.31 December 2020 – End of the transition periodTheresa May has negotiated a 21-month Brexit transition period under which the UK will continue to follow EU rules as if nothing has change.

The government must stop the rollout of universal credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about what\u0027s going on and what action the government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.Dame Louise Casey, a former senior government adviser, also told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that universal credit should be halted and sorted out to prevent thousands of families falling into crippling debt.My worry about more pauses is this needs to be halted and sorted out. Something also needs to be done for the thousands of people who have already transferred over to it who are now in crippling debt, she said.People having to wait for five weeks, who are used to being on either weekly or fortnightly pay, just doesn\u0027t add up, and making those people take out loans just pushes them further and further into destitution.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

This is to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptions as we go.”“We will publish full plans for the next stage of universal credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.”On Monday, in the Commons, Ms McVey was told by Frank Field, the independent MP and chairman of the work and pensions select committee in Westminster, that some women had resorted to prostitution in his Birkenhead constituency after being placed on the new welfare system.He told MPs: Might I raise a question that I wrote to the Secretary of State about, about how Universal Credit is being rolled out in Birkenhead, how it is not going as well as we\u0027re told in the House of Commons, and some women have taken to the red light district for the first time?Might she come to Birkenhead and meet those women\u0027s organisations and the police who are worried about women\u0027s security being pushed into this position?Ms McVey replied: We need to work with those ladies and see what help we can give them - from work coaches right the way through to various charities and organisations.In the meantime, I might add perhaps he could tell these ladies - and the work coaches can - that now we\u0027ve got record job vacancies, 830,000 job vacancies, and perhaps there are other jobs on offer.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Babies are exciting,” his friend said, who noted her family is in the UK and welcomed the news as well.“I hope they name it Di!” after the late Princess Diana the gentleman noted, adding “that would be sweet”. If it is a boy, both agreed any name would be lovely but “not Charles”. One woman said Americans fascination has to do with “the American and the British coming together and now they’re having a baby, it’s a big deal”. She said she thinks it will be a girl, but her friend said she hoped it would be a little boy. “A classic name, something like Catherine,” is what she wanted for a girl, but the other woman thought a baby boy will be named “Harry Jr” after his father. Several others out and about on a rainy morning were a bit ambivalent about the news, but one woman\u0026nbspcarting around her own toddler\u0026nbspsaid she thinks interest will peak when the duchess begins to debut her pregnancy fashion choices. The announcement was made public as the couple touched down in Australia on their second international tour, including Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand, after being married in April.A couple from Australia in New York on holiday were split in their reaction. The woman wished the royal couple congratulations and said she did not think it would happen so soon after the wedding, but her husband said he did not really care about the news, but did weigh in with a gender guess.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.In pictures: The wait for the royal baby begins Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of broadcast media give live reports across St. Mary\u0027s Hospital exclusive Lindo Wing in LondonRoyal supporter Terry Hutt poses for a picture outside The Lindo Wing of Saint Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington, west London.

While the AfD haven’t gone away, Sunday’s Bavarian elections show that the story is more complicated.The main way conservatives across Europe have reacted to the rise of right-wing populism has been to steal its clothes. If this is what voters want, then they can have it, the centre right has said. And they can get it from us.Britain is the best successful example of this strategy, where Theresa May’s Tories have eaten Ukip by embracing Brexit, lambasting “citizens of nowhere” and swelling their poll share to one they have not enjoyed for decades.Brexit talks: What on earth just happened?But Bavaria is now the best example of where this approach has gone wrong. For months before the election the CSU, the regional conservative allies of Angela Merkel who have dominated politics in the state since 1949, banged on about immigration. They faced down the chancellor and forced changes in refugee policy at a national level. The goal was to show voters there was no need to vote AfD if they wanted to be mean to foreigners.When polling day came on Sunday, the CSU lost a good chunk of voters to the AfD, as expected. But it lost more, according to a polling analysis by Der Spiegel, to the Greens – swathes of its one-time supporters apparently horrified at the party’s increasingly xenophobic tenor.The Greens have been unambiguously pro-refugee and are on the rise across Germany, especially so in Bavaria. They took second place and denied the CSU a majority for only the second time since 1949 – in elections fought under a proportional system.The environmentalists, who are less radical than their UK-based counterparts but nonetheless left of centre, are now flying high in the national polls, with an increasing number of surveys showing them taking second place.They have done this before, a few years ago, when a row over nuclear power was making headlines in Germany. Merkel neutered them simply by adopting their policies and pledging to close down nuclear plants. The pragmatic chancellor may have less room for manoeuvre this time, however – with pressures both to her left and right on immigration.AfD says Islam is not welcomeThere are other strands to the story, too. The social democrats, who are in coalition with Merkel’s conservatives at a federal level, lost voters to basically everyone, sinking for fourth place. Once a force to be reckoned with, they are now in serious need of a rethink and recovery if they are to even survive. They yet show little sign of having the energy to reinvent themselves.Their story is common across Europe, from France to the Netherlands from Greece to Italy where once-powerful centre-left social democratic parties are being eviscerated. Germany’s SPD has taken a particular beating from having twice now signed up to work with the conservatives, with little to show for it. When the government does things wrong they get blamed, when it does things right, they get little credit.Whether the Greens will stay on the up is not certain. German politics for the last decade has been a bit of a carousel, with minor parties getting some time in the sun between general elections as voters search around for an alternative before losing interest. The Greens, the Left, even the Pirate Party, have all at various points had temporary surges – but the only force that has sustained increased support so far has been the far right.But what does look certain is that Germany’s conservative establishment is not immune from the rot that has been afflicting its social democratic one. The centre right in European countries – who across the continent have weathered challenges to their dominance with far more resilience than their left-of-centre counterparts– will be watching with an interested fear.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

             Brexiteer MP has STERN message for Remainers wanting to THWART BrexitThe committee, which sits in Edinburgh and examines the expenditure, administration and policy of the Scotland Office, heard how some pensions could become \u0026ldquoillegal with a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspAlastair Ross, of the Association of British Insurers (AIB), said: You might be in this position where it could be deemed illegal to actually pay somebody the pension that they\u0027ve paid into.This is the advice that we\u0027re getting, dependent on the attitude of the regulator of the country into which you are paying that payment.If it\u0027s considered a regulatory activity then it could be deemed illegal if you do not have consent under a no-deal scenario.That would be a very stark position, but that\u0027s the situation that we\u0027re looking at.\u0026nbspBrexit news: A no-deal Brexit could harm pensioners, finance experts claimed (Image: AFP)The AIB had already spoken against the UK leaving the EU without a deal.In a previous statement on Brexit, the organisation said such a scenario would leave insurance contracts in legal limbo, with firms unsure if they could legally pay claims for contracts drawn up before Brexit.During today\u0026rsquos hearing, Mr Ross repeated the AIB\u0026rsquos warning, saying holidaymakers could lose access to EU health insurance cards in case of a no-deal Brexit.This would put significant pressure on travel insurance premiums, while any requirement to reintroduce insurance Green Cards to enable motorists to drive in Europe could be an extensive exercise, he continued.\u0026nbsp                \u0026lsquoStubborn EU\u0027 attacked by expert for \u0027IRRATIONAL\u0027 Brexit strategyBrexit news: Donald Tusk said a no-deal Brexit is \u0027more likely than ever\u0027 (Image: )The AIB and the other organisations taking part to the meeting were asked by the committee to depict what they believe would happen \u0026ldquoto the continuity of cross-border financial contracts between the UK and EU, and what would this mean for firms and consumers.\u0026nbspConor Lawlor, of UK Finance, the trade association for the finance and banking industry, warned on the potential losses faced by firms working across the border.He said: There are about 27 trillion to 29 trillion dollars (\u0026pound20 trillion to \u0026pound22 trillion) worth of contracts agreed between the UK and the rest of the European Union.The majority of these are insurance and derivatives risk management tools that are incredibly important to supply chains and businesses across Europe.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Theresa May spoke to the Commons earlier today (Image: AFP)If the UK is unplugged from the European Union overnight, a lot of those contracts don\u0027t fall away, they\u0027re still fundamentally based on commercial or corporate law.What\u0027s difficult to do is intervene in those contracts because that would be deemed a regulated activity.In the best-case scenario it means increased costs, in the worst-case scenario it means the business can\u0027t function because a counter-party can\u0027t intervene and make the contract work in the way that it should.The committee\u0027s meeting comes as Theresa May warned parliament the UK may agree on a temporary backstop to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland

The earlier people start saving, the better, if working beyond retirement and money worries in later life are to be avoided.He said workplace pensions, where staff are automatically enrolled in a scheme by their employer, have gone some way to challenging the UK savings gap. But he would like to see a more ambitious increase in the minimum contribution level. He also called for improved access to adult financial education and greater simplicity and transparency from financial services providers.These measures would certainly help to prevent the situation some savers in our research are facing, Mr Harrison added. The study of 40,000 UK savers showed 20 per cent of over-55s planned to work beyond retirement age while half said they would get by on a lower income and give up work as planned.On average, those aged between 55 and 64 said they put by \u0026pound92 a month for their pension, compared with an average across all age groups of \u0026pound358. Many had no plans in place to cover additional outgoings like care costs. Today\u0027s retirees are reaching pensionable age with an average of \u0026pound50,000 saved, according to analysis by Royal London.                MORNING MEETING: FCA calls for review into annuity sales                 ISA savings: Average saving levels \u0027NOT ENOUGH\u0027 to pay for even ONE...The maximum state pension is currently worth \u0026pound8,545.50, meaning a 20-year retirement would require a personal pension pot worth \u0026pound289,090 to reach the \u0026pound23,000-a-year level. While 42 per cent said they were unhappy with their financial position, 16 per cent insisted they were too busy to sort their finances out while 25 per cent admitted to not knowing where to start.Former pensions minister Baroness Altmann said: These figures reveal the shocking truth that millions of people are not preparing properly for retirement. Many will need money for care too, which is over and above an ordinary pension income.A recent report revealed that dementia sufferers typically spend \u0026pound100,000 on care. Alzheimer\u0027s Society is calling for an end to the fundamental injustice that sees sufferers forking out hundreds of thousands of pounds after their diagnosis.Many people have not saved enough for a comfortable retirement  (Image: Getty)Comment by Baroness AltmannSo many people know they should be saving for their retirement but just keep putting it off.Some might not even have taken the time to check out what sort of income they may be heading towards when they stop working.One way to encourage yourself to put more money away for the future is to have a financial plan.Get some guidance and advice so you have a proper idea about what your income might be in case you need to make up the gap.Financial planning should be part of everyday thinking.I have always been in favour of a mid-life MOT, perhaps at the age of 50.This is when most people tend to know how much they have got set aside and it\u0027s useful to see how much more you may need to put in.Flexibility Long-term planning is crucial.If you are not prepared the reality is it may be too late to amass an adequate pension pot by the time you reach later life.If you put more money aside it gives you flexibility and choice as to what type of lifestyle you will be able to lead.The way to prepare for what we all hope will be a long and happy retirement is to plan ahead and make sure you are saving as much as possible when you can.Not putting money aside means either working longer, living on much less than you\u0027d like \u0026ndash or both.Many people will need money for care too.The costs can be enormous and planning ahead can avoid terrible problems later on.\u0026bull Baroness Altmann is a former pensions minister.

This has potentially serious implications for the weaker UK regions.In the worst-case scenario, some of the most vulnerable regions could suffer a \u0027triple whammy\u0027 - a very significant loss of potential economic output, the loss of EU funding and third, unless fiscal transfers from stronger parts of the UK economy can be maintained at the same level to mitigate these impacts, the combined economic shock could be severe.

As we head towards the start of November, confidence is very low but there are signs it may turn more changeable again.\u0026ldquoTemperatures will probably be close to normal overall, but in more settled weather it is likely to be colder than average, especially overnight.Coronal holes are areas in the matter around the sun \u0026ndash its corona \u0026ndash which have a lower density compared to the rest of the corona and are therefore darker.They form part of the sun\u0026rsquos surface and are in constant motion changing and reshaping emitting solar particles at a varying rate.They are thought to exert an influence over space weather leading to disturbances and are also believed to be linked to patterns of weather on Earth.The current lowest UK temperature recorded during October is -11.7C (10.94F) recorded in 1948 in the Highlands of Scotland.

Salvini tells Commission\u0027s Juncker to \u0027SHUSH\u0027 amid ongoing budget row                \u0027Goodbye Merkel!\u0027 Matteo Salvini has these BRUTAL words fo EU leaders The budget is aimed at delivering on key campaign promises, includes a pledge to cut income and corporate tax \u0026ndash but economists fear it could cost upward of \u0026euro10billion.Final cabinet approval of the spending plans has been delayed until today, with government sources saying there were tensions between the ruling coalition parties over plans for a partial tax amnesty.However, speaking last night, Mr Salvini was bullish about the proposals, saying during a press conference: I am extremely happy, we are keeping our promises, slowly but bravely.\u0026ldquoWe are dismantling the previous pension law, giving back the right to work to 400,000 Italians.\u0026nbspGiuseppe Conti and Matteo Salvini confer at the press conference (Image: )Giuseppe Conte Matteo Salvini Luigi Di Maio (Image: )\u0026ldquoWe are not raising taxes of any kind for 2019.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who was appointed to his post at the recommendation of Mr Salvini and coalition partner, Five Star Movement (MS5) leader Luigi Di Maio, added: \u0026ldquoWe are keeping all our promises, we are very happy with this budget.This is the outcome of a lot of work and a lot of meetings that we have transparently made public.\u0026ldquoWe have worked on a project, more than on a budget, we have worked on a project that the country needs, that citizens need.\u0026nbsp                Salvini tells EU to \u0027get a grip\u0027 as he vows to confirm new budget plan                END OF THE EUROZONE: Italy parties want to STOP using EU currency The Italian Government\u0027s stance is unlikely to please Jean-Claude Juncker (Image: )\u0026ldquoAnd, best of all, we are keeping the accounts in order, and delivering on our promises at the same time.His comments followed a speech to Italy\u0027s Senate in which he said:\u0026nbspItaly is an EU founder and a net contributor. Belonging to Europe is an essential part of the program to improve socio-economic conditions of Italians and Europeans. We are going to Brussels with a budget we are proud of and on which we want to dialogue without prejudice. Austerity is no longer viable\u0026nbspThe budget relies on Government forecasts suggesting Italy\u0027s high debt to GDP ratio, currently about 130 percent, will fall to 126.7 percent of GDP in 2021.Economists are concerned at the plans, with Thanos Vamvakidis, head of G-10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, telling CNBC: \u0026ldquoWe believe that this budget cannot possibly be accepted by the EU, it is a clear violation of the fiscal rules.\u0026ldquoThe Italian government has shown some signs they\u0027re willing to compromise but they\u0027re still far apart and we need some more market discipline.Mr Salvini has also indicated he wants Italy to have a closer relationship with Vladimir Putin (Image: )Meanwhile, in a separate move also likely to alarm Brussels, Mr Conte said European Union sanctions against Russia were damaging Italian companies, adding that his government wanted to deepen its ties with Moscow.His remarks came a day after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini had defined the EU sanctions a social, cultural and economic absurdity.In the coalition contract drawn up in May, Italy\u0027s ruling parties wrote that Russia should not be seen as a menace but rather an economic and commercial partner, potentially increasingly significant.Rome has long said that existing sanctions were damaging Italian firms trading with Moscow, and calls for de-escalating tensions with Moscow have grown louder since a new anti-establishment government took office in Italy in June.Mr Salvini is an admirer of Russian President Mr Putin and has rejected allegations of Russian meddling in Western elections.A European Commission spokeswoman said: The Commission has received draft budgetary plans for 2019 from all 19 euro area Member States.The Commission will now begin its assessment of the draft budgetary plans.We will present our Opinions once these assessments have been completed, before the end of November.This is all part of the normal European Semester process, the EU\u0027s economic policy coordination cycle, and happens each year.

In person, he is a decent, thoughtful man. His band are not bad. But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away. He says: “The war was a colour war. You’re seeing it as they saw it. And they saw it in colour.”World War One never felt closer. And the humour, humanity and courage of the men who fought it has never been more heartbreaking.BEST wishes for the future to Trevor Engelson and his bride Tracey Kurland, who were married in a low-key ceremony in Calornia last weekend.Andyou don’t recognise the names, that is because Mr Engelson has chosen to keep a discreet silence on the subject of his two-year marriage to Meghan Markle.And in an age where every broken relationship is ­dissected on social media, isn’t it refreshing to see a man who can keep a dignied silence “WE lost the match but won the battle,” claimed Conor McGregor after his beating in last weekend’s UFC .  What planet was that victory on then, Conor To the casual fan it looked like McGregor  followed up months of denigrating Khabib Nurmagomedov with a feeble performance in the octagon and a lack of grace in defeat.True, Khabib spoilt his victory by jumping into the crowd to continue the punch-up with McGregor’s corner.  But for the le of me I can’t see how Conor McGregor can claim anything other than unconditional surrender. Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor. But after the squalid scenes around Conor v Khabib, many of us will be turning off the MMA.Even Mike Tyson was shocked.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

Now ministers are set to use the time to fix problems in the system - but the programme wont be halted or scrapped.A series of documents revealed that a whole raft of new changes could be coming to make the transition easier for Brits -they are signed off by the Treasury.It comes after a revolt by Tory backbenchers who demanded that extra cash be put in to soften the blow for Brits on benefits.Plans have been drawn up to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to continue paying some benefits to claimants for two weeks after their new Universal Credit claim has been made.Housing benefit tenants can already get this two week space, after reports of Brits going into debt at last years Budget.The documents also revealed that more help would be given to the self employed, and that the advance payments will be spread out and paid back over a longer amount of time.Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said today the news was proof that the government have quietly accepted that their flagship social security programme isnt working.She went on: The Government must stop the roll out of Universal Credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about whats going on and what action the Government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.And ex-Labour MP Frank Field said the changes that could take place arent enough - and demanded benefits must continue until the new benefit is up and running into your bank account and that paying back advance payments more slowly should include other historic debts too.Dame Louise Casey said the design was flawed from the outset and it had pushed people further and further into debt because it tried to force people to be paid monthly.She told Radio : The poorest people are often paid weekly and fortnightly - those are the people we need to help...

We need more time to find this global agreement and achieve the decisive progress we need to finalise this negotiation on Britains orderly withdrawal.We will take this time, calmly and seriously, to find this global agreement in the next weeks.And Mr Tusk added: Unfortunately, the report on the state of negotiations that I got from Michel Barnier today, as well as yesterdays debate in the House of Commons, give me no grounds for optimism before tomorrows European Council summit on Brexit.As I see it, the only grounds for hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides. However, for a breakthrough to take place we need more than goodwill, we need new facts.Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister Mayshe has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determinea breakthrough is possible.Last night, a group of eight senior ministers met over spicy meat pizza to air their frustration about the PM.The ministers who gathered in Andrea Leadsoms office included Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Liz Truss.They reportedly agreed they should continue backing Mrs May as she battles to fight off Brussels attempts to carve off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary who attended the meeting, said today: No one is planning on resigning. We are all doing our jobs and we are trying to get the best deal for this country, and thats it.Labour MP Virendra Sharma, a backer of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, mocked the ministers for failing to launch a challenge to the PM.He said: After days of briefing about their plot we expected these Brexiteers to give the Prime Minister a pizza their mind. It seems like they folded quicker than a calzone.And Tory backbenchers have denied they want to force Mrs May out of office.Steve Baker, the Brexiteers shop steward, admitted: “There really isn’t time for a long leadership contest. And there aren’t the Eurosceptic numbers to change Prime Minister.”But Mrs May could face a tougher challenge from the DUP, which is propping up her majority in Parliament.Nigel Dodds, the partys leader in Westminster, said thatshe tries to put a border in the Irish Sea the DUP will say: How can we continue implement your domestic agenda, your budgets and everything  He added: Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act there are a lot of things that we can not support in terms of the government’s domestic and financial and welfare agenda which does not trigger the possibility of Jeremy Corbyn coming into No.”This week European leaders warned that No Deal is closer than ever after talks between officials broke down on Sunday night.But Mrs Mays ministers have insisted that eventhere isnt a Brexit deal this week, one could be struck at a special summit next month.THERESA May must ramp up No Deal preparations or risk Brexit talks resulting in total chaos, ex-Tory leader William Hague warned today.The respected peer called on the PM to start building lorry parks and drawing up customs forms so that Britain is ready for disruption at our borders.Lord Hague also said Mrs May should consider ripping up the blueprint for Brexit negotiations - and consider signing up to the European Economic Area for the next three years.He warned the Tories are at breaking point as MPs row over whether or not to back the PM as she heads to Brussels for talks with European leaders.The former Foreign Secretary said: It is now essential to turn up to full throttle the preparations for leaving without a deal.Yes, that sadly means everything from printing customs forms to building lorry parks in Kent.A No Deal Brexit is extremely undesirable, and might be prevented by Parliament, but since it could happen it has to be prepared for psychologically and politically, not just logistically.He added that fresh thinking - which could include adopting an EEA solution to give the Government more time to negotiate a deal - could help Mrs May shore up her position."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442057890.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"photo gran chinese ghost girls v a museum","story":"Jane Cunningham was snapping pictures of her family in East London and didn’t see anything amiss.But when she got back and looked at the day’s iPhone pictures she noticed two small Chinese girls in the background, apparently peering out of a window.The spooky photograph shows the two small women looking towards the camera, with one half-submerged in the wall - even though the room they were in was empty.And now Ms Cunningham is convinced she has caught spirits from the other side on film.The -year-old said of her trip to the museum in Bethnal Green, East London: “I did not expect to see these spirits at all. It was really crazy.“My daughter asked me to take some photographs of her and it was not until several hours later that we realised these strange people were in the photograph.“It was a really rainy day and there was no one outdoors. These two oriental women are very tiny and clearly dressed in outfits from another era.“You cannot see the one inside the wall and can just see her face, but the one that was in frills, was half in and half out the building.“It was very out of place as everyone had anoraks on and hoods because it was a rainy day.“That is what fascinated me so much.”Alongside the two female ghosts, Ms Cunningham also saw a purple orb in the shape of a skull on another picture.She added: “The skull above was really quite frightening because it showed that maybe the girls had been tortured or maybe had lived in a horrible situation back then during the th century - they had to work day and night, doing such intricate work.”The phantoms were located in the west wing of the building, in the area designated for the storage of visitors’ prams and buggies.The room is completely plain and there are no pictures on the walls or displays whatsoever.Ms Cunningham, of Stockwell, South London, added: “The building was chocka that day, so we had to take our pram around with us, so there was simply no room for humans to be in that room.“It was crazy because the whole area was chock-a-block with prams, and it was a grey and miserable day so it’s just incredible that someone would be looking through the window like that - half-in and half-out.”The sight of the spectral visitors inspired Ms Cunningham to conduct research into the area and the museum in particular.She said: “Because I am spiritual, I was motivated to undertake research to find out more about these girls. These girls were spirits and they were trying to come through.“I did a bit of research and found out that during the th century the building was owned by the gentry but they couldn’t afford to complete its decoration.“It essentially became a women’s prison then - housing women to finish off the decoration and building.“So I presume these women were part of that society in that prison from the orient and they were trying to come through to me and show me they were there.”Ms Cunningham admits to being a spiritual person who has seen phantoms and ghosts of family members since the age of , including her grandmother.She said: “My house now has a seven-year-old little girl who wasn’t going anywhere until I identied her.“I didn’t know her and could not recognise her, so she was just a nuisance really. It was not until my boyfriend recognised her that she went.”She hasn’t ed to the museum yet, but is “excited to visit to check out the area again.”She called both the VA Museum of Childhood and the VA Museum but has not heard back.The museum was founded in  as the Bethnal Green Museum and now houses the largest collection of childhood objects in the UK.The museum has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442069844.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"new photos sunken british tanks d day","story":"The war tanks sunk during Operation Smash - a huge training exercise held on a Dorset beach in April , just weeks ahead of the Normandy landings.Six lives were lost during the drill - but a lesson was learnt so that, on D-Day, British and Canadian tanks were launched in shallow water.Nick Reed from The Isle of Purbeck Sub Aqua Club, which has launched a project to map the history of the seven sunken tanks, said the six soldiers lost did not die in vain.Everybody says that Operation Smash was an absolute, complete disaster, said Nick.Well,  tanks were launched and seven sank, so that means  got to shore in this exercise and from that the British learnt a lesson.So when the British and Canadians launched their tanks on D-Day, they didnt launch theirs offshore because it was too rough.Whereas the Americans launched theirs five kilometres offshore.The result of the American decision is well-known - just two of the  tanks initially deployed to storm Omaha beach made it ashore.Omaha would be the bloodiest of the D-Day beaches.If we hadnt got armoured support ashore on D-Day, our troops may not have established a beach head, said Mr Reed.So in many ways the sacrice of those six guys may have changed the course of World War Two - thats the way we like to think of it.Their sacrice wasnt in vain, things were learnt from it and maybe that contributed to the success of D-Day.Conditions at the e site off Studland Beach are notoriously changeable, making the sunken tanks a challenge to photograph.The new images of them are thought to be the clearest ever taken.Paul Pettitt, who photographed the wrecks with his we Alison, said: Its rough as you like.Those pictures were done over the course of a whole summer. Some days we went down and werent able to get anything.The worst problem is the wind direction which kicks up the silt and sand on the bottom, and makes it go very gloomy down there.But we got a lucky break one day when we got some really clear visibility and were able to get these pictures.The tanks have also taken on new lives as articial reefs.Theyre absolutely full of wildle, said Mr Reed.There are several big conger eels living in one of the main tanks, theres crabs, theres lobsters, theres big shoals of fish that swim around them.Thats almost like a commemoration of the men themselves - men died on these tanks but these tanks now are providing le to the marine animals around the area.The Duplex Drive Valentine tanks were equipped with a buoyant canvas screen which could be raised up around the tank and sat above the water line.But soon after the tanks were launched the wind changed and water started to sweep over the top of the screens.They were launched in suitable conditions but the wind blew up just after they were launched, said Mr Reed.The skirts, which provided the buoyancy, were only about a metre above the water - and obviously what keeps water out will keep water in.So I think most of them were swamped and sank.Earlier this year, a man believed to be the last-surviving soldier from Operation Smash - who is also a crew member from one of the doomed tanks - was located.Albert Price, , is now living in the West Midlands.Its hoped hell be able to attend a  year commemoration of Operation Smash next year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442115238.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"terrified mum posts 50 an hour job ad for someone to take her kids trick or treating on halloween","story":"The single mother, who suffers from severe social anxiety, is offering £-an-hour to look after her three young children.She said that she gets “very scared at Halloween because of the costumes and speaking to strangers to ask for sweets for the kids.”She posted the ad on on Childcare, a site connecting parents with nannies, tutors and babysitters with more than . million users nationwide.Her post, which was submitted last week, is a last resort as she has been unable to find anyone  to treat her kids.But the mum won’t let that stop her three children, aged nine, seven and three, having a great time.The ad calls for a professional to help the children into their costumes and lead them trick or treating from pm to pm on October .The founder of Childchare, Richard Conway, said: “When I saw this advert put onto the website, I wanted to help the woman instantly.“She’s clearly trying to do the best for her children and is more than happy to pay someone to perform this service.“I got in touch with her to ask how I could help, and promoting this advert seemed like the best way I could help her.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441919616.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"960","title":"young entrepreneur kicked out of school fixes oaps fences for free","story":"Caring Jon Horne set up his own fencing business at the age of  after getting kicked out of school four years earlier.The -year-old decided to help OAPs for free after witnessing them getting ripped off by rogue traders.He also continually came across war veterans who admitted they had to choose between food and heating and getting basic home repairs done.Jon set up JD Property Services in Birmingham at the age of  and felt compelled to help the older generation after seeing some charged several times what they should be for simple jobs.And his out-of-the-ordinary acts of kindness have now seen him gain attention online, with his original Facebook post gathering almost , messages of support and a further , messages sent to him directly.

It comes hours after Tory welfare chief Esther McVey confirmed she will migrate no more than , existing claimants on to the benefit until mid-. Her confession suggests the vast majority of the UKs .million existing benefit claimants will not begin so-called managed migration until then. Now the BBC reports this move will extend UCs estimated finish date from March  to December , the ninth delay to the rollout. And a document leaked to the Corporation also reveals a string of measures to offer people more help. Hard-up families could now get higher transition payments and lower loan repayments after UC drove desperate people to rent arrears, food banks and prostitution. But crucially, there is NO mention of a halt to the rollout or any change to the taper rate - a core problem with the hated policy.  Instead, according to the document obtained by the BBC, government officials plan to:Continue paying income support, ESA and jobseekers allowance for two weeks after someone makes a UC claim Reduce deductions when some is paying back an advance loan from % to % of monthly benefit Give more help to the self-employed after warnings the policy will crush themThe changes would reportedly cost hundreds of millions of pounds . But an extract from the document also warns the changes might not even be possible. We can currently offer no assurance that ultimately these proposals will prove to be deliverable, can survive legal challenges where they can be delivered, and do not invite new political criticism by generating new policy issues, it says, according to the BBC.  Critics are likely to say the measures - which have emerged a year after a separate pound.bn package of tweaks - are not enough. There is no commitment to halt the rollout, and no mention in the BBCs report of the taper rate. Universal Credit is handed over in one payment, which tapers away by p for every extra pound people earn above pound a month. Critics have complained that this is too steep and leaves families worse off. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said the leaked measures could reduce” hardship. But she warned: “These measures alone will not solve all of the problems. The government must make changes to ensure no one is left without enough to get by.”  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “The Government must stop the roll out of Universal Credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about whats going on and what action the Government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system. Paul Noblet of the charity Centrepoint said: “Having tested the system, the government is finally learning it still has a long way to go before it fulfils its aim of supporting those who need help the most.” Department for Work and Pensionssources did not deny the end date - estimated as March  by the National Audit Office just months ago - could become December , saying only it would be in . A DWP source insisted the managed migration of .million claimants would still begin in July .  But they conceded the phasing of that migration was open to change - and a spokesman confirmed the department would work with a maximum of , people in the first year. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, who last week admitted some UC claimants will be worse off, has repeatedly said she was looking at further changes to the system. Yesterday she told MPs: Under the process of managed migration, the roll-out will be slow and measured. It will start not in January , but later in the year. For a further year we will be learning as we go with a small amount of people - maybe , - to ensure that the system is right. More than , people have signed the Mirrors petition to halt the rollout. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. A DWP spokeswoman confirmed: “We have long said that we will take a slow and measured approach to managed migration. This will not begin in January , but later in the year, after a period of preparation. For a further year we will then begin migration working with a maximum of , people, continuing with our ‘test and learn’ approach. This is to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptions as we go.” The spokeswoman added: “We will publish full plans for the next stage of Universal Credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.

The South Thanet MP, , along with his election agent Nathan Gray, , and party activist Marion Little, , are alleged to have been complicit in submitting  expenditure declarations following his victory on May . Southwark Crown Court heard the Conservative Party put extra resources into the campaign to win the Kent seat because prior to the EU referendum Ukips support was on the rise. Nigel Farage indicated he would step down as Ukip leaderhe failed to win South Thanet so it was clear this was not going to be any ordinary election campaign, prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors. He said it became a two-horse race won by Mackinlay with a majority of around , in an electorate of ,, which Gray later described in an email to Little as a truly magnicent election campaign.  Spending limits apply equally to every prospective Parliamentary candidate of every political hue across the UK and those limits seek to ensure integrity and public confidence in the most obvious example of this countrys democratic process, namely a general election, the prosecutor continued. He said expenditure is tightly regulated over two stages - a short and a long campaign - and it is the job of a Parliamentary candidate and their election agent to ensure limits are scrupulously observed. Declarable expenses include the costs involved to get the candidate elected, such as printing of leaflets, putting up posters and staff costs, such as the employment of Gray as an election agent, Mr Jafferjee explained. In South Thanet the limit for the expenditure was just over pound,, while for the short campaign it was just over pound,. Declarations made by Mackinlay and Gray came in below the limit, at pound, and pound, respectively. But Mr Jafferjee said: It is the prosecution case that neither of these declarations as to expenditure - the longfigure of just over pound, and the shortfigure of just under pound, - were true, and by some considerable margin, though that does not matter. Each of these three defendants were complicit in advancing those  declarations. He told jurors a signature purporting to be Nathan Grays in relation to the longhad been forged. The court heard Little, along with a press officer, was sent from Conservative Campaign Headquartersto stay in the Royal Harbour Hotel in Ramsgate, arriving on March , . The prosecutor told jurors they worked to get Mackinlay elected from the moment they arrived, while Little wrote an email in which she described herself as being marooned in South Thanet. Marion Little went onto effectively manage Craig Mackinlays election campaign so that he would be elected and Nigel Farage would be defeated, he said. This was not just what is known as a marginal seat, but it was a contest which could see off Nigel Farages Parliamentary ambitions forever. The court heard Little told police she was not working for Mackinlay but carrying out national campaign work. She now claims she went to Kent to prevent the election of Ukip and the benefit to Mackinlay was collateral to that, jurors were told. But Mr Jafferjee said: While we accept she may have been doing some things nationally, she was there for one purpose. The prosecutor said Mackinlay will blame his lack of experience and unawareness of what Little and others were doing. Grays defence will similarly highlight his inexperience, stating he was marginalised by the arrival of Little, and that he has no idea how his forged signature came about, the court heard. But Mr Jafferjee said: It is the prosecution case each of these defendants involved themselves in a deliberate under-declaration and non-declaration of election expenses. Mackinlay, from Ramsgate, Kent, denies two charges of making a  election expenses declaration under the Representation of the People Act . Gray, of Hawkhurst, Kent, denies one charge of making a  election expenses declaration and a further charge of using a  instrument under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act . Little, of Ware, Hertfordshire denies three counts of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence under the Serious Crime Act . They are all on unconditional bail. The trial, which is expected to last until December, continues.

I had dated an older man previously and I’d always been infatuated with older men when I was younger. “Kids were crushing on Justin Bieber and Jesse McCartney and I loved Johnny Depp, Jeff Goldblum and Slash, so for me it was natural.” John said: “Well were both haunt actors and love comic books, as well as heavy metal, so those were big factors for us.  Plus, in our first encounter, we talked for something like three hours, and after that I couldnt stop thinking about her. “The age gap was a little tough for me, only because I never dated someone with this much of an age split, but I wouldnt change this for anything. “Both of our families were hesitant. I think more on my side than hers, however my mum came around to it when she saw how we interact with each other, and that she wasnt a frivolous, flighty, type of a person. “I think the most dficult thing in our relationship is that were both in the arts and that makes things really tight financially for us. I know Ive had to come a long way due to some very hard times, but we kind of work together through these things.” John and Lexsy are excitedly getting ready for their wedding at the end of the month and are looking to move to LA.  Although, marrying John means that Lexsy will technically be his children’s stepmum, this isn’t a label she wants to be known by. Lexsy hit back at people who might not agree with their age gap and said their relationship is the same as everyone ’s. “We are going to move to LA to hit the ground running on our careers in acting and makeup,” said Lexsy. “We have talked about kids and I would like to have just one kid. “Since I’m marrying him Im technically his children’s stepmum, but I just want to be called by my name and they already have a mum. I feel uncomfortable calling myself their stepmum since they are grown adults. “Our relationship is a big norm in the film industry and has been for decades. It’s not out of the ordinaryyou really think about it. “Our relationship is just like everyone ’s. The only time our relationship is dferent is on outward appearance. We don’t see each other’s ages. “We have fights, we struggle with money, we go on fun dates or stay in and watch Law and Order in our pyjamas. We are just as normal as anyone . “Rarely people askI’m his daughter but most of the time we’ve been lucky with people calling me his girlfriend or sometimes his we.” "},{"url":null,"title":"argos recalls childrens bunk bed","story":"NewsArgos recalls childrens bunk bed over fears ladder could injure totsThe high street retailer is advising customers who bought the Ohio High Sleeper to stop using it immediately while a replacement is organisedShareCommentsByLucy Clarke-Billings:,  OCT NewsArgos is offering a replacement ladder to all customers \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailArgos is recalling a childrens bunk bed after parents reported the ladder rungs were prone to snapping.

Prince George, the first child of Prince William and Kate Middleton, was born on July ,  to huge media coverage worldwide. For days before the birth of the new heir, camera crews and journalists were camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Marys Hospital.While covering the birth from outside the hospital, McCoy memorably admitted that there was not all that much to reveal as the Duchess of Cambridge was in labour . He said: Well, plenty more to come from here of course. None of it news because that will come from Buckingham Palace. But that wont stop us. The video quickly went viral, adding some humour to the days of repetitive coverage. Speaking about the viral video, the veteran BBC newsreader said he did the right thing by reporting there was no news.Speaking to the Radio Times , McCoy said: “I do know they [the royals] were watching in the hospital when the Duchess of Cambridge was giving birth to Prince George and I was outside.Someone told me the family thought I’d got it absolutely right. They were watching and wondering what on earth was going on outside.  Nothing was happening and I said as such – and it’s much better than some of my rivals who were speculating on the level of dilation. I think once you get into that realm of commentating, you’ve lost the plot.” Last year, McCoy was equally sarcastic when reporting on the Duchess of Cambridges due date for Prince Louis. Simon read out the breaking news statement live on air - adding his own dry wit when it came to the delivery. He said: “Now, baring in mind that they announced that she was pregnant back in September and it was thought that she was around two or three months pregnant, I’m not sure how much news this really is.”  Simon then added: But anyway, its April so clear your diaries, get the time booked off cause thats what Im doing. Kate gave birth to Prince Louis on April  this year and Princess Charlotte was born on May , . Meanwhile, there is another royal baby on the way as Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are expecting their first child early next year.

Its driver and a station manager were filmed trying to pull open one of the doors, before the manager was reportedly forced to clamber into a window and manually release the door locks. The incident has been described as shambolic.

A younger guard struggled with opening the door. The video I took was only the second go at opening it. He had to climb through a window to access some button which eventually worked.  He added: That wasnt the end of it though because we were told the train manager had not arrived. We eventually just left without any sort of announcement. It was a bit shambolic. You understand that sometimes organisations are thrown into unexpected situations, and the coach transport was set up well, but the communication just seemed to get worse as we got further into Cornwall.

Francis Courtenay, , put up the ft hay mountain after his application for three new homes on his land was refused on the grounds they would have been an eyesore. He decided to stack bales on top of each other higher than the proposed homes to make a point. But his protest backfired spectacularly when several bales flew off the top as Storm Callum hit. They broke several gravestones and crushed flowers left at the neighbouring churchyard.  The wreckage at the Grade II listed St Thomas A Beckett church in Newton Tracey near Barnstaple, Devon, has left many in the village furious. Francis - who has owned the land since  - has now apologised to the vicar for what he said was an accident and promised to put it right. But he has vowed to leave the bales up until he gets planning permission. He said: The bales were put higher than the houses would have been and I just wanted to make a point. We had a bit of a disaster though and there was a terric gale, which moved three bales. It blew off the top ones but I will put everything right and sincerely apologised to the vicar. He said he understands that accidents happen. I understand now that the wall was too high. I will make the graves right and I have apologised unreservedly to the vicar for that. It was a monumental cock up and I am sorry for that. But Mr Courtenay remains unrepentant about the wall itself and has vowed to leave it there for the near future. He added: It got stopped by just one woman from Historic England complaining that it may have a visual effect on the church. I told the village what I was going to do. The vast majority of local people, including the vicar, church and the parish council, have been very supportive.  That field is a prime development site and there is no reason to refuse planning there. I can understand that people may be upset about it, but its not there to upset the locals. Its only upset the awkward ones anyway. I will leave it there until Historic England sorts the matter out. Mr Courtenay said the objections on visual grounds were ridiculous and that he built the wall to show them a visual disturbance. He said: They said thehouses would cause a visual effect on the church, which is a joke. I told them You think its a visual effect  Ill give you a visual effect. Residents in Newton Tracey have been left fuming by Mr Courtenays hay bale tower. Chris Moore said he believes the bales were erected to spite the villagers who objected to the planning application. He said: Some people in the village said it would spoil the beautul views, so he moved the bails in front of the church to block their view of the countryside. It is a very high wall, five bales high in places. It is very unstable and could be dangerous. Everyone in the parish is fuming, because they believe he did it to spite them. It could have been really dangerous, imaginethere had been someone there when the bales blew off. The bales that broke the graves have been moved now, but the broken headstones and squashed flowers are still there. Its all so unnecessary.  Historic England said it had raised objections as the principle of development will result in harm to the signicance of the grade II listed church. North Devon District Council subsequently rejected the initial plans due to a lack of affordable housing provision and an increase in traffic. The decision notice also states that the proximity to the listed church and its open, rural and undeveloped setting would be to the signicant detriment of the church. It is also believed that the site may be of medieval and Roman archaeological signicance.

Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.

When is Spring   For all those trying to work out when the next royal baby will arrive, the specic dates of when Spring falls is also complicated. There are actually two dferent dates for when Spring begins - Meteorological or Astronomical - so it depends on which system you use. To complicate it further, the seasons are not always the sameso the start and end dates can fall on a dferent times each year. Meteorological Spring looks at the seasons by weather are based on temperature cycles as well as the calendar.  This year it fell on March  and ended on May , and it  fall on the same dates.

She is reportedly in her second trimester and has had her three month scan. However, going by general rule that pregnancy lasts around  weeks, it looks like Meghan will give birth around mid-April. The couple got married in May following a whirlwind romance and became pregnant within month of their glamorous wedding. There has been much speculation around when the couple conceived with many surmising it was between their mini-moon to Dublin and the wedding of Harrys pal on August which was also Meghans birthday.  Where will the baby be born  Kate Middleton has given birth to her three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis at the private Lindo Wing in St Marys Hospital, Paddington.

Where will the baby fall in the line of succession  Seventh in line. The baby will bump Harrys uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queens youngest son - drops out of the top  for the first time to th in line.

I also took his dog Jack up to see him, I put him on his bed and he said his goodbyes - they were inseparable. “On Thursday I asked himhe was in pain and he squeezed my finger and his morphine was increased. Then on Friday we were changing his pyjamas, we were both holding him and Pete said ‘he’s going’. Callum took a few breaths and he went in our arms. We both hugged him, we were just crying, both of us in tears.”  Callums funeral is being held today and Newcastle United footballer Paul Dummett will be joining mourners after becoming friends with Callum during his illness. It was two years ago when Callum had a routine test for a blood disorder he shares with his mother that it revealed the entirely unconnected disease - acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It was then Magpies-mad Callum struck up a friendship with Dummett after a friend of Pete’s said he had known the left back from being a kid. And after Dummett heard of Callum’s plight, he popped round to his house with a signed shirt and stayed for two hours playing FIFA games on the Playstation. From that moment their friendship grew as they spent hours on numerous occasions playing Playstation - ending with a FIFA draw between the pair.  “They became good friends, Paul would come to ours and play FIFA with Callum for a couple of hours at a time. He’s a really nice bloke and he’s coming to Callum’s funeral,” said Pete. After Callum was diagnosed, the Gosforth Junior High Academy pupil went through chemotherapy and a donor match was made for a bone marrow transplant. Callum, who has seven-year-old brother Liam, spent seven weeks in a sterile bubble at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary and started to get better. He went back to school in September  and was building up his hours but became unwell again. Season ticket holder Callum underwent more tests and in January  the family’s worst nightmare was confirmed when doctors said a rare situation had occurred and a dferent kind of leukaemia - acute myeloid leukaemia - had taken over.  “As far as we were concerned he was cured. He was slowing getting back to school and started to get back to his football at Kingston Park Football Club Under s,” said Pete. But mother’s intuition kicked in and Callum’s illness set alarm bells ringing with Michelle. She said: “I just knew something was wrong, he was showing symptoms like before, he was pale and was tired and going straight to bed when he came in from school. I had the feeling it had come back but I never thought it would be a dferent kind of leukaemia. “We were toldhe had another bone marrow transplant, he would have a % survival rate, but we were willing to take the chance. Another donor was found but Callum’s chemo didn’t work and the leukaemia spread.  They said it was pointless to have another transplant and we were told nothing  could work. We were told to take him home and make memories.” Pete, who works at Tesco, added: “We told Callum the donor wasn’t ready, we didn’t want him to have nightmares. But I think he knew, he didn’t want to worry us. We were protecting him and he was protecting us.” Callum, who was given a Braveheart Award last year, began to get weaker and became really poorly in September and was confined to bed. Pete, , said: “It was just the week before he got really sick when Callum said ‘Dad, I want to get better,’ but we knew that wasn’t possible. “It’s heartbreaking really, we knew it was going to happen, we knew it was coming but we didn’t know when. Each day we thought was he going to go in his sleep  But he was here for seven months when they only gave him two weeks to a month to live. He was so strong.  “Liam was staying at his auntie Jacqui’s when Callum passed. It’s ashe knew and waited.” Liam is missing his big brother and is taking the responsibility of looking after Callum’s mischievous miniature Jack Russell. And in Callum’s coffin a photo of him with his brother and trusted pet is lying by his side, along with other pictures and messages. Parents and coaches from Kingston Park Football Club will also attend the funeral as they join family friends and NUFC’s Paul Dummett. “Callum is wearing his Newcastle United black and white strip, he was Newcastle mad, and we are playing Local Hero. He just loved his football,” added Michelle.

The -year-old, who lives in alone in a flat on the Mexican resort of Rosarito Beach, in the US, is believed to have been told the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were expecting only a short time before the rest of the world.Within a statement released by Kensington Palace yesterday morning, Doria Ragland said she was very happy about this lovely news and looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild.Hours later, Mr Markle pronounced himself overjoyed. But, according to reports, Meghan did not deliver the momentous news to her father. Instead, Doria is believed to have made the call.  It would seem by publishing scathing open letters to both Meghan and Prince Harry, staging pre-wedding paparazzi photographs and giving live interviews, Mr Markle has ostracised himself from his daughters le.According to the Daily Mail, he has written a letter to the happy couple regarding the pregnancy in which he told Meghan she would make a great mother because - despite their recent dficulties - he believed she remained a very loving and compassionate woman.He thinks she will be naturally maternal, the source added. He said he had been remembering when Doria found out she was pregnant with Meg, and how emotional he felt. He only hopes he can share some of the joy.  Royal aides have remained tight lipped over whether Meghan and Harry had told the Duchess’s father, Thomas Markle, of the news before the big announcement yesterday. Meghan has not spoken to her father since her May wedding to Harry after he admitted to a string of shameful secrets, including staging pictures with a paparazzi for cash and confessing to taking cocaine when she was a child. In a TV interview a month after the Duke and Duchess married, he revealed: She’s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there’s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon. As Meghans relationship with Prince Harry has developed since their first blind date, her relationship with Mr Markle has deteriortated.  Two years ago, she paid a touching tribute to him with a public post on Fathers Day. She wrote: Happy Fathers Day, daddy. Im still your buckaroo and to this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films  club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank you notes and giving me the signature Markle nose. I love you. It would seem that closeness is no more. Mr Markle already has five grandchildren by his son, Thomas Junior, and daughter, Samantha Grant. But it remains unknown whether he will ever meet his sixth.

Very low temperatures - which could break October records - have been forecast by WeatherAction.  WeatherAction’s Piers Corbyn told the: We are expecting some quite severe snowfall before the end of this month and it will not just be confined to the far north, this could reach parts of the midlands or even further south.

Councillor Greig said the practice has become “outdated and is detrimental to the area”.He added: “The West End office policy is a product of the s and has become seriously outdated. I have tried to fight against the tide by opposing inidual proposals seeking to convert housing into offices.“I also tried to stop some of the huge extensions built on to granite mansions. It is frustrating not to succeed. The policy creates an assumption in favour of offices that has been genuinely dficult to overcome. Aberdeen now has a considerable surplus of office space so we have a real opportunity tothe area back into a more residential community. Albyn Place and Queen’s Road have some of our most outstanding granite buildings yet we have let this unique heritage become compromised by promoting commercial use over housing.“In any other city these would be highly desirable homes instead of office accommodation. My hope is that the moratorium on affordable housing contributions that we agreed last week will encourage ato the original residential character.“I want the West End office policy to be scrapped or, at least, reviewed. It is time to start valuing and improving the West End environment.”The letter comes two weeks after planning permission was granted to turn  Queen’s Road into an office.Queen’s Cross and Harlaw Community Council objected to the plans, saying: “There are alreadyover  large billboards advertising vacant office space down Queen’s Road, and this does not take into account other empty offices not being advertised so obviously. Surely it would make more sense to leave the houses as they are on Queen’s Road and entice the businesses to open offices on Union Street, thus making our main street more active and vibrant with people.”Councillor Ryan Houghton said: “As we have seen with the Liberal Democrats over time they are not always at one when it comes to matters pertaining to policy as Councillor Ian Yuill voted against allowing for a moratorium on developers contributions while Councillor Greig voted to allow for the moratorium on affordable housing contributions.“If Councillor Greig thinks the West End office policy is a product of the s and has become seriously outdated, he and his Liberal Democrat group has an opportunity to change that as part of the local development plan which will be introduced to the council by officers before the end of the year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dons fans urged to plan ahead for travelling to league cup semi final","story":"ScotRail is urging Dons fans

We are going into the unknown a bit with playing Edusport.“We have had them watched but they’re dferent and it’s on the G park at Annan.“Butwe get the ball down like we did against Buckie that pitch will only benefit us.“The great thing about the Scottish Cup is you get something dferent to the teams you face every week in the league. We’re all looking forward to the challenge and hopefully we can get a result.”Rae was pleased with Fraserburgh’s win at the weekend, particularly with captain Ryan Christie, Scott Barbour, Gary Harris, Paul Campbell, Ryan Cowie and Jamie Beagrie all missing.Rae said: “It was a hard-fought win against Buckie. In the last two weeks against Buckie and Rothes we have been down to bare bones a bit in terms of numbers.“We’ve had some people playing out of position. But the players that have come in have all done well and they have been two great results to win against Rothes and then Buckie.”"},{"url":null,"title":"armstrong in different league and on quest to be a regular","story":"Stuart Armstrong believes showing patience will pay off in his quest to become an English Premier League regular.The Aberdeen-raised midfielder joined Southampton in the summer in a £ million move from Celtic.That transfer was well received in the Granite City, with Armstrong’s former team Dyce Boy’s Club receiving a six-figure fee due to Fa regulations on player development.So far, the Scotland international has been limited to six appearances for the St Mary’s outfit – with only two as starts.However, Armstrong believes his move down south will pay off.The -year-old says moving to the Premier League has been a step up.And he’s not short of competition, with Steven Davis, Oriol Romeu, James Ward-Prowse, Mario Lemina and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg all playing in his position.But Armstrong is biding his time in his quest to become a regular starter. He said: “It’s been a bit of a change for me joining Southampton.“It’s a dferent environment and a dferent league.“I’m trying to be patient and wait for my place in the team and hopefully that comes over the next few weeks and months.“I’ll just keep working hard and try to get into the team.“It’s a new environment and there is a lot of competition for places, especially in the middle of the park.“That’s something I need to work towards .”Armstrong was back north of the border on Sunday when he started for Scotland in the - friendly defeat to Portugal at Hampden.It was the former Dundee United player’s eighth cap for his country.After missing out on last Thursday’s dismal - UEFA Nations League defeat to Israel in Haa, Armstrong was pleased toto Alex McLeish’s side, but unhappy with the outcome.He added: “It’s always nice to start games for Scotland. When you start games, you want to stay in there.“That is pleasing for me personally, but overall it was disappointing to come away with nothing from the game.”Armstrong felt there were some positives to be taken from Sunday’s display against a second-string Portuguese side at the National Stadium.He felt the Scots performed well in the first period before falling behind to Helder Costa’s goal just prior to half-time.In the second period, Eder added a second with a header from a free-kick and Bruma bagged the third after punishing Jack Hendry’s error in trying to play out from defence.Steven Naismith scored an injury-time consolation after latching on to Gary Mackay-Steven’s back-heel.Armstrong said: “I think the first half was really good in terms of our passing and moving.“We created some chances and controlled the game.“We were disappointed to let in a goal so close to half-time and that killed us a little bit.“The free-kick for the second goal was disappointing to concede so easily from a set-piece.“It didn’t feel like a - game to us. It felt like it was closer than that and looking at it overall, it was slightly improved from the disappointing result on Thursday.”Gothenburg Great McLeish’s squad changed between the Israel and Portugal games with Kieran Tierney, John Souttar, Robert Snodgrass and former Don Charlie Mulgrew dropping out.Aberdeen’s Mikey Devlin and Mackay-Steven came in along with former Don Ryan Christie.Armstrong can understand call-offs due to the congested nature of international breaks, but believes it’s important Scotland utilise the size of their squad.He said: “There’s not a lot of time to fit in the Nations League and friendly games during the international break.“They are always going to be tight and close together.“We have a big squad and it’s about using our squad for dferent games and improving.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/SNS-15348541-Rachel-Corsie-Scotland.jpg.jpg ","title":"from school to scotland internationals how it all began for north easts players","story":"Scotland#s women – with two north-east players at the heart of Shelley Kerr’s side – qualied for the World Cup in France next year.But how did Mintlaw maestro Kim Little and Aberdeen centre-back Rachel Corsie begin the footballing journeys which have taken them to the game’s pinnacle And what have they learned which they think could benefit the north-east teams and players as the game continues to develop For midfielder Little, now  and in a second spell with English Women’s Super League side Arsenal, getting started was relatively straightforward.Current team-mates tell her about being the only girl at their school who played, but Little, whose career has also taken her to the United States and Australia, was never short of opportunities.She said: “I always had very good opportunities where I was from. At school, playing with boys and girls, and obviously with the Buchan girls’ and women’s teams.“There was plenty of opportunity, which led into other things for me and developing a career out of it.“But for my generation, it wouldn’t have been a thought in most people’s minds that they could become a professional and make a living from it.”Little added: “I maybe had a dferent experience .“We had a lot of teachers who invested a lot of time in the school girls’ team and a lot of my friends played football.“I’ve spoken to other people about this and they say ‘we didn’t play, we didn’t have a team’ and they got into it through club football.“I played for Mintlaw Boys’ Club until I was  or maybe , and then played with Buchan Girls from  to the age of . We just played in local leagues and then obviously the Aberdeenshire leagues against Stonehaven, Aberdeen, Donside, then after that I moved down to Hibs ladies.“I’d train twice a week, but it was a lot of mums, dads, parents who took our training. Now it’s qualied coaches, and there’s more of a formal structure in place.”Scots skipper Corsie, , who was drawn to football by a Dons-daft mum and amateur side-coaching dad, is convinced, like Little, of the benefits of having to play with boys early on.She said: “It was mainly boys who played, soyou wanted to play that was the only option.“It’s still fair to say more boys than girls have that natural like for football, andyou want to play with the best people you have to play with them.“As you get older, physically they get stronger and faster, so playing with the boys helps get you into that top bracket with the girls.“I’m the same as Kim, super competitive, so when a boy is better than you, you don’t like it. If you commit to being as good it makes you better.“But there does come a time when they’re too strong and too physically good.”Defender Corsie, who trialled with Aberdeen and eventually played for them after years of club football with Stonehaven, thinks mixed games, which are still commonplace in younger age groups, should continue and help promote the women’s game.She said: “It helps influence perspectives. After we reached the World Cup, there were a number of boys I went to school with who reached out.“They still follow women’s football and acknowledge it, probably because they went to school with me.”Little says the majority of her elite-level team-mates played with boys until they were  or  – and she says this teaches girls the physical, controlled aggression side of the game.The Buchan native, who left Buchan for Hibs aged  before moving to the Gunners at , is Scotland’s current leading goalscorer, but her quality was evident early on. She was the first girl to win the Green Final skills trophy in  against a host of male peers.Her talent is always cited by her early coaches, but so is her work ethic.Little, who, with Corsie, featured for Scotland’s age group sides before becoming a full international, said: “I never thought about it too much back then, but when I look back my ability level was higher than most of the players.“I’d started playing for Scotland at youth age groups. In Edinburgh, Hibs were renowned for being one of the best teams in Scotland. They won Scottish Cups, national leagues, things like that.”She added: “In primary school you’d wait until after school and play every day. In secondary school you maybe do that a bit less, but I’d always go out and play with my dad and brother and continued to play a lot. I continued to play for the club team and school as well.“I get asked this a lot but I never felt like I was doing it for any reason. I just enjoyed it and didn’t do it because I thought I would make money from playing football.”Corsie was similarly unaware of her potential to turn professional, and her route to the top wasn’t as quick as Little’s.The player, who left Aberdeen Ladies for Glasgow City in  and is now on loan at Australia’s Canberra United from Utah Royals in the United States, said: “I don’t ever remember having huge ambitions to be a professional. I don’t knowI didn’t think I was good enough, or didn’t know the opportunity existed.“I studied accounting. I always knew I’d go to uni and it wasn’t until my early s I thought about going professional. That’s maybe a dferent story to a lot of the other girls.”Now capped more than  times for her country, it wasn’t until a short spell with English top-flight Notts County in  when Corsie was paid to play and could leave her job with Ernst and Young.Both Little and Corsie say the Scotland women’s squad discuss the state of the nation’s game when they get together.Little says despite the women’s game being professional where in the world – with some American players making millions – it’s still largely amateur in Scotland. She thinks this will need to be addressed to keep top players in the north-east and where.Aberdeen Ladies, the region’s only Premier League team, now have access to much better facilities, but Corsie thinks a talent drain which has always affected north-east women’s football is still a big problem.Both women agree next summer’s World Cup bow could be a game-changer for Scottish women’s football.Corsie said: “If something like that isn’t going to do it, it’s hard to know what will. If you start to do well, a lot of people will support that.“You always get the people who make scathing comments we’ve heard a million times before, but that’s what really accelerated the growth in England. At the last World Cup they got to the semi and finished third.“It pushed them on and put them miles ahead of where we are.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.There was some suspicion over the intentions of health and social care managers at the recent meeting of Mid Argyll Health and Care Forum .Members felt their recent behaviour might be a precursor to changing the forum set-up to make it saferand more homogenised across the region.But there was also strong feeling the HCF should be better attended by public representatives such as community councillors.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances.

In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year.

There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in.

In recent years, he has worked on national policing reform and been part of the Corporate Communications department. Before taking up his new post, he worked for the Scottish Multi-Agency Resilience, Training and Exercise Unit . Speaking to the Post, the chief inspector, declared: “Since I left school I had always wanted to join the police - with my traditional up bringing, I wanted to be part of the community. “As an operational officer, I have always worked in Ayrshire - when I first joined I started in the three towns, finished my probation and then moved to Millport as the local bobby. “It was an interesting but good experience - my family were young at the time - it was a Hamish MacBeth lestyle where I had the house that was built on to the police station. “What you learn at that point when you’re working yourself is in the winter you are working with your local community, but when you’re working throughout the summer time, you have the tourists - this is when the island community went from  upto , a day and you are still working yourself with the help of special constables. This is when you learn your people skills. I was there for three and a half years - you involve yourself with the community - it was just amazing. “It was a highlight for personal reasons, for family reasons, for friends you make for le and for the grounding it gives you in getting to know people. “I came back to Ayr in  as an operational police officer then I left the Division and worked in national security for a while which was really interesting. “It got to  and I wanted to come back to operational policing so I ed to Ayr as an operational inspector. “For the third time in my career, I’m back.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal. Alessandro Varese, owner of the Blue Lagoon chippy, believes a proposed outlet on High Street will open up a number of job opportunities for residents. Planning permission for the shop was granted last month, with the new -seat restaurant set to open sometime in the spring. The project represents a pound, investment for the city centre. Mr Varese told the PA: “Trespass is due to move out in February and that’s when we will get the keys. “It will take six weeks to fit the shop out so we are looking at an opening date of April . That’s what we are aiming for. “Between the property and the cost of the fit, we are talking about an investment or three-quarters of a million pounds, so it is a big project for us. “This is the furthest north we have been and we are looking at employing around - local people.” The Blue Lagoon already has both takeaways and restaurants in Glasgow, as well as in places like Ayr, Largs and Stirling. The business was set up by Mr Varese’s grandfather over  years ago. In recent years, their Glasgow chip shops have become a favourite with celebrities, with the likes of Justin Bieber and Nigella Lawson enjoying its food. Mr Varese said the Perth restaurant, which will cover  square feet, will promise something dferent. He said: “It will be similar in size to out Stirling restaurant but the shop itself will be a bit dferent. We are adopting a Blue Lagoon beach theme with sand and palm trees.” Planning chiefs said the plan would bring “vitality and viability” to Perth city centre.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPerthshirePerthshire NewsPerthPerth NewsFoodJustin BieberNigella LawsonGlasgowStirlingAyrLargs"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

Her story was powerfully told by her father, The Herald and Herald on Sunday writer-at-large Neil Mackay. Very few victims of sexual offences are able to share their perspective. Fewer still have the courage to do so under their own name.Caitie said she had identied a suspect to the police but that this man had never been interviewed. Why  Because, she was told, he would be unfit to understand the process. Last week, we suggested the man had mental health issues. In fact, we can now report, he has serious learning dficulties.She said the man was stalking her, turning up at her work, one of Glasgowrsquos biggest shopping malls. She did not feel safe. ldquoTrying to get any form of justice or protection is pointless, Caitie said. ldquoI feel aswhat happened to me simply does not matter. My faith in the police is destroyed.Last week, Mackay, profoundly worried about his daughter ndash and about the public interest issues he raised about the investigation of sex crimes ndash put a series of questions to the police. This week we can report how they responded.Officers spoken to by The Herald have great sympathy and respect for Mackay and his daughter. Their perspective on the investigation, is, however, in some details, is at odds with that of the Mackay family.So much so that some of their dferences may have to be resolved by a complaints process already under way thanks to formal interest from a politician following our story last week.Police, specically, say they carried out an extensive investigation in to Caitiersquos complaint ndash which is one of public indecency rather than ldquoa sexual assault, as we termed the offence in a headline last week.They also say there is ldquoinsufficient evidence to link the man with learning dficulties to the case.And they say they have no record of any report of stalking against the man. The Mackays dispute this and are understood to be considering their own formal complaint against the police.The officer in charge of investigating this case is Detective Superintendent Alwyn Bell. He leads Glasgow isionrsquos team of public protection detectives, specialists in sex crimes. It was his unit, he explained, which took over the case shortly after Caitie reported it.Bell said: ldquoFollowing a report of a man having indecently exposed himself near to Darnley train station on July , officers spoke to the victim and carried out a number of inquiries including a full search of the area.ldquoThe inquiry was then allocated to the dedicated Public Protection Unit within the ision, and following a CCTV check and other inquiries, there was no further information available at that time to identy a suspect. However, the inquiry remained open.Bell said that efforts had been made to keep the victim updated on this investigation by phone but added that ldquoofficers were unsuccessful. The detective, who has occupied senior public protection roles in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, also addressed ndash within serious legal limitations on what he can say ndash the concerns the Mackays had over the man identied by Caitie as her attacker.He said: ldquoOn July , the victim made a further call to police reporting that she had seen the suspect within her workplace. Officers attended to speak to her and the suspect was identied by the victim as being the inidual who had carried out the public indecency. ldquoInquiries were undertaken and, due to his behaviour, he was ed home to his parents. Officers then obtained medical advice regarding the suspectrsquos condition and it was made clear by a medical professional that he has signicant learning dficulties, and therefore lacks the capacity to understand a police interview or the ramications of his actions or conduct.The man is on Police Scotlandrsquos vulnerable persons database or VPD. He has been the subject of some inquiries. However, the force, in a formal statement to The Herald on Sunday, said they currently do not have a positive line of inquiry in the case.Bell added: ldquoThe inquiry into this incident remains open and we would ask anyone who has any information which may assist, to contact us.The story centres on some of the trickiest and most sensitive areas of police work: updating victims on live investigations and handling inquiries which touch on vulnerable people.There can be legal, ethical and practical reasons why officers cannot share the full story of any live inquiry to complex, messy, human crimes with journalists, the relatives of adult victims and victims themselves. There can also be miscommunications and misunderstandings between police and those whose lives are affected by crime and its investigation.The circumstances of this case now look likely to be settled by a formal independent process of complaints.Police Scotland has faced complaints about such issues before, including those which have been upheld and those which have not been. Each such complaint, say insiders, offers a chance to learn lessons or get to the bottom of a dispute.The force in recent years has also increasingly secured the trust of organisations which support victims of sex crimes. Whatever the outcome of formal concerns about the Mackay case, the force will be eager to rebuild trust among victims and their families. Dfering perspectives on the course of the investigation aside, insiders stress they see Caitie as a good faith witness.Senior officers in recent years have put huge public emphasis on a message that they want to hear reports of sexual offences. Last financial year they recorded nearly , such crimes, more than double the historic norm. Numbers continue to rise this year, early reports suggest. In -, there were  cases of public indecency, the kind of offence experienced by Caitie.Somebody, police are sure, put Caitie through a terrying ordeal on July . That somebody has not been caught. There have not been any reports of similar crimes in the area. However, the man who tormented Caitie may well have exposed himself to others. If you were one of those women, or have any information about who the man might be, contact Police Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-to-unveil-common-sense-brexit-plans","story":"The publication, due out on Monday, will reinforce the case for continued membership of the single market and customs union, Scotlands First Minister said.It will also argue that the UK Governments \" choice\" between a \"bad, possibly blindfold\" Brexit deal and a no-deal scenario should not be accepted.The release of the paper will come as the First Minister gives a speech at the Royal Society of Artsin London on Monday.Speaking in advance of the address, Ms Sturgeon said: \"The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union less than six months from now -

A major report from the UN intergovernmental  on climate change concluded that by  temperatures are on course to rise . degrees above pre-industrial levels, the maximum increase before catastrophic consequences ndash extreme floods and heat, mass displacement and poverty ndash are unleashed upon the planet.Wow. Twelve years.

Or the ldquoIrsquom sure scientists will sort it place.Climate change is a million times more important than these issues, of course, and I find it fascinating that most of us didnrsquot collapse into a heap of anguish when we discovered the findings of this latest report. Despite how far we have evolved psychologically over the centuries, our ability to ignore serious issues because we donrsquot like the solutions remains remarkably strong.Living less mobile and connected lives, drastically reducing or giving up the conveniences that define our age ndash the dirty, gas-guzzling cars, the power-hungry gadgets, the cheap air travel, meat-heavy foods that fill our diets, the non-recyclable plastic ndash seems awful and impossible, so we ignore the whole thing.Even those of us already suffering the consequences of environmental destruction ndash those with breathing dficulties, for example ndash struggle to change their own behaviour because our brains are pre-conditioned to focus primarily on the short-term, and probably for very good reason.Human psychology has not evolved to point where it can handle the enormity of a challenge on this scale, evenscience can provide many of the intellectual and theoretical solutions. In other words, our tiny minds doom us to failure.And I include politicians in this ldquoour. Governments clearly have a very signicant role in making us change our behaviourthere is to be any hope of averting disaster.

In doing so, he discovers new insights into how decisions were made about land far from Edinburgh and London.HIGHER LEARNINGMore than  years ago, the last Conservative Secretary of State to rule Scotland before devolution made one of the most important announcements about the future of the Highlands and Islands. The region, Michael Forsyth, said would get its own university. No longer would all students have to go south to learn after school.Mr Forsyth was speaking at a  meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee of MPs in Inverness. But he was not,- Mr Ross has discovered, saying things that Scotlandrsquos senior civil servants and all its established universities wanted to hear.Mr Ross wrote: ldquoI received a phone call from a Scottish Office civil servant after the meeting askingI had notes of what exactly Mr Forsyth had said onthe subject, as he and his colleagueshad no detail.ldquoWe later learnt Mr Forsyth had asked an opposition MP to ask a question about the university.For his book, Mr Ross went back to Mr Forsyth, now Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. ldquoOn the University of the Highlands and Islands, I just couldnrsquot get anywhere. The universities were all lobbying against it, the officials were against it. I could just see the whole thing disappearing into a three-year review. I thought we will just announce we are doing it, then they will have to get on with it. So thatrsquos what I did.David Ross on his Herald beatNow the institution has  colleges, with more than  local learning centres and thousands of students. The old Scottish Office as recently as  had described a campaign for a Highland university as ldquopremature and prejudicial.BRAVEHEART, CULLODEN AND THE TORIESHe was the Scottish secretary who ed the Stone of Destiny to Edinburgh. But, Mr Ross reveals, Lord Forsyth had another huge fight with civil servants over how to remember the last great battle on British soil and one of events which defined the Highlands of today: Culloden.In Highland Herald, Mr Ross describes how the then Mr Forsyth wanted to commemorate the battlersquos th anniversary in  as part of a civil war. But, the politician told Mr Ross, officials were ldquodesperate to keep it as low key as possible, because they thought it was sensitive.Lord Forsyth added: ldquoAnd I had to cope with the film Braveheart as well. It became apparent that people confused the Wars of Scottish Independence in the th Century with Culloden in the th Century, and had no understanding as to what this was all about.Mel GibsonThis was the era of high polling for Scottish independence and even higher support for a new parliament in Edinburgh, a body that was to materialise three years later.THE LAND QUESTIONConservatives may have been seen as the party of the lairds but Lord Forsyth told Mr Ross a dferent story. ldquoWe have had some horrendous examples of horrible landlords, he said, ldquomainly from outside Scotland.Community buy-outs became one of the biggest stories Mr Ross told about the Highlands over  years. In his book, he hears from a senior official that development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprisehad been initially dubious about supporting the Assynt Croftersrsquo historic and ultimately successful campaign to win their land  years ago.Andrew Thin, who was Chief Executive of Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise and today is Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission, recalls the early HIE approach was: ldquoQuiet moral support behind the scenes perhaps, but not a suitable use of public funds.However, an article in The Daily , he had been told, heralded an instruction from a high level in Whitehall that Assynt was exactly the sort of demonstration of local initiative and enterprise that should be supported. HIErsquos attitude changed thereafter and the agency in the end contributed pound,, as well as giving the Assynt Crofters advice and encouragement.Other communities, such as Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha followed. Now well over , acres are under community ownershipTHE CLEARANCES CONTROVERSIESThe Assynt crofters drive to take back their land reflected generations of hurt over who owns Scotland - and the Clearances of the poor, often Gaelic-speaking, from the Highlands in the centuries after Culloden.This year the historian Sir Tom Devine has revisited the issue and claried that the Clearances were far from just a Highland issue, taking issue with the traditional take of popular historian John Prebble, who Mr Ross knew.John PrebbleIn Highland Herald, Mr Ross looks at the legacy of Mr Prebble, whose work was once dismissed by a late historiographer royal as ldquoutter rubbish.Mr Ross said: ldquoWhether or not the Highlands and Islands suffered worse depopulation numerically compared to other parts of Scotland, I have never felt was the most important issue. Rather it was the impact on the people, which Sorley MacLean described as the ldquophenomenon of phenomena.Mr MacLean was Mr Rossrsquos father-in-law and his book includes praise to the late bard which Mr Ross says he would have found ldquoexcruciating.TONGUE LASHINGMr Ross back in  came in for a not always gentle Fleet Street ribbing when he was covering the manhunt for a -year-old girl and her -year-old boyfriend. He spotted the pair near Tongue but called the police rather than try to get a scoop and speak to them.In his book, the reporter explains that ethical rules of his trade meant he could not interview a child without a responsible adult present.

Indeed, I would argue that no self-respecting Parliament would fall for it, she declared.In a speech to the Royal Society of Arts, the social change think-tank, in London, Ms Sturgeon complained that the Conservative Government had shown ldquolittle inclination to pay heed to Scotland during the Brexit process.ldquoOne of the lessons from our experience of the last two years, which I suspect has not been lost on the Scottish people and which will be remembered in Scotland for a long time to come, is the stark contrast between the EUrsquos treatment of independent nations and the UKrsquos treatment of devolved nations.Claiming the UK had ldquodismissed and ignored Scotlandrsquos concerns, the FM noted: ldquoLooking at the UK and the EU, it is fair to say that only one has looked like a genuine partnership of equals and that has not been the UK.Ms Sturgeon stressed how her Government had made a ldquobig compromise by dropping its demand that Scotland remain in the EU and pledged it to exhausting all the ldquoopportunities for compromise, holding out hope that a sensible outcome could be achieved. However, she made clear Scotland staying in the customs union and single market was Edinburghrsquos ldquobottom line.She pointed out thatthere were a special carve-out on the single market for Northern Ireland, then Scotland should be next in line for a ldquodferentiated approach.The FM only fleetingly mentioned the option of a second independence referendum, saying howno compromise could be reached, then Scotland ldquomust have the option to choose a dferent course ie independence.In a question and answer session following her speech, she claimed the ldquocase for democratic independence since  has strengthened immeasurably, noting how in the referendum campaign it was argued a Yes vote would result in Scotland leaving the EU.ldquoThat brings into sharp focus the democratic deficit Scotland has experienced on many occasions, which on this issue it has felt particularly harshly, she said.The Nationalist leader dismissed the Prime Ministerrsquos compromise blueprint as ldquoimpracticable, undesirable and undeliverable, stressing that whatever proposalMPs might finally vote on, it would not be the Chequers Plan.She noted how the EU was bitterly opposed to Chequers becauseit would undermine the unity of the single market, dealing only with goods and not services. Plus, there was no Westminstermajority for it.Ms Sturgeon rebuffed Mrs Mayrsquos claim that it was the only option on the table this was so, the FM pointed out, because the PM refused to countenance any other.ldquoLetrsquos be clear, she declared, ldquoa head-in-the-sand approach wonrsquot make the Chequers ostrich fly.The SNP leaderinsisted that neither a fudged Brexit deal not a ldquoblindfold Brexit ie a vague political statement of intent about the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU, would do. A blindfold Brexit would ldquoreplace a no-deal Brexit with a no-detail Brexit, she said.ldquoVoting against a bad or a blindfold Brexit deal isnrsquot a vote for no-deal it would be a vote for a better deal, insisted Ms Sturgeon.The FM accused the Conservative Government of taking an ldquoextreme interpretation of the  referendum result, which, she argued, was not a mandate for a hard Brexit and that the ldquoobvious democratic compromise was for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union.Indeed, Ms Sturgeon went on to say that her preferred option ldquomight well be the only option which is not completely impossible.She explained: ldquoIt should be acceptable to the EU. It avoids the worst economic damage that Brexit will wreak. It resolves the Irish border issue and it comes closest to reconciling the dfering views of Leavers and Remainers. And while it is an outcome, which still looks some distance away, it is not unachievable.The FM called for a genuine attempt to find common ground, stressing how the Scottish Government had shown its willingness to compromise, ldquoit is time the UK Government did likewise.In response, aspokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \"We will have an ambitious course outside of the EU that enhances our prosperity and security and that genuinely works for everyone across the UK.\"We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU and look forward to continuing to engage with the EU Commission on our proposals.\"Adam Tomkins, theScottish Conservative Constitution spokesman,said there was \"nothing new\" in Ms Sturgeons speech, which had been made \"in the hope of drumming up the prospects for Scottish independence\".He added: \"If the SNP doesnt back a deal, it is automatically supporting a no-deal scenariosomething the Nationalists have admitted would be bad for Scotland.\"And, of course, they dont careoutcomes are bad for Scotland, so long as theyre good for the prospects of another independence referendum.\"Labours Ian Murray, who co-chairs Scottish Labour for the Single Market, said:ldquoThere is no such thing as a good Brexitand the First Minister is right to state that UK membership of the single market and the customs union is the least-worst option for our economy.ldquoGiven the problems with solving the border issue in Ireland, this is the only practical solution. It will also safeguard up to , jobs in Scotland.ldquoHowever, the SNP must not use the Brexit chaos to pursue its dream of breaking-up Britain. Nicola Sturgeons suggestion of a dferential deal for Scotland would move the Northern Irish problem to the border between Scotland and England.

The SNPs own Growth Commission admits that independence means years of cuts to public services.\"Pamela Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, added: ldquoThe nationalist movement will never stop campaigning for a second independence referendum, even though the majority of people in Scotland want to move on from the isions of the past.

As well as offering a home for nature, bogs play a key role in water quality and flow and in a healthy state, peat is an essential weapon in the fight against climate change, acting as a massive sink for greenhouse gases.But when damaged they can release huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Now a further , hectares of damaged peatlands are starting on the road to recovery after the pound million in extra funding from the Scottish Government for the national Peatland Action scheme.It will be spent on conservation measures including landscaping to reduce exposed peat and the installation of peat dams to restore water levels in blanket bogs, which are vital to carbon capture and provide habitats for many important Scottish species.Work will involve blocking gullies to prevent the earth from drying out and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.Eroded areas of bare peat will also be re-planted to stabilise the surface.These measures will improve mountain vegetation, which will in turn benefit native wildle and birds such as the snipe, skylark and greenshank.Andrew McBride, Project Manager of the Peatland ACTION project said: ldquoPeat covers over % of Scotlandrsquos land area and it is estimated that over % of this is in a degraded condition.\"The SNH Peatland ACTION team works with land managers across Scotland and in partnership with other organisations to restore degraded peatlands ndash to date we have started the process of restoration on nearly ,ha of peatlands.\"Most of our work involves advising on ditch blocking, stabilising eroded areas, and re-establishing vegetation ndash most notably by the bog building plant sphagnum moss.ldquoNot only are peatlands part of our landscape and cultural heritage, providing a unique habitat for species such as large heath butterflies and sundew plants, they are important for our environment. Peat stores carbon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\"Peatbogs retain and filter water, reducing the impact of drought or flooding and keeping our burns clean for fishing and drinking.Across the world, large-scale degradation is causing serious environmental and social impact, with annual emissions estimated at around two gigatonnes of carbon dioxide -  per cent of all global emissions.Rewetting damaged peatlands can bring them back to good condition.Scots are being urged to avoid using peat-based compost in their gardens to help preserve resources.Conservationists say the current reliance on the ancient material for growing certain plants is \"totally unacceptable and unsustainable\", and people should turn to alternatives that are just as effective and readily available.Nearly a quarter of Scotlands entire land area - around two million hectares - is made up of peat bogs, which are estimated to contain around , million tonnes of carbon.The habitat also plays a crucial role in helping guard against flooding, purying water and supporting rare native wildle such as adders, golden plovers, dragonflies and carnivorous sundew plants.Extraction of peat destroys peatlands, which take thousands of years to form - laying down just mm per year. Some of Scotlands mires began forming in the Bronze age.The UK government has committed to abolishing the use of peat in amateur gardening by  and ending extraction of peat for the horticulture industry by .However, despite a signicant rise in uptake of alternative composts, peat use by gardeners has also been increasing.Industry figures show more than half of material used in bagged composts is peat, amounting to two million cubic metres every year.Around a third of all peat used for gardening in the UK comes from bogs in this country, while the remainder comes from Ireland and where in Europe.Conservation charity Plantle, which owns Munsary nature reserve in the internationally recognised Flow Country in Caithness - one of Europes most extensive areas of peatland - is working with organisations such as the Royal Horticultural Society, the Scottish Wildle Trust and the National Trust for Scotland to end use of peat in gardening and revitalise peatlands.Plantles Dr Trevor Dines said: \"For the love of peat, the time to wean ourselves off this precious, threatened natural resource is now.\"Our use of peat is simply unsustainable, hugely damaging to our peatlands - some of our best natural treasures - and simply not relevant in todays climate.\"We all have the opportunity to do the right thing by our gardens and countryside and demand a peat-free future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-power-to-use-100-wind-power-after-selling-off-last-coal-and-gas-stations","story":"The Spanish-owned giant has become the first major UK energy supplier to refocus entirely on renewable sources such as wind and solar.Its move comes a week after the International Panel on Climate Changewarned the world was \"off track\" in efforts to limit environmentally catastrophic global warming.IPCC scientists warned \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" were required.Scottish Power on Tuesday said it had sold its remaining conventional electricity generation business to a subsidiary of Drax Group for poundm.And it said it would invest pound.bn in UK to more than double existing  gigawatt capacity for renewable energy over the next four years.Ignacio Galaacuten, Chairman and Chief Executive of Iberdrola, Scottish Powers parent, said: \"Energy companies must be part of the solution to climate change.\"Iberdrola is acting now to cut carbon emissions  per cent by  and be carbon neutral by .

Jointly, they are urging all NHS Trusts and Boards to improve bereavement care for parents across the UK.The call comes during Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from October  to October .The week also marks the roll-out of the National Bereavement Care Pathway , a partnership between the charities, governments and the NHS.The pathway sets out standards for providing excellent care to anyone affected by pregnancy and baby loss.This year is also Sands’ th anniversary, providing support to parents who have suffered a bereavement.While there have been many improvements since , unfortunately, inconsistencies still remain across the UK.Marc Harder, the NBCP project lead for Sands, said: “Standards of care across the country right now are very much inconsistent.“We want those in power to ensure that bereaved parents get the best possible care, wherever they live and wherever they present themselves – whether that be AE, a maternity unit or early pregnancy unit.“Sadly, health care professionals don’t always have the training they need to speak to bereaved parents.“In an audit we carried out last year, only  per cent of Trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement training.“And of those  per cent,  per cent of them only provided their staff with one hour or less of bereavement training each year.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local politicians have responded to Kirkcaldy Foodbanks urgent plea for help.

Marc added: “In the next  months, we have the opportunity to really make a dference in Scotland.“We have come a long, long way since  but we’ve still got a way to go.“We long for a world in which there is no baby loss. “Until then we’ll continue to work to ensure parents receive the best possible care they can during their bereavement journey.”Scottish Government funding lays pathway to improvementsIn April this year, the National Bereavement Care Pathwayfor pregnancy and baby loss was extended to Scotland, thanks to £, in funding from the Scottish Government. Sands is working with the Scottish Government, a number of baby loss charities and other health care partners in Scotland to develop the approach over the next two years, with the plan to pilot, implement and embed the NBCP across Scotland by March .Five experiences of pregnancy or baby loss are included in the NBCP including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death and the sudden unexpected death of an infant up to the age of  months.Health Secretary Shona Robison said: “The funding will allow implementation of the National Bereavement Care Pathway in pilot sites across Scotland and ensure all bereaved parents are offered high quality, sensitive bereavement care.”The development of the NBCP in Scotland is being overseen by a Scottish steering group.Kate Mulley, director of research, education and policy at Sands, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support of the Scottish Government and Sands support groups in Scotland who have contributed to the funding of this vital project which will make such a dference to so many families.” Forty years ago, two bereaved mothers, Bel Mooney and Hazelanne Lewis, found there was no support available. So they founded Sands in .At that time, most parents were not allowed to see, hold or bury their babies and they could not put their babies’ names on the stillbirth certicate.Sands is now the leading stillbirth and neonatal death charity in the UK. It works to reduce baby deaths through promoting better maternity care and funding research. The charity offers training and comprehensive bereavement support, both nationally through its helpline –    or via email at helpline@sands.org.uk – and locally via some  regional support groups.Further information can be found at www.sands.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie makes most beautiful shortlist","story":"Inverurie has been shortlisted for Scotland#s Most Beautul High Street competition run by Scotland#s Towns Partnership , Keep Scotland Beautul, and the Herald on Sunday.The STP seeks to celebrate towns, cities and villages that take pride in where they live, and highlight the groups who come together and work to change their communities for the better: making local places clean, attractive, accessible, sustainable, vibrant and inclusive for all to enjoy.Entries will be judged on factors including horticultural achievement, public realm, environmental responsibility, community participation and accessibility and inclusivity.Inverurie Environmental ImprovementGroup chairman, John Glover, said: “IEI is delighted that Inverurie Town Centre has been shortlisted for Scotland’s Most Beautul High Street.\"The Town Centre has looked exceptionally well with the floral displays this year.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, creating this blueprint for the town will help the council and community work together to achieve as much as we can.”The council is now working to help community groups to find external grant funding to bring forward their ideas.To read the full document and for updates visitwww.yourkirkwall and the Your Kirkwall Facebook and Twitter feeds.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption.

I see a bright future for the town, now things are starting to move forward,\" she said.This was echoed by long-serving Invergordon hairdresser Sharon Mitchell. She agreed more houses were desperately needed but said more shops must follow because the town centre was sorely lacking its yesteryear \"buzz\".\"It used to be thriving here but itrsquos Alness thatrsquos thriving now. If theyrsquore going to be building more houses we need more shops.\"The celebrated land deal cost pound,.The council said this was funded through grants from the Scottish Government.A spokeswoman said no decision had been taken as to the timescale for development or of the mix of tenure for the land, which is identied within the Inner Moray Firth Development Plan as having capacity for  homes,She said it is likely that the development will include housing for mid-market rent and shared equity as well as housing for social rent by the council or Albyn Housing Society.Ms Mitchell, who has been running Sharonrsquos Unisex Hair Studio on King Street for more than  years, said the council should make the homes available for purchase under a LIFT Scheme, known otherwise as a Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers.Under this shared equity scheme, of which there are two dferent models, the Scottish Government is this year providing pound million to help people buy a home, within certain price thresholds, for sale on the open market. It also can help people buy a new-build home from a council or housing association.Ms Mitchell said: \"A LIFT scheme would be the best. The majority of my younger clients are saying theyrsquore still staying at home with their mums and dads and trying to save and getting nowhere.\"Or a few friends have clubbed together and are renting a place because they canrsquot afford to live on their own.\"Cllr Smith, who has been campaigning for new homes for Invergordon, is overjoyed with the move.She said people want to live and rent social housing in Invergordon, but some also want to buy privately.\"To this end I managed to include two new housing sites in the Inner Moray Firth Local Plan a few years ago. These were the northern end of the Cromlet site, opposite the rugby club and the farmland at Davidson Drive, surrounding the farm buildings.\"Both landowners were approached and the latter is under discussion.\"She added: \"Invergordon has so much to offer in terms of employment, both atthe base and industrial estates, as well as the cruise sector, which is growing, but people need a decent roof over their heads.\"By encouraging inward-migration and moving around within the town we also encourage the economics to grow, so more people means more people in the town shopping and more new shopping ideas popping up as there would be people to use them.\"In latter years, Invergordonrsquos population has settled around the  mark, whereas Alness has grown to just over .\"It is time this balanced-out and allowed both towns to be more equal in terms of shopping experiences.\"Tuesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.

Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed.

Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"11 greenwell gott ","story":"Offers over £,This exclusive development comprises thirteen houses grouped around a large communal park which provides a great play area for children being on a no-through road.

However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/STROMEFERRY-ROAD-TO-RAIL-4.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church. Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland.

I was booked into try their Interstellar Relaxation Experience with the package tailored to leave the senses ‘other worldly’.A warm welcome was extended at the spa entrance as my battered Converse were taken away to be swtly replaced with a cosy pair of slippers. After changing I met with my therapist for the afternoon, Leanne, who explained that the experience would entail a pressure point foot massage, hot stone back, neck and shoulder massage, regenerating jasmine infused facial with warming Space Mask and to finish a chance to sip over a glass of flora jasmine tea.Having an almost -month- year-old son, bag, baggage, pram, and the everyday ‘essentials’ to cover that role, my back and shoulders were in dire need of a serious overhaul and I was more than happy to let Leanne knead, massage and crack away at the numerous knots accumulated over the past two years.Having chose a detoxying body oil for the duration of the treatment, Leanne explained that the ingredients would still be working their magic  hours after, so Monday could be faced head on. Combining the very finest in the Spa’s renowned ESPA range, Leanne used the Optimal Skin Procleanser which acts as a cleaner, exfoliator and mask for visibly radiant skin, hydrating cleansing milk and from their age-defying range – which I was all for – the Tri-Active Advanced Instant Facial with the Regenerating Face Treatment Oil and Lt and Firm Mask. The treatment was further complimented with a pressure point foot massage and application of the very latest in beauty utopia, the self heating Spacemask, which works to relieve tiredness, eye strain and many other ‘earthly tensions’.ESPA’s Pink Hair and Scalp Mask was then applied to enhance the Tibetan scalp massage. By this stage I was wondering how I was going to get off the bed such was my relaxed state and as Leanne handed me a glass of flora jasmine and rose tea I felt completely chilled.The chance to enjoy the spa facilities – not too mention the spectacular scenery – is another added bonus of the treatment and helps to suspend the fact you have toto reality before the end of the day.We are all guilty of not making enough time for ourselves in modern society with many of us trying and in many cases failing to find the right mix of work le balance. The Spa at Slieve Donard’s staff, therapists and especially their autumn Interstellar package ensure that those who partake, their minds and bodies are transported to a better place – for a few hours at least. The Interstellar Relaxation autumn day spa experience runs until November . The treatment is priced at £ Monday-Friday at the Culloden Spa or £ at the Slieve Donard Spa. A £ supplement applies for Saturday and Sundays at both Spas.

We are all doing our jobs and we are trying to get the best deal for this country, and that’s it.“We are approaching the end of negotiations.

It remains unclear whether this will be framed as a final opportunity to reach agreement or as a chance for the  to make preparations for a disorderly no-deal withdrawal.Belgium’s foreign minister, Didier Reynders, put the chances of the UK crashing out without a deal at “ ”.“There is a need for some good compromise that should be made,” he said.“I understand the British Government has its dficulties, but I also believe that the EU is united at , and this is in our interest to preserve union first.”Mr Reynders added: “Evenin this week’s debate we are not going to have any kind of deal, there is still time, there is still possibility to get a deal.”The Prime Minister told the House of Commons on Monday that an exit agreement is still “achievable”.And European Council president Donald Tusk urged both sides to keep making every effort to find a deal.“There is something of a grisly job to be done here,” former Brexit minister Steve Baker says cabinet ministers “need to change the prime minister’s mind on where she is going”.@SteveBakerHW | @MarkUrban | #newsnight pic kWTCKgDEi— BBC NewsnightOctober , In a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, Mr Tusk said the Brexit negotiations had “proven to be more complicated than some may have expected”.But he added: “We should nevertheless remain hopeful and determined, as there is good will to continue these talks on both sides.”The fact that both sides have now begun preparations for a no-deal Brexit “must not, under any circumstances, lead us away from making every effort to reach the best agreement possible”, he said.“As someone rightly said: ‘It always seems impossible until it’s done’. Let us not give up.”Former Brexit minister Steve Baker told BBC Two’s Newsnight the Cabinet needs to “change the Prime Minister’s mind” on her plans or they will be rejected.Former Conservative leader Lord Hague suggested Mrs May should consider seeking temporary membership of the European Free Trade Association after withdrawal to allow time for a free trade agreement to be negotiated.There is “no disgrace in doing some fresh thinking”, Lord Hague told the Daily .“As an alternative to chaos it could command wide support.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin wants the UK’s withdrawal next March to be orderly “but not at any price”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested a deal may be delayed as late as December.But Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP, which props up Mrs May’s minority administration in the Commons, said a no-deal outcome was now “probably inevitable” due to the “intransigence” of EU negotiators."},{"url":null,"title":"a 150k family home up for grabs for price of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy. He said it will also be a pleasure for the local authorityrsquos leisure staff to move to a modern building.The senior council official said everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially, deserve credit for the part they played..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down High pupils make waves at RYA  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos sailors took to the water at the weekend with over  others to battle it out at the RYA Northern Ireland Youth Championships and Schools Cup at Cultra.The sailors from the Downpatrick school battled hard in tough conditions, with a special mention to going to Adam Fermor, sailing in the Laser Standard fleet, who made a clean sweep, with five first place podium finished from five races.Evie Mclaughlin also performed impressively, finishing as third lady overall, in the Laser Radial Fleet.

Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said. Balance and technique are important.ldquoAnother important area is maintenance.

Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take. Each Round Table has received tickets on which you can guess the mileage on the car when the journey ends.Fty pence is the price per guess and the winner will receive pound. In this way, the Round Table hope to raise in excess of pound, for their selected charity.

The winning ticket will be announced at lunch on Sunday.DOWNPATRICK mdash Window-smashing, ransacking vandals left their trademark on yet another school last week when they broke into St Patrickrsquos Boysrsquo Primary School in Downpatrick.The St Dillonrsquos Avenue school was badly vandalised with the tuck shop destroyed, windows and door  smashed and ious types of equipment wrecked.The latest incident happened last Wednesday night and came less than a week after police had been allied to see the extent of the damage caused by vandals at the nearby St Maryrsquos Secondary School on the Ardglass Road.On that occasion pictures and statues were knocked off walls and broken and several other items, including doors, were badly damaged. Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

DUP leader Arlene Foster is given a tour ofSt Patricks Cathedral in Dublin by Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Bishop of Glendalough, Michael Jackson. Pic by Niall Carson PA Wire But Mrs Foster stressed that she would oppose any proposal which leads to Northern Ireland “slavishly following EU rules whilst all the time erging away from the rest of the United Kingdom”.She said it was not just unionists in NI who were determined to fend off the EU’s mooted backstop plan, highlighting Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson’s opposition to any move that would place a border in the Irish Sea.Mrs Foster’s comments came as Theresa May insisted that a Brexit deal is still “achievable”, despite deadlock in negotiations over the thorny issue of the backstop.But hours after the prime minister’s statement to the Commons, European Council President Donald Tusk warned that the UK is “more likely than ever before” to crash out of the EU without a deal.While he felt there was good will on both sides, Mr Tusk said the negotiations have been more complicated than expected.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds called on Mrs May to hold to her pledge that NI will not be “carved off” from the rest of the UK by a customs or regulatory border post-Brexit.The PM vowed that the UK would leave the EU together, but said a deal which allowed NI to export freely to both Great Britain and the EU would be beneficial to business.Meanwhile, Leave campaigner Nigel Farage said the issue of the NI border has been used by Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier to “trap” the PM into keeping the UK in a customs union.Brexit: Nigel Dodds presses Theresa May on ‘no Irish Sea border’ pledge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

He knew myself and my friends and was a really friendly man.\"He always used to know what ice lollies we would each have, see us crossing over and put them on the counter ready.\"Mr Pontis suffered a stroke after falling in his garden in spring , and later had three small heart attacks and three bouts of pneumonia.He pulled through each time, but caught pneumonia for a fourth time and died on Friday September .His funeral was held at St Peterrsquos Church in Cardf on Tuesday October , before he was buried at Thornhill Cemetery.Ms Sakke called the service was ldquolovely.ldquoThe priest who led the service had lived in Rome and so did some of it in Italian, she added. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight. By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
