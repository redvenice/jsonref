Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Their new HBO show will premiere on August 28 LeBron James and lifelong friend Maverick Carter\u0027s barbershop-style talk show, \u0027The Shop,\u0027 is moving to HBO.James, who recently relocated to Los Angeles by signing a four-year, $154 million contract with the Lakers, had been doing the program on his website, The Uninterrupted. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, HBO has ordered a \u0027handful\u0027 of episodes, which began shooting in Los Angeles at West Hollywood\u0027s Barber Surgeons Guild last week.The show will premiere on HBO at 11pm on August 28.In one part of the preview, James can seen discussing the stress of parenthood: specifically watching his sons follow in his hardwood footstep. He also admitted to being an overly-competitive parent.  \u0027I didn\u0027t get into an argument with an AAU dad,\u0027 James said when talking about seeing his son, LeBron Jr., play youth basketball. \u0027I got into an argument with an AAU mom.\u0027James also confessed that he regretted giving his oldest son the \u0027Jr.\u0027 moniker, and gave a little window into his reasoning: \u0027When I was younger, obviously I didn\u0027t have a dad, my whole thing was when I have a kid, not only is he going to be a Jr. I\u0027m gonna do everything that this man didn\u0027t do.\u0027SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO            James (right) and New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (left) on the set of The Shop  All hail The King! LeBron James is greeted with a standing...\u0027Never touch religion, politics or anyone against Kobe\u0027:...Share this article\u0027When I was a kid, being in barbershops meant listening to adults talk about sports, clothing, politics, music, everything happened in the shop,\u0027 James continued. \u0027It was so real and so candid no one had a sense of, Well, I can\u0027t be myself here. That\u0027s how The Shop became an idea.\u0027It\u0027s not yet clear how many episodes HBO will broadcast, or if James will appear throughout the series.          Snoop Dogg, a native of Southern California, will welcome James to the neighborhood on HBO  WNBA superstar Candace Parker (left) and Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett (right) will also appear in the early episodes of The Shop on HBO, which premieres in August           Jon Stewart asked  James how he deals with watching his children follow in his footsteps According to THR, James will appear in at least the first three episodes.Of course, James\u0027s availability next year will be determined by how far he and his new Lakers teammates get into the Western Conference Playoffs.\u0027We\u0027ll do it as frequently as the conversation warrants,\u0027 says Peter Nelson, executive vice president of HBO Sports. \u0027It\u0027s LeBron\u0027s baby, so he very much wants to do it. And he wants to do it as much as possible.\u0027          Another former Giants wide receiver, Victor Cruz, also made an appearance in the HBO trailer for the new show, \u0027The Shop\u0027 James\u0027s SpringHill Entertainment has several projects underway with HBO, including a multi-part documentary on Muhammad Ali, and something about student athletes, which will premiere on October 2 and focus on the NCAA\u0027s controversial rules regarding amateurism.The Shop gives the boxing-centric HBO Sports another avenue to reach new audiences.\u0027Sports for us is really about a lens into socioeconomic, political, cultural issues and ideas around virtuosity in competition,\u0027 says Nelson.\u0027The objective,\u0027 Nelson continued, \u0027is candor. On the one hand, the barbershop as a place historically of secular communion, and on the other hand of the athletes and artist who have achieved this certain level of excellence who want to get in a room and a setting to talk like that with each other because a dearth of forms like that where they can really feel porous and honest with one other. And so it\u0027s less about let\u0027s leverage these names and these relationships and can we get this person or that person. It\u0027s more about who has something to say.\u0027          James has appeared in the last eight NBA Finals as a member of the Cavaliers and the Miami Heat, but lost in three of the previous four meetings with Stephen Curry and the Warriors "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/03/4E9AF13C00000578-5997935-image-m-9_1532660359488.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr says ABC broke contract firing 24 hours tweet","story":"    Roseanne Barr claims ABC broke her contract which guaranteed her \u002724 hours to correct any mistakes\u0027, in an interview with Sean Hannity on Thursday evening           Barr sat down with the Fox News host for her first interview appearance following her racist tweet and the axing of her show\u0027s reboot           She said: \u0027I want to tell you this.

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Meghan and her husband Prince Harry already have their own apartment, Nottingham Cottage, in Kensington Palace and York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate.And the Queen has also given the newly-married couple Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Castle as a wedding gift.The cottage was built in 1831, but its most famous resident was Group Captain Peter Townsend, who famously had an affair with Princess Margaret.The bedtime protocol is not the only thing the new Duchess of Sussex will have to adjust to.Along with not being able to eat certain foods in certain places, including her favourites at Buckingham Palace, it is unlikely that Royal fans will see Meghan with dark nail polish or a dress that exposes her knees, both things reportedly disliked by the Queen.It is also highly unlikely that one will see Meghan in wedges anytime she is near Her Majesty, given the monarch is famously not a fan of them. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Doubts cast on August rate rise after inflation holds steadyWage growth (excluding bonuses) slowed to 2.7 per cent while the figure including bonuses remained stuck at 2.5 per cent in the three months to May, according to the latest figures by the Office of National Statistics.However, the economy is predicted to have grown by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter, up from 0.2 per cent between January and March.History of the Bank of England base rate                                                    Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics said: \u0027The Monetary Policy Committee held off raising rates in May because it wanted to see evidence that the weak patch in economic activity at the start of the year was just a blip.\u0027The official data and business surveys released since then suggests that growth did indeed recover in Q2. \u0027With little slack left in the labour market, robust growth is likely to lead to a further increase in wage inflation.\u0027Alongside the MPC\u0027s ambition to return interest rates to a level from which they can be cut to help in the next downturn, we think that provides reason enough for the MPC to raise interest rates in August.\u0027          Living costs are set to rise as a result of Brexit, say economists  But while there seems to be agreement over an improvement of the economy up to now and positive expectations about wages in the coming months, some economists were concerned about housing affordability and the rise in the cost of living.While six out of nine saw wages improve in the next half year, three saw housing affordability worsen.When asked what they thought Brexit would bring, higher trading and living costs were the most likely outcomes cited by five and four out of nine economists respectively.Three also expected Brexit to weigh on the pound, meaning weaker exchange rates for holidaymakers.James Smith at ING said: \u0027Overall, the recent dataflow has suggested the economy has regained some poise after a particularly weak first quarter. \u0027With wage growth still performing reasonably well, it looks like the Bank is gearing up for a rate rise in August.\u0027But what comes thereafter is less certain.

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall. They are committed to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be part of for many years to come.’Ramsay, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, is a regular customer at cafes and pubs in Rock.‘He has been very polite so far,’ said one local. ‘We get the feeling he is on his best behaviour because there has been a lot of anger about him knocking down the house. But that’s what the rich do around here. They buy somewhere for the view and tear it down so they can put something trendy up.’Ramsay thrives on controversy, though. Indeed, he has made a career out of it — both on and off camera.He was once inseparable from his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who managed Gordon Ramsay Holdings, until they fell out when Ramsay accused Hutcheson of plundering £1.4 million from his business and sacked him.Hutcheson was jailed for six months last year after an expert hired by Ramsay discovered he had hacked into the company’s computer system following his dismissal.As someone who worked closely with Ramsay for many years says: ‘Gordon will go to great lengths to get what he wants and feel that he’s winning.’A fact which will undoubtedly fill his Cornish neighbours’ hearts with sorrow. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/23/4EA2472100000578-0-image-m-51_1532731641770.jpg","title":"Universities offering unconditional places harm level results","story":"    Students enjoying the sunshine in Russell Square, London. Almost half of students who get unconditional offers do not reach minimum A-level requirements for coursesStudents traditionally have been given university places on condition that they achieve certain grades – but an unconditional offer means they get their place regardless of how badly they perform.The statistics show students slack off in their exams once grades are no longer integral to going to university. It is a pattern likely to be similar at dozens of other universities which have been dishing out unconditional offers this year.A Daily Mail investigation has found elite Russell Group universities Birmingham, Newcastle and Queen’s Belfast all make unconditional offers as do Sussex and Lancaster. Female private school teacher, 35, who groomed and sexually...\u0027Your child is on track\u0027: Principal says C grades should be...Share this articleAcross all universities, more than a fifth of students received unconditional offers this year.Yesterday, critics accused universities of damaging students’ employment prospects by encouraging them to take their feet off the pedal in sixth-form studies.Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said: ‘Students with unconditional offers may not work to their fullest for their A-levels.‘Employers are increasingly unconvinced by degree classifications, as so many students are now leaving with firsts and 2:1s. They are often looking at A-levels to see how able candidates are in comparison with other young people.’          An unconditional offer means students get their university place regardless of how badly they performOf 181 students given an unconditional offer at Kent last year, 44 per cent failed to achieve the standard entry requirement of ABB. The offers related to two departments – English and history. Of those given offers for English, who accepted, 2 per cent dropped seven grades. Kent University’s report said: ‘The discrepancy in grades between predicted and actual grades is a concern and one the department was more than aware of when entering into the scheme. There were a handful of students who would not have been made offers to study English with their actual grades if they had not been made an unconditional offer.’ A survey by this newspaper has also found other incentives are being offered to entice students.Universities are fiercely competing to attract students after the numbers cap was lifted, which has created an oversupply of places.At Queen’s University Belfast, students are offered tuition fee help, free flights home, sports membership, cinema passes and free bedding. It uses a ‘gif’ – or short video – of pop star Rihanna to advertise its incentive scheme.The revelations come after universities minister Sam Gyimah branded universities ‘irresponsible’ for focusing on ‘bums on seats’ rather than encouraging high A-level performance. He threatened to stop universities making offers before A-level results day unless they mend their ways.n The London School of Economics is way below average for student satisfaction despite promising to improve a year ago, with students claiming it cares too much about its international research reputation.A National Student Survey shows levels fell three points to 71 per cent – the average for all universities is 83. LSE director Minouche Shafik said: ‘Improving student satisfaction is our top priority. We are changing our assessment process, improving academic support and feedback, and developing student services on campus.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/14/4E1EF56E00000578-0-image-m-58_1531314046650.jpg","title":"Generation lonely 1 8 middle aged people never wed amid decline marriage","story":"    A generation of middle-aged people have been left living on their own because of the decline of marriageThe change threatens to impose a greater burden on public services because people living on their own cannot rely on a partner to help them in need.Such worries have led Theresa May to appoint a minister for loneliness.According to the report from the ONS, which was based on large-scale surveys, 12.9 per cent of people in England and Wales aged between 50 and 64 had never married last year, up from 6.1 per cent in 2002.The ONS estimates that, in 2002, 21.7 per cent of people in the 50-64 age group were not living with a partner, either because they had never married or because they were orced, and were not cohabiting.Daughter, 64, who killed her bullying father with a shovel...How you could live in paradise, earn £50k a year, and barely...Share this articleBy 2017 the share living alone had gone up to 25.7 per cent.The report said: ‘Marital status and living arrangements can have a bearing on demand for health and social care services, including the provision of informal care, and life expectancy.’Patricia Morgan, an academic and author on family issues, said: ‘Each marriage is a mini welfare state. But when people are not providing for each other, they can become a big burden on the taxpayer.‘People forget that those who live alone often have to be provided for by public services.

But as with so many other consequences of family breakdown, it will keep getting worse so long as we keep turning our backs on marriage.‘Start valuing marriage again and we have a decent shot at turning the tide of loneliness.‘Keep pretending unmarried cohabitation is OK and the tide of loneliness will continue to rise.’The ONS report said that just over half the population of England and Wales over the age of 16 in 2017 were married – 51 per cent.The level has dropped from 54.8 in 2002.

Bold, determined, ruthless, Haddad was the founder of the far-Left Popular Front for the Liberation of PalestineLittle by little, he began to die. His Palestinian friends contacted the East German secret police, who flew him to a hospital in East Berlin. Ten days later, bleeding from every orifice, Haddad died in agony.The doctors were baffled. But back in Israel, Mossad congratulated itself on a job well done.What happened to Haddad, argues Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman in a riveting new book, was merely the most melodramatic example of what is now an enduring pattern.Israel, a country born in bloodshed, has become the world leader in assassinations.The numbers alone are extraordinary. Not only have Mossad’s secret agents killed more people than the agents of any other state since World War II, but the pace has rapidly increased, with some 800 operations in the past decade.Hugged by a monster: Syrian dictator Assad and his British...Israel\u0027s Defence Minister vows to build 400 new homes in the...Share this articleThe number of deaths will never be known for sure, but they are in the thousands.There is, of course, something irresistibly fascinating about the idea of the globe-trotting secret agent, moving through the murky world of Middle Eastern politics with a licence to kill. And some of Bergman’s stories do have the flavour of a Hollywood spy blockbuster.One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian Candidate, with Mossad hiring a Swedish-born psychologist to brainwash a Palestinian prisoner into murdering Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.The psychologist picked a suitable prisoner and spent three months hypnotising him with the simple message: ‘Arafat bad. He must be removed’.The prisoner, known only as Fatkhi, was trained to shoot at pictures of Arafat, hidden in a specially prepared room.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh (pictured) whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing,On December 19, 1968, a Mossad team smuggled Fatkhi across the River Jordan, from where he was supposed to infiltrate Arafat’s headquarters.Then they waited. Five hours later, news came. Fatkhi had wasted no time. He had gone straight to a police station and accused Mossad of trying to brainwash him. The operation was an abject failure.In recent years, however, Mossad has lived up to its reputation as the most efficient secret killing machine in the world. One operation in Dubai proves the point. In January 2010, a team of several dozen Mossad agents flew to the oil-rich emirate on false passports, wearing wigs and false moustaches.Disguised as tourists and tennis players — some of them even carried racquets — they broke into a room at the luxurious Al-Bustan Hotel.There they waited for their quarry, top Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. As soon as al-Mabhouh let himself into his room, they grabbed him and used a high-tech ultrasound instrument to inject poison into his neck without even breaking the skin.He died within moments. Four hours later, most of the team had already flown out of Dubai. Job done.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh, whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing, pictured All this might sound swashbuckling or heroic. In reality, there is nothing glamorous about Bergman’s story.Indeed, the first man to die in his book is not some Palestinian terrorist or Left-wing extremist. It is a British policeman: Detective Superintendent Tom Wilkin, from Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast.In the autumn of 1944, Wilkin was in Jerusalem, where he was in charge of cracking down on Zionist guerillas.At the time, Jerusalem was part of British-governed Palestine, where the authorities were struggling to keep a lid on the tensions between Zionists — who wanted an independent Jewish state — and their Palestinian neighbours.To the Jewish militants in the terrorist Stern Gang, Wilkin was not a man. He was a target. In September, 1944, as he was strolling down a street, a boy sitting outside a grocery store threw down his hat — a sign the target was in range.Moments later, two young Jewish men opened fire with revolvers. Wilkin ‘managed to turn around and draw his pistol,’ one assailant, David Shomron, recalled, ‘but then he fell face first. A spurt of blood came out of his forehead, like a fountain.’Shomron did not feel the slightest remorse. ‘Not even a little twinge of guilt,’ he said later. ‘We believed the more coffins that reached London, the closer the day of freedom would be.’  One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian CandidateThat terrible phrase — ‘the more coffins that reached London’ — captures the mood of Bergman’s book. For, as cold-blooded as this sounds, Shomron was proved right.Faced with a wave of killings, including the infamous 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, in which 91 mostly British officials were killed, Clement Attlee’s government decided to get out. The Zionists got what they wanted.But the blood that gushed from poor Tom Wilkin’s head would soon become a torrent.The state of Israel was born amid brutal ethnic cleansing, with Jewish and Palestinian neighbours slaughtering one another in their thousands, while the new country’s Arab neighbours tried to strangle it at birth. It is hardly surprising that, ever since, Israel’s leaders have been driven by insecurity. After all, Israel has always been surrounded by hostile states, most of which deny that it even has the right to exist.On top of that, no Israeli can ever forget the awful shadow of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis.          Former Mossad director Meir Dagan (pictured) who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass graveEven today, hatred of Jews remains a monstrous feature of Europe’s political landscape — as evidenced by the appalling goings-on inside the Labour Party, where leader Jeremy Corbyn and his friends have turned a blind eye to the resurgence of the most poisonous anti- Semitism. No wonder, then, that in the struggle for survival, Israel’s leaders have reached so often for the bomb and bullet.‘If someone comes to kill you,’ says the sacred Jewish text, the Talmud, ‘rise up and kill him first.’As Bergman argues, that has been the principle guiding Mossad, as well as Israel’s internal security service Shin Bet and the army intelligence agency Aman, since the state’s foundation 70 years ago.Former Mossad director Meir Dagan, who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass grave.The lesson, Dagan told Bergman before his death in 2016, was that ‘most of the Jews in the Holocaust died without fighting. We must never reach that situation again, kneeling, without the ability to fight for our lives.’Bergman’s own story, by the way, is fascinating. Although this book has earned him a reputation as a whistle-blower, he is the very antithesis of a simplistic, bleeding-hearted activist.Born in 1972 to parents who were both Holocaust survivors, he did his national service in the intelligence unit of Israel’s Military Police Corps, has a PhD from Cambridge and is now a senior correspondent for Israel’s largest newspaper.Based on 1,000 interviews and vast numbers of leaked documents, his book often reads like a John le Carre novel. But it took considerable courage for him to publish it.          The document taken by a Nazi officer was found in the camp after it\u0027s liberation on April 15, 1945. Hidden in Argentina, Eichmann was captured in a street of a Buenos Aires suburb by a team of Mossad and Shin Bet agents on May 11, 1960 and taken to Israel without being detected by Argentine authorities. Eichmann was tried, sentenced to death and executed in Jerusalem on May 30, 1962While he was working on it, the chief of the Israel Defense Forces accused him of ‘aggravated espionage’ and even asked the security services to take action against him.Why? The reason is that Bergman sheds an unsparing light on the human cost of Israel’s targeted killings policy. He shows, for example, that when operations have taken place overseas, Israel’s agents were, and probably still are, unforgivably casual about civilian victims.Perhaps the most chilling section of his book concerns an operation in 1973 — and which was about as far from the glamour and romance of a James Bond thriller as you could possibly imagine.That summer, Mossad was on the hunt for Ali Hassan Salameh, one of the most wanted men in the world. Salameh was chief of operations for Black September, the Palestinian terrorist group that murdered 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.Mossad wanted him dead, but the trail had gone cold. Then came a miracle. In Lillehammer, Norway, an Israeli secret agent spotted Salameh in a cafe. Word went back to Tel Aviv and a hit squad was assembled. On July 21, as Salameh and his girlfriend got off a bus on their way home from the cinema, the assassins were waiting in a rented Volvo. They leaped out of the car, fired eight shots, jumped back in their car and screeched away, leaving their target in a pool of blood.It was almost the perfect hit, but for just one problem. They had killed the wrong man.It was not Salameh, but Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter with a heavily pregnant wife.In the aftermath, Norwegian police arrested six Israeli agents. Five served time in Norway, though all were released quickly under a secret deal. When the five returned to Israel, they were greeted as heroes. Few questioned the basic morality of the operation it was just a shame, they thought, that Mossad had got the wrong man.But they did get him eventually. On January 22, 1979, Salameh had just left his Beirut apartment when a female Israeli agent, watching from her balcony, pressed a button and a gigantic car bomb ripped through the street.Eight bystanders were also killed, including a German nun and a British student, but nobody at Mossad cared. ‘You get used to killing,’ explains former security chief Ami Ayalon. ‘Human life becomes easy to dispose of. You spend a quarter of an hour, 20 minutes, on who to kill.’In a chillingly familiar phrase, Ayalon even calls this the ‘banality of evil’ — words borrowed from the German philosopher Hannah Arendt, who used it to describe the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. That tells its own story.And although Bergman shows why decent people can feel they have no choice but to take terrible decisions, he also shows the consequences of crossing the line between good and evil.In the early Eighties, for example, Israeli defence minister, and later prime minister, Ariel Sharon’s obsession with killing Yasser Arafat led him into one of the darkest chapters in Israel’s modern history. At the time, Israel was embroiled in a horrific civil war in Lebanon, which killed at least 120,000 people.There, on Sharon’s orders, his army colluded with the local Christian Phalange, a militia who murdered hundreds, if not thousands, of Muslims in a Beirut slaughterhouse, cut off their ears as souvenirs and buried their bodies in lime pits. Almost incredibly, Sharon did not stop there.Some of Bergman’s interviewees told him that on five occasions in 1982, Sharon seriously contemplated shooting down an ordinary civilian airliner when he heard that Arafat might be aboard.On each occasion the Israeli military refused to obey, sometimes deliberately dithering until it was too late. Had they not done so, hundreds of ordinary passengers would have died in what Bergman calls ‘an intentional war crime’.No doubt all this will be grist to the mill of Israel’s critics. On the Left, in particular, criticism of Israel has become an automatic reflex, often tinged with more than a hint of anti-Semitism.There are, of course, good reasons to be critical of Israel. I find it impossible to justify its harsh treatment of the defeated Palestinians, or its callous, cynical policy of expanding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.Yet after all the Jews have suffered — pogroms, persecution and the unspeakable obscenity of the Holocaust — what reasonable person would begrudge them a homeland of their own?And who can blame them for fighting to defend that homeland from those who would destroy it?Ever since 1948, as Bergman himself points out, the threats to Israel’s existence have been only too real. One of his book’s most powerful images is a picture of an Israeli woman, drenched in her own blood, being carried away after a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.Sharon used to show it to foreign diplomats whenever they questioned Israel’s targeted assassination programme. Given Israel’s bloody history and dangerous present, I understand why its agents feel they must act as they do.The question, though, is whether the killings are working. For the past 70 years, the deaths have piled up, yet still there is no peace. The blood flows, but still Israel is not safe.Its enemies, of course, deserve a large share of the blame. But perhaps killing has become so easy that Israel’s leaders have stopped looking for other solutions. Either way, the end is nowhere in sight — and so Mossad’s killings go on. Because of their secretive nature, they rarely make the headlines.But even as you are reading these words, someone, somewhere, is planning the next hit. Rise And Kill First: The Secret History Of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations, by Ronen Bergman, is published by John Murray, price £20."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/20/4EA0AC1B00000578-0-image-a-3_1532718332079.jpg","title":"Britain increasing foreign aid booming China oil rich Nigeria","story":"    Britain is giving ever-increasing amounts of foreign aid to booming China and oil-rich Nigeria, accounts have revealed (stock image)Meanwhile, Britain gave £92.6million to India – which also has its own space mission – despite promises by ministers to stop funding the fast-growing country.The spending comes as public services in Britain are crying out for cash.Many town halls say they don’t have enough money to deal with the social care crisis. Schools and care homes are also desperate for increased Government spending, while Theresa May has promised to find an extra £20billion for the NHS.Last night, MPs demanded a ‘root-and-branch’ reform of aid spending and a fresh review of Britain’s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid. Silicon Valley spies: The murky web of Chinese tech workers,...Awkward moment Trump reaches out to hold EU chief Juncker\u0027s...Share this articleThe report from the Department for International Development (DfID) showed that while the department had stopped its aid programme to China in 2011, other Whitehall ministries continue to hand over large sums. These amounts contribute towards the 0.7 per cent target. Of the £46.9million handed over last year, 56 per cent came from the business department and 27 per cent from the Foreign Office.UK-funded schemes included a schools programme to encourage children to consume less salt, and improving dementia care in the port city of Qingdao. Britain has also underwritten a European scheme to help China plant trees to compensate for its contribution to global warming.Campaigners have been asking why the UK is still funding competitors whose economies are racing ahead.Only yesterday the Chinese shopping app Pinduoduo – valued at double the entire British aid budget of £13.9billion – was floated on the New York stock exchange.As the app debuted on the Nasdaq, its share prices soared by 35 per cent, giving the company a value of £26billion.China is so wealthy that it has its own aid programme. The superpower also spends millions on new airports and urban development.James Price, campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Time and again we have been told by politicians across Whitehall that the unjustifiable sending of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash to countries with space programmes and larger economies than our own would stop. But it hasn’t. This is completely unacceptable and tantamount to lying.’ Meanwhile, Britain’s aid grants to oil-rich Nigeria have come in for criticism. Three years ago it was reported that the west African country paid nearly 24,000 salaries to non-existent government workers.The country’s space programme spent millions buying three satellites and plans to send a man into space by 2030.A study of one £230million British aid programme to boost schools in Nigeria found it had produced ‘no major improvement in pupil learning’. Researchers found teachers at subsidised schools frequently failed to turn up and children were left to play football all day.The Government pledged to end aid to wealthy India in 2012. Despite this, tens of millions are still pouring in. Last year’s total was more than £92million – although this was less than the previous year.Some 59 per cent of India’s aid was given by DfID and 21 per cent by the business department. Much of the money goes towards what DfID describes as ‘technical assistance’ programmes. Other departments fund private sector programmes that help the poor.The UK is now the only major economy in the world to hit the controversial foreign aid spending target.Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said: ‘There is little public support for this 0.7 ring-fenced, inflation-proof budget, when vital services are being cut back here in the UK. A root and branch review of DfID, its budget and operations is needed and ministers need to take control back from empire-building officials or risk a collapse in public support all together.’A Government spokesman said: ‘Our aid commitment increases Britain’s global influence and alongside our world class defence and diplomacy helps the UK to create opportunity, peace and prosperity worldwide... We have robust processes in place to scrutinise our projects to ensure that all UK aid is effective and represents value for money.’Although Nigeria is oil-rich, a third of its population is below the national poverty line. Since 2016, UK aid increased in light of the humanitarian crisis driven by the Boko Haram jihadists.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/09/4E9CDBCD00000578-0-image-a-12_1532680043999.jpg","title":"Aer Lingus pilot gets heated exchange air traffic control","story":"    An Aer Lingus pilot got into a heated exchange with an air traffic controller after he was made to circle around New York\u0027s JFK airport for an hour on Sunday after takeoff The flight from HAIL!

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall. They are committed to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be part of for many years to come.’Ramsay, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, is a regular customer at cafes and pubs in Rock.‘He has been very polite so far,’ said one local. ‘We get the feeling he is on his best behaviour because there has been a lot of anger about him knocking down the house. But that’s what the rich do around here. They buy somewhere for the view and tear it down so they can put something trendy up.’Ramsay thrives on controversy, though. Indeed, he has made a career out of it — both on and off camera.He was once inseparable from his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who managed Gordon Ramsay Holdings, until they fell out when Ramsay accused Hutcheson of plundering £1.4 million from his business and sacked him.Hutcheson was jailed for six months last year after an expert hired by Ramsay discovered he had hacked into the company’s computer system following his dismissal.As someone who worked closely with Ramsay for many years says: ‘Gordon will go to great lengths to get what he wants and feel that he’s winning.’A fact which will undoubtedly fill his Cornish neighbours’ hearts with sorrow. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/11/4E9DE25C00000578-0-image-a-28_1532686890061.jpg","title":"Universities offering unconditional places harm level results","story":"    Students enjoying the sunshine in Russell Square, London. Almost half of students who get unconditional offers do not reach minimum A-level requirements for coursesStudents traditionally have been given university places on condition that they achieve certain grades – but an unconditional offer means they get their place regardless of how badly they perform.The statistics show students slack off in their exams once grades are no longer integral to going to university. It is a pattern likely to be similar at dozens of other universities which have been dishing out unconditional offers this year.A Daily Mail investigation has found elite Russell Group universities Birmingham, Newcastle and Queen’s Belfast all make unconditional offers as do Sussex and Lancaster. Female private school teacher, 35, who groomed and sexually...\u0027Your child is on track\u0027: Principal says C grades should be...Share this articleAcross all universities, more than a fifth of students received unconditional offers this year.Yesterday, critics accused universities of damaging students’ employment prospects by encouraging them to take their feet off the pedal in sixth-form studies.Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said: ‘Students with unconditional offers may not work to their fullest for their A-levels.‘Employers are increasingly unconvinced by degree classifications, as so many students are now leaving with firsts and 2:1s. They are often looking at A-levels to see how able candidates are in comparison with other young people.’          An unconditional offer means students get their university place regardless of how badly they performOf 181 students given an unconditional offer at Kent last year, 44 per cent failed to achieve the standard entry requirement of ABB. The offers related to two departments – English and history. Of those given offers for English, who accepted, 2 per cent dropped seven grades. Kent University’s report said: ‘The discrepancy in grades between predicted and actual grades is a concern and one the department was more than aware of when entering into the scheme. There were a handful of students who would not have been made offers to study English with their actual grades if they had not been made an unconditional offer.’ A survey by this newspaper has also found other incentives are being offered to entice students.Universities are fiercely competing to attract students after the numbers cap was lifted, which has created an oversupply of places.At Queen’s University Belfast, students are offered tuition fee help, free flights home, sports membership, cinema passes and free bedding. It uses a ‘gif’ – or short video – of pop star Rihanna to advertise its incentive scheme.The revelations come after universities minister Sam Gyimah branded universities ‘irresponsible’ for focusing on ‘bums on seats’ rather than encouraging high A-level performance. He threatened to stop universities making offers before A-level results day unless they mend their ways.n The London School of Economics is way below average for student satisfaction despite promising to improve a year ago, with students claiming it cares too much about its international research reputation.A National Student Survey shows levels fell three points to 71 per cent – the average for all universities is 83. LSE director Minouche Shafik said: ‘Improving student satisfaction is our top priority. We are changing our assessment process, improving academic support and feedback, and developing student services on campus.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/15/4E9EAC8100000578-0-image-a-84_1532703389341.jpg","title":"How Israels secret service world leader assassins","story":"    Forty years ago, Wadie Haddad was one of the world’s most wanted men.

Not only have Mossad’s secret agents killed more people than the agents of any other state since World War II, but the pace has rapidly increased, with some 800 operations in the past decade.Hugged by a monster: Syrian dictator Assad and his British...Israel\u0027s Defence Minister vows to build 400 new homes in the...Share this articleThe number of deaths will never be known for sure, but they are in the thousands.There is, of course, something irresistibly fascinating about the idea of the globe-trotting secret agent, moving through the murky world of Middle Eastern politics with a licence to kill. And some of Bergman’s stories do have the flavour of a Hollywood spy blockbuster.One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian Candidate, with Mossad hiring a Swedish-born psychologist to brainwash a Palestinian prisoner into murdering Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.The psychologist picked a suitable prisoner and spent three months hypnotising him with the simple message: ‘Arafat bad. He must be removed’.The prisoner, known only as Fatkhi, was trained to shoot at pictures of Arafat, hidden in a specially prepared room.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh (pictured) whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing,On December 19, 1968, a Mossad team smuggled Fatkhi across the River Jordan, from where he was supposed to infiltrate Arafat’s headquarters.Then they waited. Five hours later, news came. Fatkhi had wasted no time. He had gone straight to a police station and accused Mossad of trying to brainwash him. The operation was an abject failure.In recent years, however, Mossad has lived up to its reputation as the most efficient secret killing machine in the world. One operation in Dubai proves the point. In January 2010, a team of several dozen Mossad agents flew to the oil-rich emirate on false passports, wearing wigs and false moustaches.Disguised as tourists and tennis players — some of them even carried racquets — they broke into a room at the luxurious Al-Bustan Hotel.There they waited for their quarry, top Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. As soon as al-Mabhouh let himself into his room, they grabbed him and used a high-tech ultrasound instrument to inject poison into his neck without even breaking the skin.He died within moments. Four hours later, most of the team had already flown out of Dubai. Job done.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh, whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing, pictured All this might sound swashbuckling or heroic. In reality, there is nothing glamorous about Bergman’s story.Indeed, the first man to die in his book is not some Palestinian terrorist or Left-wing extremist. It is a British policeman: Detective Superintendent Tom Wilkin, from Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast.In the autumn of 1944, Wilkin was in Jerusalem, where he was in charge of cracking down on Zionist guerillas.At the time, Jerusalem was part of British-governed Palestine, where the authorities were struggling to keep a lid on the tensions between Zionists — who wanted an independent Jewish state — and their Palestinian neighbours.To the Jewish militants in the terrorist Stern Gang, Wilkin was not a man. He was a target. In September, 1944, as he was strolling down a street, a boy sitting outside a grocery store threw down his hat — a sign the target was in range.Moments later, two young Jewish men opened fire with revolvers. Wilkin ‘managed to turn around and draw his pistol,’ one assailant, David Shomron, recalled, ‘but then he fell face first. A spurt of blood came out of his forehead, like a fountain.’Shomron did not feel the slightest remorse. ‘Not even a little twinge of guilt,’ he said later. ‘We believed the more coffins that reached London, the closer the day of freedom would be.’  One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian CandidateThat terrible phrase — ‘the more coffins that reached London’ — captures the mood of Bergman’s book. For, as cold-blooded as this sounds, Shomron was proved right.Faced with a wave of killings, including the infamous 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, in which 91 mostly British officials were killed, Clement Attlee’s government decided to get out. The Zionists got what they wanted.But the blood that gushed from poor Tom Wilkin’s head would soon become a torrent.The state of Israel was born amid brutal ethnic cleansing, with Jewish and Palestinian neighbours slaughtering one another in their thousands, while the new country’s Arab neighbours tried to strangle it at birth. It is hardly surprising that, ever since, Israel’s leaders have been driven by insecurity. After all, Israel has always been surrounded by hostile states, most of which deny that it even has the right to exist.On top of that, no Israeli can ever forget the awful shadow of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis.          Former Mossad director Meir Dagan (pictured) who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass graveEven today, hatred of Jews remains a monstrous feature of Europe’s political landscape — as evidenced by the appalling goings-on inside the Labour Party, where leader Jeremy Corbyn and his friends have turned a blind eye to the resurgence of the most poisonous anti- Semitism. No wonder, then, that in the struggle for survival, Israel’s leaders have reached so often for the bomb and bullet.‘If someone comes to kill you,’ says the sacred Jewish text, the Talmud, ‘rise up and kill him first.’As Bergman argues, that has been the principle guiding Mossad, as well as Israel’s internal security service Shin Bet and the army intelligence agency Aman, since the state’s foundation 70 years ago.Former Mossad director Meir Dagan, who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass grave.The lesson, Dagan told Bergman before his death in 2016, was that ‘most of the Jews in the Holocaust died without fighting. We must never reach that situation again, kneeling, without the ability to fight for our lives.’Bergman’s own story, by the way, is fascinating. Although this book has earned him a reputation as a whistle-blower, he is the very antithesis of a simplistic, bleeding-hearted activist.Born in 1972 to parents who were both Holocaust survivors, he did his national service in the intelligence unit of Israel’s Military Police Corps, has a PhD from Cambridge and is now a senior correspondent for Israel’s largest newspaper.Based on 1,000 interviews and vast numbers of leaked documents, his book often reads like a John le Carre novel. But it took considerable courage for him to publish it.          The document taken by a Nazi officer was found in the camp after it\u0027s liberation on April 15, 1945. Hidden in Argentina, Eichmann was captured in a street of a Buenos Aires suburb by a team of Mossad and Shin Bet agents on May 11, 1960 and taken to Israel without being detected by Argentine authorities. Eichmann was tried, sentenced to death and executed in Jerusalem on May 30, 1962While he was working on it, the chief of the Israel Defense Forces accused him of ‘aggravated espionage’ and even asked the security services to take action against him.Why? The reason is that Bergman sheds an unsparing light on the human cost of Israel’s targeted killings policy. He shows, for example, that when operations have taken place overseas, Israel’s agents were, and probably still are, unforgivably casual about civilian victims.Perhaps the most chilling section of his book concerns an operation in 1973 — and which was about as far from the glamour and romance of a James Bond thriller as you could possibly imagine.That summer, Mossad was on the hunt for Ali Hassan Salameh, one of the most wanted men in the world. Salameh was chief of operations for Black September, the Palestinian terrorist group that murdered 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.Mossad wanted him dead, but the trail had gone cold. Then came a miracle. In Lillehammer, Norway, an Israeli secret agent spotted Salameh in a cafe. Word went back to Tel Aviv and a hit squad was assembled. On July 21, as Salameh and his girlfriend got off a bus on their way home from the cinema, the assassins were waiting in a rented Volvo. They leaped out of the car, fired eight shots, jumped back in their car and screeched away, leaving their target in a pool of blood.It was almost the perfect hit, but for just one problem. They had killed the wrong man.It was not Salameh, but Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter with a heavily pregnant wife.In the aftermath, Norwegian police arrested six Israeli agents. Five served time in Norway, though all were released quickly under a secret deal. When the five returned to Israel, they were greeted as heroes. Few questioned the basic morality of the operation it was just a shame, they thought, that Mossad had got the wrong man.But they did get him eventually. On January 22, 1979, Salameh had just left his Beirut apartment when a female Israeli agent, watching from her balcony, pressed a button and a gigantic car bomb ripped through the street.Eight bystanders were also killed, including a German nun and a British student, but nobody at Mossad cared. ‘You get used to killing,’ explains former security chief Ami Ayalon. ‘Human life becomes easy to dispose of. You spend a quarter of an hour, 20 minutes, on who to kill.’In a chillingly familiar phrase, Ayalon even calls this the ‘banality of evil’ — words borrowed from the German philosopher Hannah Arendt, who used it to describe the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. That tells its own story.And although Bergman shows why decent people can feel they have no choice but to take terrible decisions, he also shows the consequences of crossing the line between good and evil.In the early Eighties, for example, Israeli defence minister, and later prime minister, Ariel Sharon’s obsession with killing Yasser Arafat led him into one of the darkest chapters in Israel’s modern history. At the time, Israel was embroiled in a horrific civil war in Lebanon, which killed at least 120,000 people.There, on Sharon’s orders, his army colluded with the local Christian Phalange, a militia who murdered hundreds, if not thousands, of Muslims in a Beirut slaughterhouse, cut off their ears as souvenirs and buried their bodies in lime pits. Almost incredibly, Sharon did not stop there.Some of Bergman’s interviewees told him that on five occasions in 1982, Sharon seriously contemplated shooting down an ordinary civilian airliner when he heard that Arafat might be aboard.On each occasion the Israeli military refused to obey, sometimes deliberately dithering until it was too late. Had they not done so, hundreds of ordinary passengers would have died in what Bergman calls ‘an intentional war crime’.No doubt all this will be grist to the mill of Israel’s critics. On the Left, in particular, criticism of Israel has become an automatic reflex, often tinged with more than a hint of anti-Semitism.There are, of course, good reasons to be critical of Israel. I find it impossible to justify its harsh treatment of the defeated Palestinians, or its callous, cynical policy of expanding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.Yet after all the Jews have suffered — pogroms, persecution and the unspeakable obscenity of the Holocaust — what reasonable person would begrudge them a homeland of their own?And who can blame them for fighting to defend that homeland from those who would destroy it?Ever since 1948, as Bergman himself points out, the threats to Israel’s existence have been only too real. One of his book’s most powerful images is a picture of an Israeli woman, drenched in her own blood, being carried away after a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.Sharon used to show it to foreign diplomats whenever they questioned Israel’s targeted assassination programme. Given Israel’s bloody history and dangerous present, I understand why its agents feel they must act as they do.The question, though, is whether the killings are working. For the past 70 years, the deaths have piled up, yet still there is no peace. The blood flows, but still Israel is not safe.Its enemies, of course, deserve a large share of the blame. But perhaps killing has become so easy that Israel’s leaders have stopped looking for other solutions. Either way, the end is nowhere in sight — and so Mossad’s killings go on. Because of their secretive nature, they rarely make the headlines.But even as you are reading these words, someone, somewhere, is planning the next hit. Rise And Kill First: The Secret History Of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations, by Ronen Bergman, is published by John Murray, price £20."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/20/4EA0AC1B00000578-0-image-a-3_1532718332079.jpg","title":"Britain increasing foreign aid booming China oil rich Nigeria","story":"    Britain is giving ever-increasing amounts of foreign aid to booming China and oil-rich Nigeria, accounts have revealed (stock image)Meanwhile, Britain gave £92.6million to India – which also has its own space mission – despite promises by ministers to stop funding the fast-growing country.The spending comes as public services in Britain are crying out for cash.Many town halls say they don’t have enough money to deal with the social care crisis. Schools and care homes are also desperate for increased Government spending, while Theresa May has promised to find an extra £20billion for the NHS.Last night, MPs demanded a ‘root-and-branch’ reform of aid spending and a fresh review of Britain’s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid. Silicon Valley spies: The murky web of Chinese tech workers,...Awkward moment Trump reaches out to hold EU chief Juncker\u0027s...Share this articleThe report from the Department for International Development (DfID) showed that while the department had stopped its aid programme to China in 2011, other Whitehall ministries continue to hand over large sums. These amounts contribute towards the 0.7 per cent target. Of the £46.9million handed over last year, 56 per cent came from the business department and 27 per cent from the Foreign Office.UK-funded schemes included a schools programme to encourage children to consume less salt, and improving dementia care in the port city of Qingdao. Britain has also underwritten a European scheme to help China plant trees to compensate for its contribution to global warming.Campaigners have been asking why the UK is still funding competitors whose economies are racing ahead.Only yesterday the Chinese shopping app Pinduoduo – valued at double the entire British aid budget of £13.9billion – was floated on the New York stock exchange.As the app debuted on the Nasdaq, its share prices soared by 35 per cent, giving the company a value of £26billion.China is so wealthy that it has its own aid programme. The superpower also spends millions on new airports and urban development.James Price, campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Time and again we have been told by politicians across Whitehall that the unjustifiable sending of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash to countries with space programmes and larger economies than our own would stop. But it hasn’t. This is completely unacceptable and tantamount to lying.’ Meanwhile, Britain’s aid grants to oil-rich Nigeria have come in for criticism. Three years ago it was reported that the west African country paid nearly 24,000 salaries to non-existent government workers.The country’s space programme spent millions buying three satellites and plans to send a man into space by 2030.A study of one £230million British aid programme to boost schools in Nigeria found it had produced ‘no major improvement in pupil learning’. Researchers found teachers at subsidised schools frequently failed to turn up and children were left to play football all day.The Government pledged to end aid to wealthy India in 2012. Despite this, tens of millions are still pouring in. Last year’s total was more than £92million – although this was less than the previous year.Some 59 per cent of India’s aid was given by DfID and 21 per cent by the business department. Much of the money goes towards what DfID describes as ‘technical assistance’ programmes. Other departments fund private sector programmes that help the poor.The UK is now the only major economy in the world to hit the controversial foreign aid spending target.Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said: ‘There is little public support for this 0.7 ring-fenced, inflation-proof budget, when vital services are being cut back here in the UK. A root and branch review of DfID, its budget and operations is needed and ministers need to take control back from empire-building officials or risk a collapse in public support all together.’A Government spokesman said: ‘Our aid commitment increases Britain’s global influence and alongside our world class defence and diplomacy helps the UK to create opportunity, peace and prosperity worldwide... We have robust processes in place to scrutinise our projects to ensure that all UK aid is effective and represents value for money.’Although Nigeria is oil-rich, a third of its population is below the national poverty line. Since 2016, UK aid increased in light of the humanitarian crisis driven by the Boko Haram jihadists.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/28/09/4EA3689100000578-6001799-image-a-59_1532765803899.jpg","title":"Britons breathe sigh relief colossal storms bring 97F heatwave dramatic climax","story":"    A wild storm can be seen from the window of a Ryanair plane which aborted its landing at the last moment and circled around          Lightning flashed over the Souter lighthouse in South Shields as heavy thunderstorms marked the end of the UK heatwave          Many were caught in the torrential downpours yesterday while travelling from London\u0027s West End by Oxford Circus Station           On the roads, motorists were warned of lightning, flash flooding and large hailstones as the UK\u0027s heatwave came to a close  Temperatures are expected to soar all the way to 99F (37C) today, before dropping back to the mid-70Fs (mid-20s) tomorrow      iframe HTML tag.Many took to Twitter to express their joy at finally experiencing some rain this British Summer and posted hilarious snaps illustrating their relief that showers have finally hit the UK. Tweeting a still of the well-known rainy scene in Shawshank Redemption, Owen Cashman wrote: \u0027Live pictures of me walking farm right now #drought #rain #shawshank.\u0027The movie theme continued with one social media user posting a still of the aged Rose from Titanic saying: \u0027It\u0027s been 84 years...\u0027.Millions around the globe enjoy spectacular  Blood Moon:...No longer carrying cash in your wallet?

She talks about trans parents, the male psyche and why Sheryl Sandberg’s advice for working mothers isn’t feasibleEveryone in the world has or has had one, yet our conception of what it is to be a mother is fatally flawed, argues Jacqueline Rose. The consequences of our devotion to that skewed vision are dire, ranging from a systemic hatred of single mothers, punished for perceived sexual and social irresponsibility, to an expectation of maternal perfection and joyfulness at damaging odds with the messy reality of birthing and raising children. Her book, Mothers: An Essay on Love and Cruelty, is, she tells me as we sit at the kitchen table of her north London flat, an attempt “to raise the ante and have a truer, more virulently exhilarating and disturbing account of motherhood in our general culture. That’s what the book’s trying to do it’s trying to say, can we put this out there?”It’s not all that Rose has put out there this week, perhaps the most surprising Man Booker prize longlist ever has been published, and Rose is one of the judges. There are few big names, plenty of newcomers, and of the 13 books, one is a graphic novel and one a thriller. “In each case it felt as if our chosen novels were alerting us to something very hard to take on board but that we urgently needed to think about.”“In such dire times, we urgently need the dissident, awkward, creative, voice of fiction,” Rose says. It’s not hard to detect her own interests in the list – exemplified in a lifetime of work that encompasses feminism, psychoanalysis, politics and literature but, she says of the judging process, “I found myself truly stretched.”In Mothers, the “this” that she wants to get “out there” is multiple, complex, various. Even when Rose addresses apparently concrete social issues – such as the treatment of “maternity tourists” by the rightwing press, or the incidence of depression among working-class black women in post-apartheid South Africa – she is doing so in the knowledge that “behind any inidual life of a mother, there are whole histories pressing on who she is and who she’s allowed to be”. In a profoundly moving final chapter, Rose writes about her maternal grandmother, whose family died in Chelmno concentration camp during the second world war, and the effect that it had on Rose’s own mother, who was “married off” when she was only 20 in order to fulfil her parents’ desire for their children’s settlement and security.Of her childhood – she was born and grew up in London – Rose writes: “Every morning before we went to school, my sister and I, and eventually our younger sister, were expected to join in the ritual three-cloth cleansing of the entire home: wet, dry and methylated spirits. As I look back on it now, I don’t think, as she cleaned the house spotless, that my mother ever realised that there was nothing she needed to expiate, that she had not been the perpetrator – not ever, not now or in the distant past – of any crime.”One of the most frequently recurring themes of the book, and indeed of our conversation, is Rose’s belief that mothers are required to perform a deeper, if not impossible, cleanup job their unsolicited task is to preserve the fiction that the world is a safe place when, as she points out, “if anybody knows that’s rubbish, it’s a mother”.Back in 1991, Rose published The Haunting of Sylvia Plath, in which she tore down the construction of Plath-as-icon, not least through the husbanding of her estate by her widower, Ted Hughes, and his sister, Olwyn it was described by Elaine Showalter as “a stunning account” of the way Plath’s legacy was controlled.Now, Rose says, when she thinks of that book, “what’s interesting is that I don’t discuss her as a mother, hardly at all, and I have to say I think that’s probably because I wasn’t one then”. She adopted her daughter, Mia, who is now 23, from China when she was seven and a half months old as she and her then partner, psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, went through the process, her book on Plath must have felt like recent history.Speaking now, Rose takes particular notice of the fact that Plath began her collection Ariel, published posthumously, with the poem “Morning Song”, and its opening line, “Love set you going like a fat gold watch”, about the experience of giving birth. She wanted, Rose notes, to end with the poems referred to as the Bee Sequence, and “Wintering”, the last word of which is “spring” – with, in between, “the darkness of shadows, as if she knows that to be a mother is to be in touch with what’s dark if you want love to spring you’ve got to be in touch with darkness”. Hughes changed both the composition of the collection and its sequencing, in order, says Rose, “to make her death look poetically inevitable, and therefore destroys what she was doing around the discourse of mothering”.The relationship between literary texts and psychoanalytic theory is at the heart of much of Rose’s work, finding expression in her abiding preoccupation with Proust, who crops up not only in non-fiction such as 2011’s Proust Among the Nations: From Dreyfus to the Middle East but also in her only novel, Albertine, which creates another life for the object of Proust’s hero’s obsession. It was published in 2002, the first book that Rose wrote after the death of her sister, the philosopher Gillian Rose, at the age of 48. “I didn’t feel I could write in an academic way,” she said in an interview in 2012. “It’s exhilarating and frightening letting the floodgates open.”She has also written extensively – attracting some criticism – about the history and nature of Jewish nationalism, using the techniques of psychoanalysis to call for it to confront its fractured psyche. “You can feel her pain throbbing through these essays,” wrote the late Peter Preston in a review of her 2007 book The Last Resistance, which sought to track the evolution of Zionism to modern day Gaza.Throughout her work beats the belief that to leave the mind and the heart (a word she uses frequently) unexamined is to store up immense and unstoppable trouble for yourself, and for others. She half-laughs when she tells me about an essay by the analyst and paediatrician DW Winnicott, written in 1949, in which he lists the 18 reasons a mother has to hate her baby. “My favourite one is: she hates him because she can neither eat him or have sex with him. Which is such a shocking thing to say even now! So one of the things that really struck me is that there’s all this either hostility to mothers, or the expectation that they will make the world perfect.”Citing the example of Rachel Cusk’s A Life’s Work – “she was lambasted for it” – she says that women who do talk about “the immense equivocation and difficulty and psychic painfulness as well as joy of what it means to be a mother” are censured for drawing attention to anything approaching ambivalence. “It’s as if because mothers are in touch with the fraudulence of the things they’re being asked to do, then they’re hated.”If Mothers is happy to delve into the past – both far distant, as Rose dissects different readings of Medea, and muses on the civic aspect of motherhood in ancient Greece, and more recent, through the work of, for example, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Elena Ferrante and Roald Dahl – it is keenly aware of its responsibilities to the present. Rose believes that “feminism has realised that it can’t just talk about white, middle-class women. That’s a lesson that was hard-learned in the 70s and 80s, but if you’re thinking about mothers, you really can’t talk about them unless you talk about, for example, the fact that in America, the infant mortality rate for black babies is more than double what it is for white babies”.Referring to the 54,000 women that, according to a 2015 report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, lose their jobs in the UK every year as a result of pregnancy, and of the obstacles put in the way of them fulfilling basic health maintenance such as antenatal appointments, Rose says: “I could not believe the virulence of the hatred. And that goes alongside all this saccharine idealisation of the mother as the protector of the child, who makes the world safe for the child, and who is good, and who is virtuous.”Meanwhile, she argues, “there’s the experience, say, of giving birth. And of having a baby, which is at least a large part about mess, bodies, viscousness, mucus, shit, and then touching, holding, smelling, feeling. It’s about the most incredible range of busted boundaries around who we’re meant to think of ourselves as. And none of that mess is part of the public, official discourse on mothering.”She remembers telling an academic colleague whose childcare arrangements sometimes fell through to bring her baby to work with her, not only so that she could make her working life possible, but so people could see what was involved. “When somebody like Sheryl Sandberg says ‘lean in’,” she notes drily, “and make your office demands even when you’re having a baby, she’s not actually envisaging babies in board meetings, right? Because what can’t be stood, in that official, sanctioned, rather phallic, clean environment, is mess, smell, dirt, nappies, unpredictability, noise.”There are, of course, moments of joy, and of a more positive boundary-busting. When her adopted daughter was an infant, Rose found herself dozing off with her, “and waking up and thinking, the baby is lying on top of me, and then thinking, no, no, no, the baby’s inside you, that’s fine, go back to sleep. And then realising … that was really crazy and it gave me such pleasure. And it felt like she was really making a claim on me, and in me.”I ask her how rapidly changing ideas of what constitutes a family – indeed, a mother – fit into her view of the future. In the book, she writes about Susan Stryker, a trans woman and activist who describes holding her female partner’s body as she gives birth, and the physical feelings, as well as the emotions, that the experience provoked in her. What she learned from Stryker, says Rose, “is that the moment of becoming a mother is about being connected with something different from what you are. Because you never know who’s arriving … There’s a radical strangeness at the heart of giving birth. And what Stryker does say is let’s just push this as far as it can go.”She adds: “To answer your question simply, I feel that trans people are in touch with the peculiarity of what it means to make a gender distinction absolute and rigid, and therefore they’re in touch with the inherent strangeness of our sexual lives and that to give birth to someone is also to put you in touch with a kind of strangeness.”Documenting all the complexities and injustices around motherhood is one thing but how can they be changed?Two things would have to alter radically, says Rose. “One is the male psyche would have to undergo something of a revolution in terms of the fear of the maternal body, because it is a reminder of neediness, dependence, fragility, everything that in our culture men are told they must not be.”And the second, she argues, is that we would have to face “the poverty and immiseration” caused to vast swaths of people by austerity. “It doesn’t work what’s incredible is that people go on voting for it, as if they buy into the super-ego lie that we must suffer and be on top of things, and there’s something appropriate about the very viciousness of the social system.” And implicated in this scenario, she adds, are mothers – the people to whom we look to heal and to soothe the ills of the world. “What I’m saying very crudely is that you have to be a socialist and a bit of a Freudian to stop offloading on mothers two utterly banal truths about being a human subject, which is that the world is unjust and our hearts and bodies are frail.”• Mothers is published by Faber.

In Tokyo they carry parasols. Farmers in Bukhara fear for their future, while in Jordan, refugees cover themselves with wet towels.And anyone who can relies on air conditioning (AC).Around the world, people are trying to cope with the intense and prolonged heat. As always, the most vulnerable in society – the homeless, the elderly, the poor or disenfranchised – are suffering the most. Cities is investigating heat in cities for a special week of journalism next month. Tell us how heat has affected you. I live in a house on Waraq Island, in the Nile, with my uncles, their families and grandparents. When we were kids we used to swim in the Nile, and some of us still do to overcome the heat. The family saved up and bought one AC unit for the living room now that’s where everyone spends their day – preparing food, watching TV, playing or studying. But it doesn’t always work because the electricity is very weak.My grandmother used to put the bedsheets in the fridge or the cooler, or hold a bag of cold water against our backs. My mother used a trick from Upper Egypt: using sacks of rice and buckwheat to absorb the heat.I plan so that I can spend the day in air-conditioned offices at university or work, only returning home at night. I take the metro every day: when it’s hot, everyone is sweaty and smells. And sometimes the metro breaks down due to the heat.Reported by Ruth Michaelson with Adham Youssef in CairoIt’s much worse this summer than last year. The reflected heat off the ground has been much more intense compared with the last few years. I use a parasol but it doesn’t really help me,because the heat from the ground is so hot. I try to walk in the shade and also take lots of water, and then use AC in my home during the night. In past summers I used a timer to switch it off two hours after I fell asleep now I leave it on through the night. When I leave the office to get lunch, I try to go somewhere nearby. On weekends I try not to go out when the sun is really high. Sometimes I try to escape from Tokyo to cooler areas, but even there it’s too hot this year.When I was a kid I could sleep with the window open but lately I can’t. I’m concerned about temperatures getting hotter in the future due to climate change I hope America will stay signed up to the Paris agreement. We rely on AC more and more, which uses electricity, so I think it will get hotter because of that.Reported by Daniel Hurst in TokyoThere have been days when I couldn’t really go out for very long. It’s always been hot in Montreal for a few weeks here and there, but now it feels like it’s double the amount of time we have intense heat.Try to find a friendly tree in the city and give it a hug. You have to find some AC, so shopping centres are good and large stores. People should be aware that other people need AC and water. Give them the time of day and a smile, and pass along a little water.Reported by Jillian Kestler-D’Amours in MontrealThe prosperity of our whole region depends on the quality of cotton that we produce. Because of the extremely dry climate, we have to keep the soil as wet as possible during the summer to get a good crop in the autumn. This becomes very complicated because the available water evaporates faster as the temperature rises. A lot of local farmers get into debt just keeping the cotton fields watered. A new channel was created several years ago to get water to Bukhara’s fields from the Amu Darya, the river between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A couple of smaller rivers near Bukhara had dried out. Only 20 or 30 years ago the temperature did not rise too high, farming was easier, there was more rain in the summer.We have to take this issue seriously now. Life will be really harsh if the temperature keeps rising.Reported by Sevil KhikmatovaWorking outside is always worst at the beginning of a heatwave – as it goes on, the body adapts as much as it can, and you begin to get used to it. Here in the market, working during the afternoon is bearable because we have umbrellas above each stall.Working in the fields is much more difficult: there is no shade, you are constantly in the sun. We start working at 6am: it is light outside but not yet too hot. We rest from 11am and start work again after 4pm until it gets dark. It is also vital to dress properly for the Greek sun – light, light-coloured clothing and hats.Reported by Clea Skopeliti in AthensThis year’s heatwave has been remarkable, coupled with rare humidity on consecutive days – like living in a sauna. A colleague recalled that, five or so years ago, he could have cooled himself down in the shade at midday on a summer’s day now he’s soaked with sweat as soon as he steps outside, and AC is the only remedy.As a northern city in China, Beijing typically has low rainfall and humidity. Clothes could be dried quickly after washing this year it takes weeks. There are regular heavy downpours, I felt as if I were living in a coastal city.In the past only record-breaking temperatures have captured public attention in China. My home city of Wuhan is famous for its melting weather in summer. But my mom could still jog even on summer days. The highest temperature in Wuhan lately has been 38C, on July 21, and it stayed around 37-38C in the following days. It’s a matter of time before it reaches 40C or higher.Nowadays, people resort to spending their summer holidays in the mountains, where the temperature is lower. In the city, lots of concrete buildings spring up with limited ability to absorb the heat. The ecosystem possesses its own ability to adjust the temperature and to balance living conditions. We need to find a way to rebuild the ecosystem, to restore the balance.Submitted online to  CitiesIt’s a desert area, and we’re suffering. It is summer so it’s dusty. We live in a caravan, and it’s so hot because they are made of metal.We have different ways of coping. We wake early and soak the floor with water. Then we sprinkle water on ourselves. Most of the time we soak towels and put them on our heads. In dust storms, we can’t go outside. They are sudden and frequent. We have to close the windows, it’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them. We have issues with asthma. My son has respiratory infections on a regular basis.There is limited electricity in the camp. We have power from six in the evening until four in the morning. But we need it for electric fans during the peak temperatures in the day. We used to collect water with jerry cans and had to carry it for long distances. Now, with an operational water network, things are much easier. We don’t have to fight in a long queue to get our share of water.Reported by Oliver Holmes in JerusalemThis summer has been extreme, we went over 40C in July, which has had an average of 30C historically. For the first time, I installed AC in my house. My wife is pregnant, we simply couldn’t survive at home with the unbearable heat. We try to avoid using it because it’s not environmentally-friendly, we tried to get by with fans but we couldn’t.People who can afford to do so usually leave Tbilisi in August, to go to summer houses in one of the surrounding small villages. But because there was such heat, everybody tried to get out of the city earlier. There’s such smog, people don’t go out in the daytime anymore. The city feels empty.My impression is that, for the last five years or even longer, it’s been getting hotter and hotter every year. It is worrying. The local government is trying to improve air pollution, but it’s targeted at the use of private vehicles. It’s not only about cars, it’s also about the people who live in the city. We need more awareness, but it seems that the issue of climate change is low priority. People are more worried about other things.

Even if he didn’t understand consent, his mother should haveI’ve always believed, no matter how awkward the conversations might be, that it’s crucial for parents to teach their children about things such as disability, race, and gender from an early age to explain why strangers they might come across don’t look, sound, act or dress like they do. Growing up, I know it would have made my life a whole lot easier and spared me countless stares – and probably a fair bit of bullying, too.As I’ve got older, though, I’ve learned to appreciate that my arm is a part of who I am. It’s got me into a few awkward situations (although if I’m honest, I’ve also used it as an excuse to get out of a fair few too!) However, one encounter I had recently left me feeling trapped, and more awkward about myself than I had felt in years.I was on the train on the way home from work when a woman and her son sat down opposite me. After a few minutes, the boy – who can’t have been older than six or seven – walked over and started grabbing my left arm. Rather than intervening or saying anything, his mother simply sat there and smiled at me as her son treated my arm like a toy, inspecting it from various angles, prodding it, and moving it around.It was probably a mixture of shock and embarrassment that stopped me saying anything to either of them. He continued to touch my arm for about two minutes before seemingly getting bored and going back to his seat.Having had one hand for my entire life, I’m no stranger to people finding it interesting. I’ve had all sorts of queries, from the weirdly intrusive “Have you ever used it during sex?” to the downright offensive “How can you leave the house with one hand?”, and I generally encourage people to ask me things, no matter how ridiculous they might be.One of the most common questions people ask about my arm is whether they can touch it. Despite having always found this a bit of an odd one (I’ve never really understood what people think they’re going to get out of touching what is essentially just a forearm), I’ve almost always been willing, if they ask politely. However, where the incident on the train differs from my other experiences is consent.I understand that the boy was young and may not yet have an understanding of consent and bodily autonomy, but surely his mother should have done. Surely, she must have realised that it’s not all right for her son to walk up to strangers and start touching them. And if her son was adamant that he had to touch my arm, surely she could have asked my permission?At no point was my comfort with the situation considered. Not a single word was exchanged the entire time as I nervously sat there with my headphones on, trying to avoid eye contact with the child or his mum for fear of making the situation even more awkward for me than it already was. He made the odd “ooh” noise as he was seemingly enthralled, but other than that, there was simply silence for two minutes – and the following 20 minutes of our commute home.While some might say I should have said something (and sometimes, thinking back, I feel the same), ultimately it’s not my duty to educate anyone’s children on disability or consent.Yet had the boy’s mum asked me to explain to him why my arm is the way it is, I would have done so happily. I appreciate it must have been an awkward situation for her, too, and that there’s no right way to approach a situation like that – but as I found, there is a wrong one.As the former CBeebies presenter Cerrie Burnell noted when she was faced with parents complaining that their children were scared of her arm, it is a parent’s job to explain to their children about disabilities and the differences between people rather than making disabled people feel uncomfortable for simply existing.Unfortunately, the incident on the train was not the first time something like this has happened to me. Once, in a supermarket, my arm was grabbed from behind by a stranger who wanted to show me he had an arm similar to mine. I always find meeting amputees interesting, especially seeing how they deal with everyday tasks differently to me but the fact that the man did not even speak to me, just waved his arm in my face and walked off, made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. The fact that he did not realise – or worse – did not care how intrusive it is to have a part of your body grabbed by a stranger worries me, even if it was similar to his.The topic of consent has rightly moved to the forefront of much of the public discourse regarding how we interact with others – it should be extended to encompass disabled people too. While I’d never equate what happened to me with sexual assault, the basic fundamentals of consent and bodily autonomy remain the same, regardless of disability, and it is essential that we, as disabled people, are afforded agency over our own bodies.• Devarshi Lodhia is a freelance journalist with an interest in sports, film, and music"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906278105bddc0dc05efab1beeb12416420c623f/1_0_4610_2767/master/4610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031245c7e3293643f471ef51e7717fbb","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

Go-to order: the clam pizza.SpuntinoTheir food is incredible, but it’s super-passionate owner Elliot Strathmann’s knowledge of digestifs and aperitifs that makes Spuntino. He has a vintage collection of spirits, and if you’re nice enough to him he’ll let you sample some really old Italian amaros.Ratio BeerworksThis is an awesome microbrewery, with a beautiful patio right on Larimer Street. Rather than focus on fringe, crazy varieties, they make the sort of easy-drinking beers that Denver is really loving right now.Western Daughters Butcher ShoppeWhat sustainable, local food should be. If you’re looking to buy meat in Denver, I don’t think anybody does it better than Western Daughters.

Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each?

Take your pick: the gay panic undertones roiling over at the k-happy Omega house, the set piece in which the lovable louts of Delta house bring some ladies to an Otis Day show only to scamper away yelping that “the Negroes stole our dates”, John Belushi’s conspiratorial eyebrow waggle through the fourth wall as he peeps on a half-naked sorority girl. Not to mention one particularly queasy sequence in which meek Pinto (Thomas Hulce) debates with the angel and devil on his shoulders over whether he should rape a passed-out teenybopper. He ultimately decides against it, but it’s a pretty close call. Forty years out from the initial release, it would seem that the chronicle of Faber College’s most hilariously chaotic year on the books just wasn’t made for these times, to crib a phrase. But there’s a lucid, fully-formed ideology behind all the liquor-soused antics, and it’s surprisingly well-suited to the bitter, fractious, jaded America of the present. Beneath every historical interlude of hedonism lies a foundation of nihilism, and the Deltas’ gleeful anti-everything ethic looks frightfully familiar in a modernity reaching a critical mass of disgusted cynicism. It’s easy to point at the film’s transgressions and conclude that Animal House has not “aged well,” but in the meanwhile, its attitude has curdled back into relevance. If anything hasn’t aged well, it’s morale in the United States.Though the script skewers nostalgia by setting itself in the not-so-innocent yesteryear of 1962, in spirit, Faber College’s stately campus is situated squarely in the post-hippie, pre-Reagan moment. The National Lampoon rejected the failed peace-and-love utopia of the flower children, and blanched at the slick-haired sycophants that would go on to form the yuppie class during the 80s. (You can almost see the undergrads at the Omega house going on to slobber at the Armani-loafered feet of Wall Street’s Gordon Gekko.) The Deltas extend equal contempt to the moral deformities in their rival frat and anyone cornball enough to believe in something. All it takes for a red-blooded young man to ingratiate himself with the coeds from Emily Dickinson College is claiming to be into folk music and “women’s lib” Belushi smashing the Peter, Paul and Mary castoff’s guitar offers a bracing, cathartic symbol for the expulsion of the counterculture’s remaining vestiges. Fully abandoning any formal credo leaves a person with the options to despair or embrace it, and the Deltas advance the latter choice to its sloppy logical conclusion. Fat, drunk and stupid may be no way to go through life, but it certainly takes the edge off. They rebel against a world they want nothing to do with through partying, insulating themselves from the mellow-harshing responsibilities of adult life by remaining in college indefinitely.It’s a potent weltanschauung at a time marked by a disillusionment unseen in such severity since real life broke the rose-colored promise of the LSD droppers. The constant news ticker of atrocities running over the past couple of years has left many Americans withdrawn while far from apathetic. An exhaustion with the status quo split both major political parties into pieces, and gave way to candidates pushing further to the left and right than ever before. An unexpectedly expansive faction of voters moved away from the two-party system entirely, united in their inability to find any figure worth their support in the establishment. Anti-establishment-ism just so happens to be the one principle that Animal House dares to get behind. The Deltas are staunch in their opposition to every form the Man might take, from a humorless dean to the local authorities. It doesn’t take much of a stretch for a viewer in 2018 to find some satisfaction in a film that offers personal pleasure as the primary act of resistance against a world of assorted bullshit. Bluto, Pinto, weaselly Otter, galumphing Flounder, all the half-wasted slackers that Animal House dared to put forth as heroes – their code of conduct belongs in a less mindful past, but their philosophy was ahead of its time. Pre-med or pre-law, it’s all the same thing to Otter, who’s ided life beyond Faber into polite society’s compromised professionals and the pure honesty of no longer giving a damn. If Animal House can make a viewer in the present pine for the good ol’ days, it’ll be for the time when it was a bit simpler and safer to stop caring. Once upon a time, the stakes were low enough that America’s youth could afford the luxury of blithe non-participation without fascism sneaking in behind them. Their rallying cry? “Toga! Toga! Toga!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9ddc86503906c5af7ac3ee7f22f3e4e8a49d90d/302_64_5264_3158/master/5264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04c0b60d2caf5a1e3f8cd52c850ff347","title":"jurgen klopp sergio ramos ruthless brutal champions league final liverpool real madrid","story":"• Liverpool manager says Ramos tackled Salah ‘like a wrestler’• Alisson move unrelated to Champions League final outcomeJürgen Klopp has opened up on Liverpool’s Champions League final defeat for the first time and described Sergio Ramos as acting like a brutal wrestler when injuring Mohamed Salah in Kiev. Liverpool would still have signed Alisson for a world-record goalkeeping fee had they beaten Real Madrid in May, Klopp confirmed.The Liverpool manager accused Ramos of deliberately targeting Salah and Loris Karius, who suffered concussion moments before gifting Karim Benzema the opening goal, and the referee Milorad Mazic of lacking the courage to dismiss the Real captain in such a high-profile fixture. Klopp had previously kept his counsel on the decisive incidents in Kiev but did not hold back when pressed again on Liverpool’s US tour, insisting Ramos’s history of controversy requires greater scrutiny.“We are opening that bottle again?” said Klopp, speaking before Saturday’s International Champions Cup game against Manchester United. “It is action-reaction-action-reaction and I don’t like that but – if you watch it back and you are not with Real Madrid – then you think it is ruthless and brutal.“I saw the ref taking charge of big games at the World Cup and nobody really thinks about that later. But in a situation like that somebody needs to judge it better. If VAR is coming then it is a situation where you have to look again. Not to give a red card but to look again and say: ‘What is that?’ It was ruthless.He added: “We are aggressive but I always use the word ‘legal as well’. Usually if you try something you will get punished. Someone will see it and ban you for four or five weeks. But in this example, no one. This ref should have had the courage to decide that game. In this situation we didn’t get it and, if you write this, people will say I am weak or a bad loser or a whiner. I am not. I accept it. It’s not like I wake up in the morning and think: ‘Ramos!’Klopp knew Liverpool would be accused of making excuses for defeat by disclosing Karius tested positive for concussion several days after the final but insisted the club had no option but to make the diagnosis public. However, he confirmed, also for the first time, that Liverpool would have pursued the £65m deal for Alisson irrespective of Karius’s display in Kiev.Liverpool inquired about the Brazil international in January and Klopp added: “We didn’t use the concussion as an excuse for one second but how can we not put it out as an explanation? The problem is only now that people still don’t believe it, and then we bring in a new goalkeeper and people think we don’t believe it as well, which is not true.José Mourinho has claimed there is a demand on Liverpool to win the title having spent more than £170m on new players this summer. The United manager also said it was funny Klopp had invested heavily having previously objected to extravagant transfer fees. “I heard he was smiling when he said it and he found it funny,” said the Liverpool manager, “so I am really happy that José is smiling. It doesn’t happen often.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d3e05b0571fe4ef7de528f6e55c2af73041ed9c/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad399ffe7eb5c643ee00e86fa037995e","title":"a letter to the mother whose child i just removed","story":"‘I know how deeply you love him… But I also know you cannot keep him safe’: the letter you always wanted to writeAs the judge announces his ruling that your child will now be placed for adoption, you let out a wail of anguish and break into floods of tears.

But not this one...Negotiating the well-heeled streets of Sandbanks involves weaving around many builders’ vans. In this redevelopment hotspot near Poole, Dorset, many\u0026nbspold houses with\u0026nbspmature gardens are being ripped out and replaced with ultra-modern homes\u0026nbspskirted by artificial grass and gravel. But Pam Woodall has rebelled by creating a garden that’s packed with wildlife – and is anything but low maintenance.Her garden is ided into two sections: an immaculate terrace spreads out from the back of the house, leading to a well-tended lawn ended by the full stop of a hugely tall, fat-trunked maritime pine, Pinus pinaster. So far, so lovely – but there’s a\u0026nbspsurprise beyond that pine. The plot plunges down into a lush dell garden that acts as an unofficial extension to the Luscombe Valley nature reserve that lies behind it. “We call it the jungle, but it is like a secret garden,” Woodall says.After a career working as an economic journalist and living in flats in London, New York and Hong Kong, this was her first real garden. It’s been a\u0026nbsphuge success, winning the BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine garden of the year 2016 award for best wildlife garden. When Woodall, now retired, bought the house with her husband Dave in 2013, the lower garden was impenetrable: thick with brambles and rhododendrons, and littered with old furniture and plastic rubbish. Given the scale of the task, she was tempted to leave it alone and concentrate on the garden nearer the house. So what persuaded her otherwise? Her sister offered encouragement, but Woodall thinks it’s also partly a reaction to what’s happening in her neighbourhood. “I hate the way these mature gardens, which are great for wildlife, are being destroyed,” she explains. “It’s my slightly rebellious side wanting to stand up against that.”Two years of clearance followed, revealing the remains of a long-neglected woodland garden. Woodall painstakingly dug out four ponds to give the boggy ground somewhere to drain, and to attract aquatic life. She used logs and twigs from the clearance to build paths between the ponds and mark out tiers and steps. Aside from the obvious environmental considerations, the garden’s steep slope was a strong motivator to recycle as much waste within the garden as possible, rather than hauling it away. While this may seem like a gargantuan task to most, Woodall took it in her stride: “I like the creation of the garden, the work. And gardening is the best workout you can get. I\u0026nbspdon’t need a gym membership.”She begged plants from friends and family to begin filling the slopes with moisture-loving, insect-attracting, colourful flowers that don’t need deadheading and thrive in the dappled shade astilbes with their pink or white, feathery, plume-like flowers, dark purple Salvia ‘Amistad’, orange crocosmias and deep-ink schizostylis, the crimson flag lily. While the flowers are the beautiful face of the garden, dead and decaying wood is just as important in attracting wildlife, such as the most spectacular member of the invertebrate world, the stag beetle. Ivy-swagged tree stumps remain in situ as homes for bats, birds and insects, and the copious pine cones and fallen branches were piled into dead hedges and crafted into more fancy insect residences. This is certainly no low-maintenance garden. Woodall spends many hours a week gardening, making sure the balance between a usable, beautiful garden and a wilderness is maintained, because she knows “the sad truth is, if I decided to stop gardening, the brambles would move in”.And what does the rest of Sandbanks make of it? “Most people here have gardeners, so when they see me working in my scruffy clothes, I\u0026nbspthink they think I am the gardener,” Woodall notes wryly. “Our neighbours think the garden is wonderful, but they’re a bit puzzled.” Don’t cut back in autumn Leave seedheads and other plant material over winter (remove in spring), providing food for birds and shelter for invertebrates.Accept that a wildlife garden will have messy areas Woodall recommends making “untidy” areas look attractive by putting architectural plants such as Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera manicata) and tree ferns in front of them to draw the eye.Water is essential, providing homes for insects and amphibians and a water hole for birds and\u0026nbspmammals. Make sure there are plenty of platforms and different levels, so hedgehogs and birds have a place to drink, and amphibians have a spot to bask.Plant shrubs that offer year-round food supplies, such as cotoneaster and ivy berries. Deep borders also offer cover for birds who may be reluctant to fly into an exposed garden to feed.Compost heaps aren’t just great places to recycle garden waste: they are home to wildlife, too. Woodall’s six heaps host slow worms and grass snakes. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

This is not Jameela Jamil.“We cannot talk in here, it’s too fucking crowded,” Jamil, the former T4 presenter turned US sitcom star, declares, looking around the private members’ club. I’d suggested it because it’s near what is now her home in West Hollywood, which she shares with her boyfriend of three years, the musician James Blake. But as we walk through the club she decrees it “a bit you know, whatever, you know what I mean?” All around us, people are wearing the regulation outfits of LA beautiful people: long dresses with sandals, or designer jeans with vintage T-shirts and expensive trainers. Jamil, by contrast, is wearing an absurdly short and tight dress with chunky heels. Her hair and makeup look endearingly unpolished.“I like to do it myself, because I don’t like being contoured,” she says, referring to the makeup trick that creates the illusion of a thinner face and higher cheekbones, popularised by Kim Kardashian, who we’ll get to in a minute. “Also, I invariably get made up to look a different ethnicity – whiter.” If the former breakfast TV presenter Cat Deeley looked born and bred in Santa Monica five minutes after landing here to present So You Think You Can Dance, Jamil still looks like a London girl on her way to Camden Market.Most British people still know Jamil best from her time as a presenter on Radio 1, and her three-year stint on pop culture show T4, from 2009, where she was a fun and lively interviewer who, for example, informed Russell Brand live on air that interviewing him was “a nightmare”. But in the US she has become a bona fide star, thanks to her role in NBC’s The Good Place, made by the people behind Parks And Recreation. Set in the afterlife and co-starring Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, The Good Place is one of those rare shows that manages to be very smart and extremely silly, in which extended discussions about Kierkegaard and Plato (as the characters try to figure out if they’re good or bad) rub up against jokes about Blue Ivy and James Franco. Jamil is very funny as Tahani, a Little Miss Perfect socialite who namedrops for Britain: “I haven’t been this upset since my good friend Taylor was rudely upstaged by my other good friend Kanye, who was defending my best friend, Beyoncé.” The show has just finished shooting its third season.After a breast cancer scare at the age of 28, Jamil decided she would no longer wait to do the things she wanted to do. So she moved to LA in 2015, originally hoping to find work as a screenwriter. To her surprise, her manager convinced her to audition for The Good Place instead and, even though she had never acted before, she got the part. Initially, she begged the show’s creator, Michael Schur, to rethink his decision, “because I didn’t want to make an absolute tit of myself in front of the entire world”. Like Tom Haverford, the character in Parks And Recreation played by an Indian-American actor (Aziz Ansari) but portrayed on the show as simply American, Jamil, whose parents are Indian and Pakistani, plays a character who is defined by her Englishness her ethnicity is not an issue. Similarly, the two young male leads are played by an African-American (William Jackson Harper) and a Filipino-Canadian (Manny Jacinto), and in neither case is their ethnicity a bar to them having on-screen romances with women from other backgrounds. It’s not so much colourblind casting as colour-neutral, an extreme rarity in mainstream US TV.“There was a moment when we were filming season one when I realised I was in a scene with two other women from south Asian backgrounds, and it wasn’t commented on in the show or anything,” Jamil says. “And we were all shocked by this, for our race to not be fetishised in some way, and we were shocked by how shocked we were.”Meanwhile, Jamil has taken on another high-profile role, that of an extremely vocal critic of celebrity culture. She started an Instagram account called I Weigh on which women post images of themselves and say how much they “weigh” – not in kilos, but in the qualities they like about themselves (“Good friend”, “Bad singer”, “Loving sister”, and so on.) She made headlines earlier this year when she criticised Kim Kardashian for promoting something called an “appetite suppressant lollipop”. “Fuck off. You terrible and toxic influence on young girls,” Jamil wrote on Twitter. Kardashian later deleted the post.On her blog, Jamil often takes the extremely unusual step – for a celebrity – of calling out journalists and fellow actors by name: “Some awful woman called Heidi Parker for the Daily Mail Online has written an article, appearance shaming a heavily, heavily pregnant Jessica Biel,” begins one typical entry. She wrote a smart take on the Aziz Ansari scandal, after the comedian was accused of having pressured a date into having sex, and linked a lack of interest in female consent with the rising availability of porn. (As it happens, Jamil shares a manager with Ansari.)She has plenty of reasons to be critical of the British tabloid press: when she started on T4, the papers criticised her for being too thin. Then, when she gained weight after taking steroids for her asthma, she was criticised for being too fat the tabloids published unflattering pictures of her bending over in the street.“Outside my house! To pick up my keys! And then photos of my arse are in magazines – it’s so invasive, it should be illegal. But it really opened my eyes, because when I was a size 6 or 8, they only took photos of me that would make me look good, posing on the red carpet or whatever. As soon as I was a size 10, they only want photos of you looking bad, like, with your mouth open or eyes closed. No one tried to take my photo when I was running when I was thin, only when I was fat,” she says, just getting started.She was considered fat at a size 10? “Yes! Seriously, come on. But what really upset me was that they never documented any of my professional success, such as that I was the first woman to host the chart show on Radio 1. It was always about my failure to fulfil some Victoria’s Secret prototype.”Jamil now has a rule: that she doesn’t want any images of herself to be airbrushed. In this, she is one of a new generation of women speaking out against the artifice of celebrity photography: last year, Lupita Nyong’o criticised Grazia magazine for removing her afro ponytail and Solange Knowles complained when the Evening Standard magazine removed her crown of braids. But I tell Jamil she’s the first person I’ve encountered who forbids any retouching.“Really?” she says, surprised. “I don’t know any woman who’s truly happy with how they look, because they’re always aspiring to this perfect aesthetic, and I just find it really toxic and I’ve had enough. I did a tweet recently about a tabloid that described Queen Latifah as looking like a ‘beached whale’ – can you imagine?” I can, and I add that disrespecting Queen Latifah – with her decades of success – seems absurd, like disrespecting Oprah Winfrey. Jamil cocks a slightly sceptical eyebrow. “I mean, to be fair, Oprah does a lot of weight-loss endorsements, so part of Oprah’s industry is her weight-loss fluctuations, so that’s different.”The sad truth is that many of these articles and magazines are written and edited by women. “Even if a woman edits the magazine, a man owns the company and I think it’s scary to men how independent women can be,” says Jamil. “It’s not in the patriarchy’s interest for us to be multifaceted. They want us to worry about how we look, because it slows us down and we’re then less likely to overtake them. Also, it benefits me to show what I really look like, because then there’s no value in tabloid photos of me. People are used to seeing my wrinkles and spots and under-eye circles, so the paparazzi can’t ‘catch me out’,” she says, placing heavy sarcasm on the last three words.It’s easy to be bold about showing your true face to the world when it is as naturally gorgeous as Jamil’s in person, her big brown eyes, long, messy black hair and curvy figure make her look almost cartoonishly beautiful. And on her Instagram account, she posts plenty of flattering selfies. “I’m all for wearing nice clothes and enjoying yourself, but that’s just a fraction of the things I’m interested in,” she says. “I make sure I put my writing out there and my campaigning, and I hope the image I’ve projected is a rounded one.” She is looking down and speaking more quietly than before, as if she’s still figuring it all out. Does it really help girls and women to be told to feel better about themselves when the person doing the telling looks like a model? Jamil winces a little, because she doesn’t see it like that. She talks about her “unsexy personality” and “total clumsiness”, which would come across a little like Miss America insisting they’re actually super-dorky because they wear glasses had Jamil not experienced so much bullying about her appearance as a child.Whether about her weight, or her skin colour, the bullying went on for as long as she can remember. By the age of 12, she was 5ft 10in and big for her age, her face covered in acne and braces, and at her private all-girls school in London (she was on a scholarship), it was relentless. “They called me the Fat Paki,” she recalls.But that’s not even a pun!“I know, it’s like my early rap name.”As recently as 2016, she was racially abused in London. “I was in Notting Hill the day after the referendum and someone said, ‘Go home, Paki!’ The day after! I was like, ‘How long have you been waiting to say that, mate?’” she says, both amused and furious.When she was 14, Jamil developed an eating disorder that she now sees as an attempt to gain some control over a life that felt chaotic, and to fit in with the girls at school ,“although it didn’t help”. She credits a major accident with changing the course of her life – she was 17 when a car hit her, damaging her spine. She was stuck in bed for a year and thought she’d never be able to walk again without a Zimmer frame. “There’s something about not being able to move that gives you a new respect for your body, and I honestly think that accident saved me.”Throughout all this, Jamil’s home life was difficult her parents were unhappily married and orced when she was very young. She was also sexually assaulted by strangers twice. The first time happened when she was 12 and walking along Oxford Street when a man grabbed her by the crotch. “At 3.30 in the afternoon in front of John Lewis, for God’s sake,” she near shouts. When he wouldn’t let go, she had to run down the street and throw herself against a wall to shake him off, then run away. When she was 15, she was dragged by a stranger into a car – “in Belsize Park! The most affluent part of London!” – and was saved only because a stranger saw her struggling. “I never considered those experiences traumatic until now, because I thought they happened to everyone and were normal. And now I realise that maybe that’s true, but it shouldn’t be.”This realisation has emboldened her to speak out against the movie industry. Jamil feels some things have improved, thanks to the #MeToo movement: “weird and sleazy producers” no longer suggest meetings at 9pm and men don’t even try to hug, let alone kiss her, at the end of a meeting. But the situation is far from perfect. Jamil is close friends with Daniele Bernfeld, a movie executive who was viciously assaulted by the actor Emile Hirsch in 2015 Hirsch was given a fine and sentenced to 15 days in jail. “But he’s never stopped working – meanwhile, my friend has PTSD,” Jamil says with palpable fury. Hirsch is now making Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino’s film about the Charles Manson murders – a film about the death of a woman, Sharon Tate, directed by a man who has admitted he knew that Harvey Weinstein assaulted women, co-starring a man who assaulted a woman.“It is so dark. How dare any of the people involved in that movie wear Time’s Up pins to the Golden Globes? Can people just not hire men who have almost killed women?” she says.And yet, there are plenty of women who, at the very least, play down male violence. Not long before Jamil and I meet, Germaine Greer, for reasons known only to her, told an audience at the Hay festival: “Instead of thinking of rape as a spectacularly violent crime – and some rapes are – think about it as non-consensual, that is bad sex.”“Bloody, bloody Germaine Greer!” Jamil shouts, startling everyone around us. “Rape is not bad sex. She just needs to get in the bin and live there and set up shop there. And the older French women!” she adds, referring to the letter 100 French women, including Catherine Deneuve, signed, condemning the #MeToo campaign for its “hatred of men and sexuality”.“I wonder if older women look back and realise they’ve experienced trauma and want us to stop talking about it, because they don’t want to think about it. But we’re just trying to stop it happening to the next generation of girls,” she says.Does Jamil ever worry that being outspoken might hurt her career?“Oh, I don’t care about that. I can’t not say this because then you become a double agent for the patriarchy, which has always been my greatest fear.”And yet one awkward fact remains: that her manager is Dave Becky, who is not only Ansari’s manager, but also the former manager of Louis CK, who admitted to sexual misconduct last year. Becky was accused by two of CK’s victims of telling them not to talk about it, and later issued a public apology.“He’s no longer Louis CK’s manager,” she says with a nervous laugh. “But I decided to be with him because he represents so many women I admire.” (Becky also represents Amy Poehler, Issa Rae and Natasha Lyonne.)And neither he nor Schur ever warned her off talking about Ansari?Almost every feminist is familiar with the idea of making a compromise to get on in the modern world, and if you work in the entertainment business you are more familiar than most. And if there are certain elements Jamil is still figuring out, no one can doubt her courage in doing this just as she embarks on her Hollywood career.Her boyfriend, James Blake, has been a huge source of support. They knew each other in London, but got together when they moved to LA at the same time. “Living with him has been very settling for me,” she says. And in turn her campaigning has been eye-opening for Blake: “He’s seen the impact of making yourself a voice of reason to the people you’re lucky enough to reach.”There is an obvious irony in that it took coming to LA, in many ways the global epicentre of body neuroses and abuse enablement, to turn Jamil into a warrior on behalf of women’s self-image and safety at work. But she says it was being here that pushed her over the edge. And, put like that, it’s depressing that more women haven’t had that reaction, too.“I just cannot stay silent any more, I can’t,” she says. “I don’t care if I’m going down – I’m going down in flames. I’m fine to not work in this industry. But I’m not fine to not say something.”• The Good Place returns to Netflix in the autumnCommenting on this piece?

What’s different about the things that children laugh at, and how can we help them laugh more? It’s well known that if you pull humour apart, you can kill it stone dead. But I’m going to risk a bit of a dissection in the hope that my personal angle into what tickles kids will help you create more laughter.I start here: children (whether they are much loved and also if they are not) experience the world as people with very little power. As parents, most of us tell ourselves this is all for the good, because we are wiser and more knowledgable than they are. The power gap is inescapable. But, of course, as we exert our power, telling children we are right, right, right, we say and do crazy, illogical things, inconsistent things and, sometimes, horrible things.In other words, we are a bit wrong, quite a lot wrong or totally wrong. What’s more, children quite often resist us, so that we are unable to exert that power. Then there are places that children can escape to – in their minds or with their friends – where adult power can’t reach.All this is fertile territory for making them laugh (the source, if you like): moments of authoritarianism gone wrong daft acts of resistance inappropriate line-crossing and taboo-breaking.If you want to discover how to make children laugh – and I truly believe all adults should, because children need laughter – the best place to start is with your own childhood. For me, the core memory is that we were a family that treasured hilarity.I was the youngest, and there was my mother, my father and my brother. They each had their own way of turning anything, from washing up an eggcup to a chase across the North York Moors to catch up with a train, into a comic account. I’m not sure why they did this but if, as Charlie Chaplin directs us, we should look for comedy’s origins in pain, then I can find some of that in my mother’s unspoken loss of a child, my father’s ever-absent father and my brother’s sense that he couldn’t live up to our own father’s expectations.I watched them playing this stuff out in everyday life but, alongside this, there were the books, films and plays that made us all laugh and that were then recycled and remixed into the family sagas and gags. All this made me happy then, makes me happy now and, sometime in the mid-1960s, made me think that I could join in: that I could have a go at writing and performing this stuff, too.As I began to perform – songs, poems, sketches or conjuring tricks – I began to learn what children run with and what they don’t. I discovered that, quite often, an element of surprise or absurdity might be the key to unlocking laughter. Perhaps the way I would say, “Mm?” or the way I played with my eyebrows. I started collecting these, almost as if I was collecting bits of costume. I added them to snatches of dialogue, real, invented, exaggerated or whatever, which if you perform them, get the timing right, seem to work every time.Here’s one that I do: “One time I got into trouble. You know the sort of thing… like… say… I’m in the bedroom and I’m sitting on my brother’s head for half an hour. My dad comes in and he shouts, ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ And I say, ‘I’m sitting on my brother’s head for half an hour.’ And he says, ‘I can see that!’ And I say, ‘Well, if you can see it, why are you asking me?’”When the laughter comes, I hear relief. The father here is trying to control the situation but is losing control. And a child-audience supports the child, asking: “If you can see it, why are you asking me?” The child has exposed the absurdity of what the dad just said.I think at the heart of this laughter is an anxiety born of that lack of power children experience. There are plenty of other areas to explore through this type of humour: worries about what we look like or sound like worries about achievement (perceived lack of) worries about “Am I good enough?” worries about family foibles worries even about illness and death.I found I could play on this anxiety and use it by assuming the role of a child (or the adult behaving like a child) who can’t stop himself doing daft things. This child (or daft adult) might be motivated by greed, ambition or the need to create fantasies at the very moment he should be keeping focused on what’s going on. When children laugh at this, they can feel superior to the silliness of the child I am playing. Again, this is relief: as if they are saying to themselves, “I am not as silly as that boy Michael Rosen was.” Or, “That’s the sort of thing I do thank goodness people are laughing at him for doing that, and not me.” Comedy can act like a lightning rod to channel the anxiety away.Some of the best moments come out of what we might call the transgressive anecdote from our own lives. Any encounter, any situation in which there was a confrontation between us as children and our own parents, or teachers, when we did something daft, can arouse amazement and delight in our children. There’s something wonderful about knowing that our own parents were fallible.People always talk about the timing of jokes, but in a family setup, it’s not so much the timing itself as the time you tell it. Persistent joke-telling is a bore. The trick is to hold the jokes you know for the moment when they will work. I collect joke books and cartoon books, and have always given them to my children. I’ve even written one. Hearing children reading jokes to each other is a treat.Making children laugh isn’t terribly difficult. You just have to understand where the laughter is coming from, and why it’s necessary in a child’s development. I’m no scientist, neurologist or psychologist, but I know it helps them find their way in life, because a child’s world is full of pomposity, rules, BS, notices, announcements, lists, predictable patterns of speech, people pretending to be certain when they’re not.And this is all quite apart from the whole barrage of spin, deceit, fakery and the overblown nonsense of advertising, self-publicity and political chicanery. It is our duty as adults to spend time redressing this power balance by puncturing all of it – with wordplay, inversions, bad puns, altered names and mashups.Enjoy.• How To Make Children Laugh, by Michael Rosen, is published by Quercus at £9.99.

Can our novice cut it?I lied when they asked if I had ever used a chainsaw before. “A few times, but I think it’s been a while,” I said. This even seemed as if it might be true, until I got within arm’s reach of a purring 7.8 horsepower saw. Then I realised: I would have remembered.Spike Milton, my trainer, runs me through the machine’s many safety features. “This one is, to my mind, the most important,” he says, pointing to a sticker indicating that goggles and ear defenders must be worn. That may be his favourite safety feature, but I prefer the brake that stops me accidentally sawing my head in half.I’m already wearing goggles and ear defenders, along with chainmail leggings under Kevlar chaps, with the Mediterranean sun bearing down on my neck. I practise holding the saw, starting the saw, and then stopping the saw. Finally, I’m permitted to cut a disc – a cookie, they call it – from the end of a 40cm-diameter log. My cookie looks more like a cake slice: fat at the top, tapering to nothing at the bottom. British champion Simon Bond demonstrates the correct technique, cutting one, then coming up from underneath to cut another, in mere seconds. I don’t imagine there’s a page in the safety manual where it says, “Remember: always saw as fast as you can”, but that’s how they do things here.Welcome to the world of competitive woodchopping, a sport with an atmosphere somewhere between a cage fight and a Formula One race: big men, loud music, screaming engines and exhaust fumes hanging in the air. And sawdust. Lots of sawdust.This year’s Timbersports Champions Trophy is being held, somewhat incongruously, on the harbour front in Marseille, next to an always turning, ever empty Ferris wheel. Here, 12 national champions from 11 countries (there are two Italians) are about to take up axes and saws in a standalone competition, essentially a warm-up for the world championships in Liverpool in October. Although the British championships happen every summer in conjunction with the BBC’s Countryfile Live event, this will be the first time the world championships have come to the UK.At sunset, a cheering crowd fills the stands they’re mostly locals here to support Frenchman Pierre Puybaret, though there are also a few Czech flags being waved. It’s not clear how many of the audience of 800 or so are woodchopping aficionados – a lot seem to have bought tickets at the gate – but they’ve been amply supplied with French flags bearing the Timbersports logo.Two presenters provide a steady stream of bilingual inanities between heats. Competitors emerge from a tunnel beneath bleachers in pairs, through a smoke machine cloud, accompanied by snatches of ACDC, Guns N’ Roses and the White Stripes. Onstage, with the 17th-century tower of Fort Saint-Jean looming behind them, they start their chainsaws and place them on the ground, where they judder and twist out of position. Adopting a sort of racing crouch, the two men place their hands atop their logs, as if in prayer.“Stand to your timber!” an announcer shouts. On the word go, contenders snatch up their saws. When the race is over a minute and a half later, crew members armed with leaf blowers clear the stage of sawdust. Cut logs are carted away and new ones installed.A referee later tells me that the preparatory cry of, “Stand to your timber!” is new for this season in previous years, the announcer shouted, “Hands on the wood!” If they were looking for something less unintentionally suggestive, they found something virtually meaningless: competitors never do anything that could be described as standing to their timber. But they’re stuck with it for now: the voice is a recording, synchronised with the official timer.The umbrella term applied to the sport – a set of disciplines derived from timber industry work – varies. Woodchopping is the word they use in Australia and New Zealand, but it’s also referred to as lumberjack sports or logging sports. Timbersports (the name is a registered trademark of Stihl, the German chainsaw company that sponsors the series) is a streamlined offering from the traditional lumberjack skillset – no log-rolling here – with just six disciplines. In fact, the Champions Trophy competition is really a single event. After dropping the chainsaw, competitors dash across the stage to chop through a 32cm-diameter log while standing on it. Then it’s back to the first log to saw through it again, this time by hand. Finally, they must chop horizontally through a standing block – a vertical log held in what looks like a big Christmas tree stand. The current world record for this one-man relay is 57 seconds.Chopping up logs for sport may sound like a novelty, but it is not new. The first competitive woodchopping event was held in Latrobe, Tasmania, in 1891. It has a similar, parallel history in Canada and the US. The Lumberjack World Championships have been held in Wisconsin every year since 1960, and were televised in the US in the 1970s. Smaller competitions are long-established features of rural shows just about anywhere that has a history of logging.“In Australia, if you really wanted to, you could compete every weekend,” says Mitch Argent, a member of the Australian national team, the Chopperoos. Timbersports’ promotional material stresses the athleticism of the contenders, but their physiques range from large and impressive to big and doughy. These days, most of the top competitors follow tailored fitness regimes to build strength and endurance, but not all. “I don’t think I’ve ever been to the gym in my life,” Argent says. “If you’re woodchopping, I think the best way to train for it is to chop wood.”The age range also varies considerably. Argent and Bond are both in their mid-20s, but routinely compete against men twice their age. The best, however, seem to have two things in common: a generational connection to the sport, and easy access to wood. Bond, the British champion from north Wales, currently works on a logging gang in New Zealand. Argent’s father, a former competitor, still supplies all the chopping blocks for Queensland shows.Most choppers have specialist events, but to win the Champions Trophy, you’ve got to be good at everything. Of the four core disciplines that comprise the race, the single buck saw, sometimes known as the “misery whip”, is reckoned to be the hardest to master. “It’s the most technically difficult,” Bond says, “because there’s so much that can go wrong with it.”The single buck looks like a 6ft two-man saw with one of the handles removed. The blade weighs more than a stone, with long teeth designed to cut deep in both directions. A combination of strength and technique is required to operate one, which is possibly why I can’t. No matter how hard I pull – or push – the saw will not move.“Find the balance,” Milton tells me. A former competitor and now Timbersports’ global director of sport, Milton has a manner somewhere between a scoutmaster and a driving instructor, displaying a patience that I fail to emulate. The trick, he explains, is to find the exact angle that allows the blade to draw. As I pull, he reaches out and adjusts the height of the handle. Suddenly, the blade moves. As soon as he lets go, it stops.After several aborted attempts, I begin to grasp the principle, if not the skill. It’s exhausting and frustrating work. To make things worse, I’m being watched by a knot of French schoolchildren on a trip to the museum next door. Milton will not give up on me, although I very much wish he would. “You can do it,” he says. He repeats this every time the blade jams, forward and back, until it becomes incantatory. Halfway through the log, I realise he means to make me complete the cut. I’m out of breath, lightheaded and dripping with sweat. My arms feel like empty sleeves. I push the saw. It buckles and pushes back.“You can do it,” Milton says. Eventually, after about a quarter of an hour, the cookie drops to the floor. The current record is 9.39 seconds.Milton won’t let me try either of the axe events, and for that I am grateful. The axes, they say, are sharp enough to shave with. The underhand chop, in particular, looks an easy way to lose a foot.Competitors tend to play down the obvious risks. “Accidents happen in every sport,” Bond says. “But if you’re one of these top 12 guys that are here now, they’re all so proficient at it, you don’t think about the danger.”“I think I’ve seen one person cut himself ever,” Argent says.Stirling Hart, the 29-year-old Canadian champion, has a scar running from the outer corner of his right eye down to his lower lip, from an injury he received at an event in Australia in 2011. “I must have hit an artery right here,” he says, pointing to his cheek. “It was like the knight’s arm in Monty Python And The Holy Grail.”The event was the springboard, in which competitors axe a notch in a pole, jam a plank into the notch, climb on to it, and cut another, higher notch. It ends when you’ve cut through a block fixed to the top of the pole while standing on the second board. Hart holds the world record for this event (35.67 seconds), but back in 2011 the axe fell from where he’d stuck it and the blade grazed him on the way down. “I figured it was the back of the axe that hit me, so I just kind of gave my head a shake,” he says. “Then I could see blood all over my hands. I thought, ‘That’s not ideal.’”The scar has since become something of a trademark. “I get recognised everywhere I go,” he says, “which can be a good thing or a bad thing. But yeah, the sport is dangerous.”Woodchopping originated when lumberjacks turned their day job into a weekend hobby, but it remains very difficult for today’s competitors to turn their hobby into a job. The equipment, specially designed for competition, is expensive: a “racing” axe will set you back £400, and most choppers own dozens in different weights. A single buck saw costs about £1,700. A hot saw – a custom-built, high-tuned chainsaw with 10 times the horsepower of a standard model – sells for up to £8,000. Prize money and sponsorship can offset the investment, but nobody’s in it to get rich.Backstage in Marseille, in the hours before showtime, competitors mark up the logs they’ve been allotted in a draw, scrutinising the rings on the cut face. To be successful in this sport requires more than strong arms and a sharp axe you have to know a lot about wood. I ask the American qualifier, Arden Cogar, if the European timber presents any particular challenges for him.“It’s very abrasive on the equipment,” he says. “The poplar, actually it’s a cottonwood species, and it sucks silica up into the phloem, which is the heart of the tree. And that silica is sand, and that causes the razor edge on the axe to be just frayed.” I don’t know what I thought he was going to say, but I didn’t expect his answer to have the word phloem in it.A malpractice litigation attorney from West Virginia with an impressive gut, a bald head and a goatee beard, Cogar belongs to what the New Yorker once described as the first family of competitive lumberjacking. “My father, five paternal uncles and about 20 members of my family competed in the sport,” he says. His cousin, Matthew, has won the US Timbersports championship five times since he took the title from Arden in 2013.The Cogars host their own annual competition, the Webster County Woodchopping festival, started by Cogar’s father in 1960, which he now runs and which he is missing, for the first time in his life, in order to compete in Marseille. Cogar also has the distinction of being, at 48, the oldest of the 12 finalists (the youngest is 21). When he finished first in his time trial heat, he shouted, “Power to the old fat people!” He is hoping his long-honed technique will compensate for his extra years. “I do not have to think about it,” he says. “The only time in my life that I am thoughtless is when I have an axe in my hands.”The amount of wood required for competition is of another order: 12 tonnes just for this weekend – competition blocks for every heat of every event, plus spares and testing logs. The trees are industrial hybrids, with trunks that grow an inch a year in diameter. If the soft wood isn’t much good for anything beyond pallets, paper pulp or biomass, it’s perfect for competition: because all the trees are clones, there is little variation between them. Even the knots appear in the same places on different trunks, providing a level playing field for chopping. It may seem a huge waste of wood, but the remnants are processed as chipboard or biomass. The industrial timber still goes to industry it just stops here along the way to get punished.As the sun sinks towards the water, the competition on the harbourside heats up. Hart makes short work of local boy Puybaret in the quarter-finals, calmly checking his axe blade while the other man is still chopping. At this stage, advancement takes its toll: finalists will have to repeat the relay a minimum of four times on the night. Only Hart, looking calm and far fitter than anyone else, seems untroubled. The men with the leaf blowers come out. Sawdust catches in the back of my throat.Cogar and New Zealander Jason Wynyard, the two oldest men in the competition, are destined to face each other in the quarter-finals. Cogar wears a stars-and-stripes beanie for the occasion. He finished well in the time trials, which means he’s had one fewer round to endure, but both men look exhausted.“Let’s go, Dad! You got this!” one of Cogar’s daughters shouts from the stands as he warms up his saw.“Stand to your timber!” the announcer shouts.I laugh, even after all this time.The two men are neck-and-neck until the underhand chop, when Cogar gets his axe stuck in the block and loses vital time getting it out. He almost regains it on the single buck, by all accounts Wynyard’s specialty. But his strength is fading by the time he reaches the standing chop, and he swears as he sees Wynyard finish ahead of him. Wynyard will go on to lose to Hart in the final. When Hart hoists the champion’s trophy over his head, the other contenders hose him down with jeroboams of champagne.Immediately after his defeat Cogar is interviewed by one of the French presenters. She asks where it all went wrong.“Je ne suis pas jeune,” he says. “Et je suis gros.”“And you speak French very well!” she says.“No,” he says. “I do not.”This discipline simulates the felling of a tree. Athletes cut a vertical, 30cm-diameter log in half as quickly as possible. The world record is 12.33 seconds, set by Jason Wynyard at the 2007 Inidual World Championships.The preparation Mark the block with chalk to help you aim when swinging the axe.The stance Stand an axe’s length away from the log, side on. Keep your legs hip-width apart for stability, your front foot in line with the centre of the log.The swinging motion As you swing, push off your back leg and rotate your hip, putting all your weight on to the axe, as you would when driving a golf ball.The technique Cut with the heel (bottom) of the axe, making sure you hold it at a 45-degree angle and alternate between two upward cuts and two downward cuts.The changeover Cut approximately halfway through the log, then switch to the other side to cut through the remaining half of wood and complete the full chop.• Commenting on this piece?

It’s fiddly, time-consuming and, if I’m honest, pretty dull to make. So, before I pick what to make, I always ask myself a few questions: in the interests of not spending the entire party in the kitchen, is a dish relatively quick? Can any of it be made ahead of time? Will any leftovers double up as brunch or lunch tomorrow? And will my children eat it? If I can tick at least some of those boxes, I’m good to go.You can play around with the veg in these, swapping carrots, pumpkin or butternut squash for the potatoes, if you like. Whatever you use, though, don’t leave the fritter mix sitting around for too long once it’s made, otherwise it will go soggy. These are best eaten straight after baking, but they are also good warmed up in a low oven a few hours later, or even the next day.30g black quinoa1-2 sweet potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated to get 250g2 small baking potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated to get 250g1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced25g picked coriander leaves, roughly chopped75g plain flour2 tbsp cornflour1 tbsp ground coriander1 tbsp ground cuminSalt and black pepper400ml sunflower oil2 limes, cut into wedges, to serveCook the quinoa in plenty of boiling water for 10 minutes, until it is cooked but still has bite. Leave to drain in a sieve, then pat dry to remove as much liquid as possible.Put both potatoes, the onion, coriander and quinoa in a large bowl and mix well to combine.In a small bowl, whisk together both flours, the spices, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a good grind of pepper. Slowly whisk in 100ml cold water, until you have a smooth batter.Heat the oil in a medium saute pan on a medium-high flame.Tip the batter into the vegetable bowl and mix together well. Using your hands, form the fritter mix into golf ball-sized portions weighing about 50g each, squeezing them very tightly to compact them and extract most of the liquid. Cook the fritters in batches, so as not to overcrowd the pan: carefully drop three or four balls into the hot oil and fry for about four minutes in total, turning them once halfway, until golden-brown and cooked through, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper (if the fritters start browning too quickly, adjust the temperature of the oil as you go). Serve hot with the lime wedges alongside.This is a fun twist on fish and chips. The polenta can be made and set in the fridge up to a day ahead, ready to be cut into chips and baked. 750ml whole milk1 onion, peeled and cut into 8 wedges1 pinch ground nutmeg2 bay leavesSalt and black pepper250g smoked undyed haddock fillets, skinned3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed½ tsp sweet smoked paprika200g quick-cook polenta50g unsalted butter, cut into rough 1cm cubes, at room temperature 75g gruyère, coarsely grated15g tarragon, roughly chopped20g chives, roughly chopped20g dill, roughly chopped3 tbsp olive oil170g soured cream1 tbsp capers1 lemon – zest grated, to get 1 tsp, then juiced, to get 1 tbspLine the base and sides of a 30cm x 20cm rimmed baking tray with clingfilm. Put the first four ingredients and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt in a medium saucepan. Cover with a lid and put on a medium-low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until steaming and just beginning to bubble. Add the haddock, replace the lid and leave to cook for five minutes, then turn off the heat. Gently lift out the haddock with a slotted spoon and put it in a bowl. Using the back of a fork, break up the fish into small pieces and set aside. Strain the milk through a sieve into a medium saucepan, and discard the solids you should be left with about 650ml of liquid.Put the milk pan on a medium-high heat, add the garlic and paprika, and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium, then slowly add the polenta, whisking continuously, until the mixture thickens – about two minutes. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, cheese, tarragon, three-quarters of the chives and dill, the haddock and a good grind of pepper.Spoon the polenta mix into the prepared baking tray, spreading it out to cover the base and come up the sides by about 1.5cm. Smooth out the top with the back of a spoon, then set aside to firm up for an hour (if you’re making the mix ahead of time, cover the tray and refrigerate overnight).Heat the oven to 230C450Fgas 8. Flip the firm polenta out of the tray on to a cutting board, and trim the sides so you have an even rectangle. Cut the block vertically into 1.5cm-thick strips – you should get about 15 strips – then cut again horizontally into thirds, so you end up with 45 or so chips in total the cutting will be easier if you wipe the knife clean as you go. Transfer the chips to a large oven tray lined with baking paper, spacing them slightly apart, and brush with the oil. Bake for 10 minutes, then flip over each chip and bake for five minutes more, until golden. Leave to cool slightly while you make the sauce.Combine the soured cream, capers, remaining dill and chives, the lemon juice and zest, a quarter teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and serve alongside the polenta chips.Wet your hands to shape the cakes, otherwise things will get very sticky. You can shape them ahead of time and fry at the last minute, if you prefer. And simply omit the chilli from the dipping sauce to make this child-friendly. For the dipping sauce2 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp mirin1 spring onion, finely sliced1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped2 tsp groundnut oil½ small garlic clove, peeled and finely choppedPut the rice in a large bowl of cold water and stir with your hands for 10 seconds, to help release the starch. Drain into a large sieve, refresh under cold running water, then return the rice to the bowl. Cover again with cold water and repeat the stirring and draining procedure four or five times, until the water in the bowl is almost clear. Return the drained rice to the bowl, cover with fresh water, leave to soak for 30 minutes, then drain one final time.Put the drained rice in a medium saucepan, pour on 360ml cold water, cover the pan and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, without lifting the lid or stirring. Turn off the heat and leave the rice, still covered, to rest for 10 minutes.Put the vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Heat gently, just until the sugar dissolves, then pour all over the rice.Sprinkle the cornflour over the rice and then, using a spatula, very carefully stir the rice, so it’s all coated. Cover the pan again and leave to sit for 15 minutes more.Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients. When you’re ready to shape the cakes, wet your hands and have ready a damp plate to put the cakes on. Take about 100g of the rice mix and form into a roughly 4cm-wide x 2cm-thick cake. Put on the damp plate and repeat with the remaining rice, wetting your hands again between forming each cake. You should end up with 16 cakes.Put half the groundnut oil and half the sesame oil in a large, nonstick frying pan and turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil is hot, carefully lay in half the rice cakes and fry for two to three minutes, until the base is golden brown – don’t be tempted to turn them over before they reach this stage, or they may fall apart. Carefully turn each cake, fry for two to three minutes more, then transfer to the damp plate with a slotted spoon and keep warm.

Unfortunately they had already exchanged, but had not yet completed and the owners were away, so no one noticed the flooding.The Callahans are furious because they say their conveyancing solicitor did not explicitly tell them that they needed to insure the house in Brighton once they had exchanged contracts. The requirement, they argue, was buried in a 40-page document they were sent by email, and invited to sign.The cover that would have saved them would only have cost about £50, say providers.Since 2012, the standard Law Society conveyancing contract has required the purchaser to insure the building on exchange, but insurers warn that the industry is only now waking up to this requirement. The couple had already sold a flat to fund the house purchase and were staying with relatives until they could move in. All was proceeding well when James received the fateful phone call saying that water was flooding out of the house.“The whole episode has been a nightmare not of our making and I want to publicise this issue to make sure no one else has to go through this experience. Leaving aside the huge sum of money we have lost, dealing with fallout from this has taken over our lives,” says James.He says when it became clear the house was wrecked they faced an impossible choice of whether to pull out – with the loss of their £50,000 deposit – or to carry on.“Our solicitor advised us that if we did pull out, we could also be liable for everyone in the chain to claim any losses and damages. This could have potentially amounted to a huge amount of money so we felt we had no choice but to go ahead,” he says.The house’s vendor offered to pass on the right to make a claim through their buildings insurance, but he says he has since discovered it will likely only pay about half the £50,000 rebuild cost.Most of the plaster had to be taken\u0026nbspoff and the house is being rebuilt internally.“The loss adjuster is playing hardball and I feel I have little leverage as I’m not the policyholder. Nor will the policy pay for us to rent a replacement place for us to live in, or any of our other costs, for the same reason – as we didn’t take out the policy,” says James.He says a meeting with their solicitor, McMillan Williams, at which point he would have hoped that the insurance requirement would have been pointed out, did not happen as the conveyancer did not turn up. Instead they were simply emailed the lengthy pre-exchange documents.McMillan Williams has denied any liability, arguing that the requirement to insure was set out in the paperwork, which they both signed. It has since offered them £250 in full and final settlement, which they have rejected.The firm told  Money it has offered the couple independent adjudication of the matter, and that it could not comment further as their complaint was ongoing.Colin Bickers of specialist insurer Exchange2completion says that the industry is only now waking up to this issue.“In general too few people are aware of the requirement to insure – both among the conveyancers and the insurance industry,” he says.Bickers says it took his company two years to persuade insurers that there was a need to offer this cover. His insurance has only been available to the public since last October, and he is not aware that any claims have been made. He says cover typically costs between £50 and £100 depending on the building and length of cover.Meanwhile, the Callahans now face trying to recover their losses from the solicitor.“Everyone we speak to about this can’t believe it, and most think this could have been them,” says James. “Of the people who have bought recently around half say they were told that they needed cover at exchange, but the others were as in the dark as us. That can’t be right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a05b6b2c09393eeb0ea8eb2e7bb8022273a4791/244_350_2476_1486/master/2476.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2db774d5c0fe025de0771895b99a1f64","title":"travelling is how i choose to invest my money","story":"Account manager Lou Spearman on why she prioritises trips abroad over saving for a homeEver since I was 18 and backpacked round the world for a year, my focus has been on travelling as much as possible. That comes at a financial cost, of course. I’m terrible at saving because I spend most of my earnings on it. I earn £34,000 a year plus £10,000 commission as an account manager – and £10,000 of that will go on holidays. So far, I’ve ticked off 55 countries. This year alone I’ve visited Myanmar, which must have set me back about £3,000, Amsterdam for a few days, Barcelona for a hen do, the Alps for a few days, Isle of Man for a wedding, Preston for a wedding, and Cheddar near Bath for a hen do.Also in the diary is Ibiza at the end of August, and I plan to go to India or Colombia over Christmas. I might also squeeze in South Korea in October. This year’s been a quiet year for me travel-wise. Where did I go last year? Madeira, Slovakia, Israel, Cyprus, Indonesia, Norway and lots of places in the UK.I’ll always go somewhere long haul once a year on my own. During those trips, I’ll stay in a private room in a hostel – that way I’ll meet more people – and it’s cheaper than a hotel. I use a spreadsheet for my travelling. I always try to over-budget how much I will spend a day – then if I do really want to do something when I’m there, it’s OK.I have a lot of friends who have managed to save up and buy places, but also I don’t have many friends who have been to as many countries as I have. I often get called “lucky” and I get that I am – but travelling is my priority, and that’s how I choose to “invest” my money.I’ll also spend a chunk of money – about £400 a month – on experiences. I love trying new and different restaurants and bars that I’ve never been to before, and going to shows, plays, lectures, museums, crazy golf and weekends away. I am far more interested in spending my money on having a good time instead of buying material things. I will never be able to afford a “nice car”, because I will always want the next trip more.I’m really rigid in terms of how much I’m spending on food, socialising and trips every month. I use a spreadsheet to budget. I put £150 on a Sainsbury’s card once a month – then I know I can’t spend more. Other outgoings include about £120 a month on an Oyster card and £60 on gym membership.Luckily, my dad currently owns the flat that I live in. He bought it six years ago as a way to help my brother and I get on the property ladder. He never wanted us to rent off landlords as it is so expensive and it’s wasted money. My brother lived in the flat for four years before buying a place, and I’ve been living there on my own\u0026nbspfor two. I give my dad £250 a month – which covers the mortgage – and I pay all bills, which come to a couple of hundred a month. This leaves me with about £1,400 “spare” money each month, but it never feels like I have that much money – I\u0026nbspam always paying something off, usually flights.I try to store away £300 a month, and so far have about £3,000 saved. I am in a lucky position because my parents have saved towards a deposit for me so I don’t feel a real urgency to save more.I appreciate that I won’t always be able to afford to just “have fun”, so for now I’m embracing my current financial situation with my social freedom – and, of course, planning the next big trip."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39b23b22093103748a855378f52e1c66b70d8e22/0_369_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08bc5e20ddfbf60aa291dccff69fc2c","title":"why spend 1000 on a smartphone when you could get one for less than 150","story":"An iPhone X is £999, a Samsung S9 £739, but you can find good mobiles that cost a lot lessHow do you find the best-value smartphone deal? If you are anything like me, you can be easily overwhelmed by the range of deals on offer – Carphone Warehouse alone lists 77 different pay-monthly plans. But if your old mobile phone has died, or you just dropped it one too many times, don’t be seduced into signing a £30-a-month, two-year contract for a £500-plus smartphone because, as my recent experience shows, there is just no need to do so.All you need to do is spend a little more than £100 on the latest Chinese-made Huawei (recently rebranded Honor) handset, and grab a £7.50-a-month sim-only deal from Tesco Mobile, and all but the most demanding of mobile users will not be able to spot the difference – and save hundreds of pounds.How did we find out? Well, the Brignall household has just done exactly this, and couldn’t be happier.Faced with a domestic mobile phone crisis – my daughter Lottie had dropped and smashed her old phone – I went on the hunt for a value smartphone that would do all the usual teen stuff, such as sending emails, using social media, surfing the web and, crucially for her, taking good photos.Online reviews and the ’s tech guru Samuel Gibbs pointed me to a couple of handsets – one of his favourite budget options, the then £169 Moto G6, was still a bit too pricey for us, but he also suggested HuaweiHonor. And the more I read online about its handsets, the more I was convinced this was probably the way to go.At the time the £99 Huawei Y6 looked to be best sim-free deal – meaning my daughter could move her sim card over from the previous phone, and Carphone Warehouse could deliver the next day.Within hours of its arrival she was declaring it great and, a few months on, it has proved a great choice. Battery life is very good and it does everything a 19-year-old design student has needed.The camera has been excellent. Its only downside has been its lowly 16GB storage, but this was easily resolved with a £15 insertable SD card.When two months later, my wife’s four-year-old Windows phone died, we again scouted the market.On Amazon Prime Day, we bought the Honor 7C for £114, down from £169. Don’t tell my daughter, but this phone is even better, although some may find the 5.99-inch screen a bit too big.So far she is similarly happy, and it has left us wondering why people are prepared to pay £700 to £999 for the latest handsets.The advantage of buying a sim-free phone – over a contract deal – is that you are not locked in to an expensive provider and can put any sim card in it, at any time. Phones get better and cheaper all the time, so we decided that a three-year contract was no good for us.Tesco Mobile’s sim deal is not the absolute cheapest, but it is very competitive, and the company offers the best customer service in the industry (winning accolades from Which? and scoring the best in regulator Ofcom’s complaints league table).For £7.50 a month Tesco will give you 1GB of data and 500 minutes of calls – if you sign up for 12 months. It you want 6GB of data a month Tesco will charge you £12.50 a month. Tesco uses the 02 network. Giffgaff is also worth looking at, but you can’t go into a store and ask for help.Carphone Warehouse’s sim-only deals (called ID Mobile) are also cheap – 1GB of data and 500 minutes of calls – for £5 a month, on a rolling deal, so you are not locked in.The other advantage of sim-free is that if a better deal comes along you can switch without the bother of having to get the handset unlocked. Also, if you go on a trip outside the EU where roaming charges can still hit, you can simply put in a local sim.This week the Techadvisor website, which spends hours comparing handsets, named the £469 OnePlus 6 the best phone you can buy right now, beating the £999 iPhone X and other rivals. “It is fairly priced, has the best specs you could hope for, looks great and has cameras that can compete with its rivals,” it said.But to me, that still looks way too much. The Huawei P8 Lite is currently £129. If you don’t want to go with HuaweiHonor there are other bargains out there – but you won’t get as much for your money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd37f27d9bfb1e672a787d05a49ba4a67d9e38e7/150_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a1751b266d87d864ecb678ce645378","title":"60 unbelievable facts about kate bush","story":"From boo-bams to Big Boi, here are 60 facts about the musician’s life to mark her 60th birthday 1. John Lydon once wrote a song for Bush called Bird in Hand, which concerned the illegal exportation of South American parrots.2. Bush was inspired to write Wuthering Heights without having fully finished reading Emily Brontë’s novel.3. The 1993 song Lily was inspired by Bush’s friend and personal “healer”, the late Lily Cornford, who believed “in the powers of angels and taught me to see them in a different light”.4. Wuthering Heights was the first time a woman had reached No 1 in the UK with a self-written song.5. In 2001, Bush made a rare public appearance to collect a Q Award for Classic Songwriter. She accepted it with the words: “I’ve just come!”6. In 1980, Bush explained her vegetarianism thus: “I don’t think plants mind being eaten, actually. I think they’d be really sad if no one paid that much attention to them.”7. The same year, she appeared on television with Delia Smith, further expounding on her love of vegetables: “You can even cook them in Marmite,” she offered brightly. “I really do think there’s a lot in vegetables.”8. In 1981, Bush submitted to an excruciating interview with Richard Stilgoe for BBC1’s Looking Good, Feeling Fit, on which she discussed her skincare regime while vaguely exuding the air of someone who would happily strangle him with her bare hands. Exotic instrumentation used on Bush’s albums: the lirone, tupan, boobams, kabosy, singing bowls, strumento de porco.11. After David Bowie’s death, Bush recalled that she’d been at his 1973 “farewell” show and had burst into tears when he announced his retirement. She also penned a tribute, writing: “He was intelligent, imaginative, brave, charismatic, cool, sexy and truly inspirational both visually and musically.” 12. She similarly paid tribute to Prince after his death, writing: “He was the most inventive and extraordinary live act I’ve seen.”13. In 1977, pub-goers in the south-east could have enjoyed a series of live performances by the KT Bush Band. Their set included Bush singing Nutbush City Limits.14. The story about an EMI executive visiting Bush’s house during the 12-year gap between The Red Shoes and Ariel, being told she was going to show him what she’d been working on, then presenting him with some recently baked cakes, is false. 15. Most improbable Kate Bush guest appearance: on Spirit of the Forest, a 1989 Live Aid-style flop of a charity single also featuring Iggy Pop, Kim Wilde, Fish from Marillion, the Jungle Brothers and the Ramones.16. Cloudbusting was inspired by Austrian-American psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, who became convinced he had invented a machine that could form clouds and create rain. Bush sought his son’s blessing to release Cloudbusting.17. Bush’s retreat from the spotlight between 1993 and 2005 was the subject of documentary film, Come Back Kate, which follows die-hard fans and a woman who had never heard of Kate Bush becoming a Kate Bush tribute act.18. In 2013, 300 Kate Bush impersonators, both male and female, re-enacted the video to Wuthering Heights in Brighton’s Stanmer Park.19. The news that Bush had become a mother was only made public two years after her son’s birth, by Peter Gabriel, during an interview.Outkast’s Big Boi is Bush’s most famous hip-hop fan: he once spent a month in England “just to find her”. They eventually met during the Before the Dawn shows. “I talked to her and drank some wine and it was just fucking incredible,” he said. Tupac Shakur was also reportedly a fan.21. Kate Bush once duetted with Rowan Atkinson, playing a lounge bar crooner character, on a song called Do Bears … for Comic Relief. “He’s an utter creep and he drives me around the bend,” sang Bush. “To alleviate the boredom I sleep with his friends.”22. Bush described The Line, the Cross \u0026amp the Curve, the 1993 film she directed and starred in, as “a load of bollocks”.23. Bush turned down an offer to support Fleetwood Mac on their huge 1978 US Rumours tour.24. In Bush’s absence, Pat “Love Is a Battlefield” Benatar’s AOR cover of Wuthering Heights became the best-known version of the song in the United States.25. In 1991, it was claimed that Bush reacted to a London paparazzo by kicking him up the arse. “I didn’t think that anyone so small could kick so hard,” he noted.26. Bush did not enjoy school. “It laid some very heavy inhibitions on me,” she complained.27. Bush asked the Queen for her autograph at a 2005 Buckingham Palace reception. “I made a complete arsehole of myself,” she later recalled.28. Kate Bush was regularly sampled by 90s rave producers. Most demented example? The Good, 2 Bad and Hugly’s hardcore version of Wuthering Heights.29. Kate Bush officially opened Rupert Murdoch’s Sky TV channel in 1984, pulling off a ribbon wrapped round a TV in a ceremony in Swindon.Bush advertised Seiko watches in Japan in 1978 and provided some impossibly gorgeous music for nine commercials for soft drink Fruitopia in 1994.31. For an artist famed for her reclusiveness she had a particular penchant for appearing on children’s television in the first part of her career, including performing her paean to a cloistered gay couple Kashka from Baghdad on Ask Aspel in 1978.32. The opening of Hounds of Love – “It’s in the trees! It’s coming!” – is a sample of a line from the 1957 British horror film Night of the Demon.33. Other films that inspired Kate Bush songs: 1961 gothic horror The Innocents (The Infant Kiss), The Shining (Get Out of My House), Truffaut’s The Bride Wore Black (The Wedding List), The Red Shoes (obviously).34. After meeting backstage at Prince’s 1990 Wembley gigs, she sent him the track Why Should I Love You. Rather than add backing vocals, Prince completely dismantled and restructured the song before sending it back for inclusion on The Red Shoes.35. Professional animal impersonator Percy Edwards was among the guests on 1982’s The Dreaming and was required, for the title track, to impersonate sheep, dingoes, Australian magpies and the sound of a kangaroo being run over. According to an interview with Bush, the latter made him “a little upset”.36. Bush was a prodigious writer in her teens: between 1973 and the release of her debut album in 1978, she apparently wrote 120 songs, most never officially released.37. Her mimed performance of Running Up That Hill on Terry Wogan’s chatshow replaced the official video in the US, which MTV thought was too esoteric.38. Her first live performance was at the London School of Furniture in 1976, as part of her brother Paddy’s final-year show. One observer reported that Bush danced to classical music “wearing some woollen-type suit with a big trumpet thing coming out of her head”.39. Bush’s most-covered song is Running Up That Hill: at least 24 versions exist, by everyone from Will Young to Placebo to drag duo Kiki and Herb.Bush got 10 O-levels at school.41. The Sensual World’s title track has Paddy Bush playing two fishing rods. He says, “The swishing sound … should conjure the atmosphere of fly-fishing, tweed hats and long wellingtons.”42. A self-penned 1980 magazine profile revealed Bush enjoyed books about “religious things or theories of the universe”, the Beano and smoked 20 a day.43. In 2004, writer John Mendelssohn published a novel, Waiting for Kate Bush, about Kate Bush fans awaiting a follow-up to The Red Shoes. A  review described it as “bizarre”.44. It’s possibly not as bizarre as Fred Vermorel’s 1983 book The Secret History of Kate Bush, during which the author “adopted the persona of a mad professor so obsessed that he traces Kate Bush’s genealogy back to the Vikings”.45. According to musicians who worked on her 2011 album of reworkings Director’s Cut, they were not only sworn to secrecy about the project, but encouraged not to listen to the original versions of the songs on it.46. Bush has recorded five cover versions in total, not counting her takes on traditional folk songs: Elton John’s Rocket Man and Candle in the Wind, Marvin Gaye’s Sexual Healing, Roy Harper’s Another Day, Gershwin’s The Man I Love. She also performed a version of the Beatles’ Let It Be live.47. Bush was a regular contributor to her fan club magazine. She is said to have once interviewed herself in the guise of an American journalist called Zwort Finkle.48. In the wake of Before the Dawn, Bush became the first female artist to have eight albums simultaneously in the UK charts.49. Elton John claimed Bush’s duet with Peter Gabriel, Don’t Give Up, had saved his life in the depths of his cocaine addiction. Rufus Wainwright once suggested that Bush’s large gay following was because “she is so removed from the real world. She is one of the only artists who makes it appear better to be on the outside than on the inside.”51. Most improbable place a Kate Bush song has appeared: the soundtrack of reality series Kerry Katona: The Next Chapter.52. Bush once wrote a song for a tribute to Ken Livingstone – the Comic Strip’s 1990 show GLC: The Carnage Continues: “Who is the man that we all need? KEN! Who is the funky sex machine? KEN!”53. The original video for 1978 single Wow was censored by the BBC, allegedly horrified by the sight of Kate Bush patting her bum while singing “he’s too busy hitting the Vaseline”.54. Wuthering Heights is Bush’s most popular song on Spotify with 34m streams, with Running Up That Hill and Babooshka 2nd and 3rd, respectively.55. Director Nicolas Roeg attempted to cast Bush as the female lead in 1986’s Castaway.56 The cover of Aerial features a waveform of blackbird song. Asked by Radio 2 in 1996 who her favourite singer was, Bush said it was the blackbird, and her second favourite was the thrush.57. Last year, an offhand remark by Coachella festival in the New Yorker led to a story that Bush had offered to play the event but been “snubbed”. Both Bush and Coachella denied the claims.58. Asked to name her favourite places in London on the TV show Rough Guide, Bush responded: “I’m not going to tell you because I wanna be there with as few people as possible.”59. Adele cited Bush’s Before the Dawn shows as the reason why she started work on her last album, 25. Kate Bush’s solitary professional activity this year is a piece of writing to be inscribed on a stone near Emily Brontë’s birthplace.All composites by  Design Team"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb537f4ebc67cae7551d6852c0421c259dbd82af/0_0_4872_2923/master/4872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73cc638fcb4501721362838d99b19fcd","title":"bjorn ulvaeus abba was such a european idea","story":"Songwriter, 73, talks Mamma Mia! and AI, but becomes most animated on BrexitMore than four decades after they burst to prominence in the 1974 Eurovision song contest, Abba are once again climbing the charts, while the film Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is riding high having taken more than £9m in its first week at UK box offices.No one is more surprised about the Swedish group’s success – about 400m records have been sold since that Eurovision moment – than Björn Ulvaeus, one of Abba’s two songwriting Bs.“It is quite strange,” he says. “Intellectually, I can understand the huge figures of sold records. But emotionally, it is difficult to grasp that it has meant a lot to a lot of people. You and I are sitting here talking about it this – something I thought would be gone in oblivion two years after we split up. I still don’t know how it happened, but I’m grateful.”After three-and-a-half decades apart, Abba are being reborn later this year, releasing two new songs as “Abbatars” – AI reincarnations of their late-1970s selves, with Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid (Frida) Lyngstad performing the two compositions by Benny Andersson and Ulvaeus. Thesongs are “one pop song like you could have heard in the 70s and one reflective one”, Ulvaeus says.At 73, Ulvaeus is a grandfather, with small spectacles, trim beard and a professorially precise manner. He once said he would never reunite the group, which split after his orce from Fältskog and Lyngstad’s from Andersson, preferring to remember it as “young exuberant and full of life”.The AI idea, he says, helped the group defeat reservations about a comeback: “It’s a challenge and something no one expected. We’re creating heads of ourselves from 1979. The ladies chose that year. I gather they thought we all looked particularly good then.”For a man who charted his own emotional ups and downs in songs, he’s keeping the habit going. “‘I still have faith in you’ is almost existential – and it reflects on our life now,” he says.It took 10 years since the first Mamma Mia! film for Ulvaeus and Andersson to agree a second script, written by Richard Curtis and Oli Parker. “We looked at a lot of scripts. Finally with this one we thought it would be good to see this movie.” Do all four members of Abba have to agree? “This was about music and lyrics, so it’s Benny and me – but when it concerns Abba, we all four talk about it.”In the Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, an expanded cast of actors have another go, with varying proficiency, at Abba songs. Some lyrics may strike a less comfortable note in the era of #MeToo. Would he write Does Your Mother Know? (about a teasing encounter between a young discogoer who is “only a child” and an older man) today? “Maybe I would hesitate today. There was this young girl I must have met in my career, when I was on tour. But I never went across the limit. As you see in the song I told her stay off, take it easy you’re too young… My conscience is clear.”It is Brexit that animates Ulvaeus most. “I’m a European through and through and really, really sad that some Brits don’t want to be with their friends. I just don’t understand it.” Abba was “such a European idea. We took our inspiration from French chansons, German Schlager, Italian ballads and Nordic folk.” Ulvaeus describes his politics as “freethinker and humanist, because if there is some thing up there running there, we don’t know what it is, so we might as well get on with running things as humans, we have to take responsibility”. Now in his eighth decade, he says: “I have more freedom, I am braver, I can make quick decisions and am not as worried as that young man was. I lift my eyes and see the bigger picture more then he did. If I give him advice it would be ‘don’t be so worried. Things will sort themselves out.’”Asked to choose one piece of music to accompany him on a desert island, Ulvaeus hesitates. Abba wouldn’t make his final cut. “I would take a symphony by Beethoven,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd67d160dec6cb615f6004e9ad0861902999547/22_2_516_309/master/516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e237bd1331cfa5585c3b3630533d5dc","title":"stop juul e cigarette from taking off among kids uk told","story":"Ultra-discreet Juul device accused by US campaigners of luring children into addictionAnti-tobacco campaigners are calling for the UK government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette with a super-cool image from taking off among children, as it has done already in America.In the United States, where Juul has been accused of luring children into nicotine addiction, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched an undercover blitz to stop illegal sales of Juul products to children and asked eBay to stop all postings.The ultra-discreet device offers flavours such as mango and glacier mint, and campaigners say the vape pens are hugely attractive to teenagers whether or not they smoke. They warn of addiction to a drug that may be safer than tobacco but could have harmful effects on the growing brain.Juul, which looks like a USB stick, has just launched in the UK. It is the subject of three legal actions in the US, filed in New York and California against the San Francisco-based company, alleging that the device has been deceptively marketed as safe. The New York case is brought by the mother of a 15-year-old boy who, she claims, started using Juul in school because all the other kids did and is now addicted to nicotine. Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the UK government to take action to stop Juul becoming the phenomenon among kids in schools that it is in the US. “It is critical for adults to be aware of this and for adults to educate kids, teachers and others who influence them,” he said. “It is essential for the government to rapidly step in and prevent the sort of social media marketing that turned this into a fad.”Juul took off in the US under the radar, he said, depicted in a launch campaign and then on on social media “being used by young, attractive adults in social, sexual settings that made it look like the coolest new thing”.He added: “It was a phenomenon different from anything I have ever seen. Those of us at the national level became aware of it not through traditional government monitoring, but we began to see stories cropping up from school principals and parents in the media who suddenly discovered their kids were using it. It looks like a flash drive. It isn’t surprising adults missed it, at all.”There were hundreds of media reports recounting schoolkids’ experiences, he said. “The first couple of days it was ‘Juuling because it was fun’. Then it was ‘Juuling because I needed to’. Pretty shocking stuff.”Juul is unobtrusive, high-tech in that it is recharged from plugging into a laptop, and produces little vapour or odour, he said. The nicotine it contains is more palatable, coming from nicotine salts, which are also in dry tobacco leaves, rather than freebase nicotine. In the US, the dose has been high – Myers compares the hit to Marlboro cigarettes. But European regulations will restrict Juul to half the dose in the UK. Dan Thomson, UK managing director of Juul, said it had “a global mission to eliminate cigarette smoking” and hoped to help the 7.5 million people in the UK who still smoke. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer, said the company had seen the stories of use by minors and was talking to the FDA, but said “there is nothing to indicate that the product was designed or marketed to children, because that has never been done”.Studies show vaping among teenagers in the US is not going up, she said. The company was undertaking work itself to establish how many children are using Juul. “It is obvious that some kids are using the product and that is not acceptable to us,” she said, adding that Juul was designed for adult smokers.“What is it that would not be appealing to an adult smoker?” she said. “It’s very easy to use – there are no buttons and no choices.” The launch campaign in 2015 featured models who were over 21 but who looked young, and bright colours were used. “That was a very short-lived campaign,” Gould said. “It did not help us reach our mission. It has not been up for a very long time.” The social media posts were not put up by Juul, she said, and it now has a team employed to find them and get them taken down.Public Health England (PHE) supports the use of e-cigarettes to help smokers quit. “The UK has much stricter regulations than the US,” said Rosanna O’Connor, the body’s director of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and justice.“Juul on sale here has much lower nicotine, print and broadcast ads for e-cigarettes are banned, and selling to or buying for under 18s is against the law. Regular vaping among young people who have never smoked is very rare, while e-cigarettes have become the most popular quitting tool for adult smokers. We will continue to monitor use very carefully but don’t anticipate Juul to change this pattern and hope our experience will be useful to others.”Steve Brine, public health minister said: “The promotion of any tobacco product to children is completely unacceptable. E-cigarettes including Juul cannot be legally sold to young people under 18 and our strict regulations are clear that it is unlawful to promote these products - including on social media platforms. Trading standards have the power to enforce this legislation.”The UK anti-tobacco campaigning group ASH agrees with PHE and welcomes the new arrival. “Juul could be an opportunity for public health,” it said in a statement. “If this product has the same mass appeal for adult smokers in the UK as it has in the US then it may move us closer to a smoke-free future.”But some scientists within the UK dispute the value of e-cigarettes. “The international evidence is now so strong that these products reduce the probability of quitting,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “I find the position of PHE utterly bizarre. Of course they are going to be promoted on social media. If you were to design a product to get children addicted to nicotine, this is exactly what it would look like.”Steve Brine, public health minister said: “The promotion of any tobacco product to children is completely unacceptable. E-cigarettes including Juul cannot be legally sold to young people under 18 and our strict regulations are clear that it is unlawful to promote these products - including on social media platforms. Trading standards have the power to enforce this legislation.”Does that mean they are harmless?No, they are not harm-free, but there is huge debate over how damaging they are or might be in the future. The main concern is addiction to nicotine, so nobody wants non-smokers to start vaping and get hooked – which could also lead them to start smoking cigarettes.There is some evidence of harm from nicotine itself. The World Health Organization said in a report in August 2016 that exposure to nicotine can damage the development of the foetus during pregnancy and “seems to be involved in the biology of malignant diseases”. It possibly has a damaging effect on the foetal and adolescent brain that could be linked to learning and anxiety disorders. E-cigarettes contain many other chemicals as well, including “glycols, aldehydes, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, metals, silicate particles and other elements”. Many of these substances have the potential to cause health harm. However, they are all there in tiny amounts.Is it legal to sell them in the UK?Yes. PHE would like to see companies get a licence for the use of e-cigarettes as medicinal products to help people quit smoking, but that’s expensive and needs a lot of trial data so no company has that sort of licence yet. But they can be sold if they comply with EU regulations, which lay down safety and quality standards and impose advertising restrictions.Can they be marketed to young people?Only to those over the age of 18, but just as kids would smoke behind the bike shed at school, they now try e-cigarettes because they are not supposed to. PHE says there is no evidence they are getting a nicotine habit – but of course there is no long-term data yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d721a181f00a40e8e7fefdf33782d5cadb54e33/0_0_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6735fcde8f7f66b58feb6fd8c610a66b","title":"bitter learned life inside john massey","story":"John Massey, the UK’s longest-serving prisoner, talks about his four escapes and how the prison system has changedJohn Massey sits in a cafe called the Breakout, opposite Pentonville prison in north London. It’s six years since he broke out himself, scaling the nearby prison wall with a makeshift rope and hook. He was 64. Scotland Yard warned the public that the convicted murderer was potentially dangerous and should not be approached. Two days later, he was caught and sent back.But in May this year, Massey was released after nearly 43 years in jail, he was the UK’s longest serving prisoner. Today, over a breakfast of bacon and bubble and squeak, he stares at Pentonville’s walls with a mixture of relief and nostalgia.Massey’s is an astonishing story – one of criminality and violence, regret and loss, humour and chutzpah, love and loyalty. This is a man who escaped prison or breached licence conditions four times, in order to be with relatives who were very ill. He paid for it by serving more than twice his original sentence.One night in 1975, Massey was in the Cricketers pub in Clapton, east London, when a friend (also called John) became involved in a brawl with a bouncer, Charlie Higgins. Massey claims that his friend was stabbed in the eye with a broken bottle. “We were on our way out when all the trouble started. We heard these terrible, piercing screams and I looked round and thought, ‘Where’s John?’ and he was in the middle of it. We had to go in and get him. We took a few whacks with baseball bats and dragged him out. My overwhelming memory of that evening is horror. Seeing my friend’s face with his eye hanging out. People can’t do that to another human being. I was really full of hatred and, before it could fizzle out, I went and done the deadly damage.”First, Massey and another friend took the injured man to hospital. “We had a local place where we had guns stored,” he says. “As soon as we dropped him off, we got tooled up and went back.” Massey comes to a stop. Eventually he speaks: “Obviously I wish we hadn’t, but there we go.” Massey shot Higgins in the chest at point-blank range with a sawn-off shotgun. At the age of 26, he was sentenced to life for murder the judge recommended he serve a minimum of 20 years.Today, Massey is accompanied by his sister, Jane, 10 years younger but a dead ringer for her brother. She listens as he talks about the murder, and how he has changed over the years. “You mellow as you get older, and obviously you have regrets,” Jane says. “He was young and stupid. It was a moment of madness and you can’t turn back the clock, unfortunately.” She often thinks of the life he could have had – as a cabinetmaker or teaching carpentry in college, “because his woodwork is second to none”.Their father was a well-regarded builder, known locally as Jack the Plasterer, who also ended up in jail for stealing lead from a church roof. Massey’s mother struggled to raise their six small children alone, and young John was taken into care. “I remember it clear as day,” he says. “My mum was walking along a country road in Henley-on-Thames. We got to this house and a skinny, tall woman came out with a starched wing collar. They had a little discussion and took me into the garden, and there was this brand new shiny red tricycle with a little boot on the back. So I’m riding merrily around the garden and next time I turn around, my mum’s gone. I screamed blue murder.”From a childhood in care, Massey moved to an approved school (because he was badly behaved), then to a borstal, because he’d started stealing, and finally prison. Despite his skill as a carpenter, he was more committed to crime and became an armed bank robber.When he was sent to prison, Massey’s two oldest sisters, Jackie and Sue, who had no criminal record, were sentenced to three years for harbouring him in their homes. Jackie’s young son was severely disabled, while Sue had three children, and Massey felt he owed them. Then, a few months into his sentence, his younger brother Terry killed himself. “It battered our family,” Massey says. “I could have saved him if I’d been there. You can’t say goodbye, and it hurts for the rest of your life.” He promised himself that, if his family were in trouble, he would, somehow, be there for them.Having lost one son, Massey’s parents were terrified John would kill himself in jail. Instead, he says, he felt emboldened. “I thought, ‘I’m not going to kill myself, but it would be legitimate for me to die in combat, as it were.’ So I fought back, which was kind of stupid, but it got me peace in the end.”The violence dished out to prisoners in the 1970s and 80s was extraordinary, Massey says. “In 1975, the whole British penal system was based on brutality and ignorance. They only employed ex-squaddies as screws: hobnailed boots, bulging muscles with tattoos. Everything was force.” Football violence was then at its peak and Massey says the guards reminded him of hooligans. “When people get a kicking at football, it’s hysteria – you can’t stop it. It was like that. All you can do is curl up in a ball and try to weather the storm.”Shortly before Massey’s 20 years were up, in 1994, he was told he would not be released. He had hardly been a model prisoner, but he felt he had done his time, acknowledging the murder and the huge suffering he had caused Higgins’ family. He decided to take matters into his own hands. When he was granted a home visit to see his father, who was recuperating from a stroke, he slipped away from the two officers sent to guard him the four of them were in the pub – his father in his wheelchair, the prison staff playing pool – when Massey escaped through a toilet window. He headed to Spain via a car boot, a contact’s private plane and a night at the George V hotel in Paris. (After his first restaurant meal out of captivity, Massey called over the maitre d’ to tell him the food was fine but required a little more cinnamon.)In Spain, Massey lived as a free man for nearly two years. “All the family came over regularly. One Christmas we had nephews, nieces, grandnephews, grandnieces – it was wonderful.” His girlfriend gave birth to a son, whom they lost to cot death at four months. They began drinking heavily. “I went a little bit crazy. We both did.”One day, they were in a bar in Fuengirola and his girlfriend was crying. “It was deserted except for three guys at the corner table. She went to the ladies to clean herself up. She had to pass these three English guys, who were making comments, pissed. They said, ‘Who’s upset you, darling, that cunt over there?’” Massey says one of them hit him on the head with a bar stool and that he fought back. He was convicted of grievous bodily harm. It didn’t take the Spanish authorities long to discover he was on the run. The British wanted him back, but the Spanish refused to deport him back to a life sentence (there is no equivalent in Spain). After a year of legal wrangling, he was returned to the UK.Massey has nothing but praise for the Spanish justice system. “They’ve got a completely different attitude. Once a year, they choose a few prisoners out of the whole population and pardon them as a gesture of goodwill. You’d never get that in a million years over here. And you’ve got conjugal visits, so you can increase your family while you’re doing time. If your wife’s been nicked with you, you can even stay in the same cell. Anything they can do to keep the family together. Over here, it’s the opposite. If you were born in London, they’ll put you up in Durham.”Massey claims the Spanish agreed to deport him only on the proviso that he could not be returned to a life sentence. “I had to go to the biggest court in the land, in front of three judges. They decided they could circumnavigate their constitution by putting a provision in the extradition warrant.” He has no copy of this warrant, and is desperate to get hold of one if Massey breaches his current licence conditions – if he is late for an appointment, or argues with his probation officer – he could still be recalled to prison on a life sentence. “And I cannot get within 100 miles of getting a copy. They block me at every twist and turn, because if I got it ratified, everybody would get what I got.”Massey was finally released from Sudbury prison in Derbyshire to a probation hostel in 2007. A few months later, he was told his father was dying in hospital. When he asked for an extension of his curfew to stay with him, it was refused. He stayed at the hospital anyway, until his father passed away four days later. Massey gave himself up and was sent back to prison.It was another two and a half years before he was granted open conditions again, at Ford prison in Sussex. Then, in May 2010, he discovered his sister, Carol, was terminally ill. Refused permission to visit her in hospital, he walked out of the gates and stayed with her until she died two weeks later. This time, he did not give himself up but went to live at his mother’s house in Camden, north London, waiting for “the knock on the door”. It eventually came 10 months later, and he was returned to jail – this time, the closed, category B Pentonville.Is Massey as anti-authoritarian as the prison authorities say? “I’m not anti-authority. I’m not an anarchist. I believe in the rule of law, otherwise there would be complete chaos. I’m anti-hypocrisy.” What does he mean? “Well, I said to one prison governor, ‘What if a member of your family had just been in a road accident and was in intensive care, and your boss says, “Hold on, I can’t spare you”?’ And he said, ‘I’d say, bollocks, I’m leaving.’ I said, ‘Exactly! So what d’you have me down for?’”In June 2012, Massey was told his mother had an aggressive brain tumour and was near death. If he were to reach her in time, this escape had to be more audacious than the previous three. And it was: at 64, he went over the wall.We pay the bill and leave the Breakout. Massey looks healthier than when we first met him a few years ago. My colleague Eric and I were helping Pentonville prisoners produce a newspaper, Voice Of The Ville, and Massey turned up to a class, pale and gaunt.Today, he takes us round the back of the prison to show us how he escaped. A row of terrace houses – staff accommodation – lines one side of the wall. Massey was working in the gym and escaped using netting from a five-a-side goal to make thin but strong rope. He says he was hurt by reports that he had worked in the gym only as part of an escape plan. “They’ve always tried to say that, that I’m manipulative and scheming. But I was building a new woodwork shop where you could teach people the basics in carpentry, plumbing and electricity, and it was actually the gym that headhunted me. I renovated all the machines, otherwise it would have cost them seven grand. I never even thought about escaping, at first.”That changed when he heard his mother was ill. He knew from a stint in Pentonville in the 70s that there was a padlocked hatch in one of the toilets that led to the roof. He undid the padlock and hid in the gym. At 6pm, he opened the hatch, climbed on to the roof and went over the wall.Massey is staring at that very wall as we talk. “I released the rope too soon. It got twisted around my wrist and as I tried to loosen it, it just slipped all the way down. I fell 20ft.” He looks up at the barbed wire at the top. “It looks high now. I’m terrified of heights. But when you’ve got a job to do, it’s do or die.” He broke his foot as he hit the ground. “I almost landed at a screw’s feet. He was walking home. His eyes were like saucers. ‘John, what the fuck are you doing?’ ‘Sorry, mate,’ I said, ‘I ain’t got time to rabbit’ and I flew for the next wall and straight over. Just froze, he did.”Massey spent a couple of days with his mother, then moved to Kent, where he was caught. “I was in a house where the people had just gone on holiday, thinking I was safe. I was watching Wimbledon on the telly when the doors burst open. So I must have been grassed.”As he talks, a woman emerges from a house behind the prison’s wicket gate. “What are you doing?” she asks Massey.“I escaped from here in 2012 – oldest prisoner ever to climb that wall.”She looks closely at him. “‘Oh my goodness,” she says.“I know your face,” Massey says. “You were on A wing?”“Yes, I’m a psychologist. Hello, John, you all right?”“I’m not on the run. I was released a few weeks ago.”“That’s good to hear,” she says.He shows her his copy of the local paper, which has a story about his release. “Nice to see you out,” she says.‘Nice to see you.”Has she got time for a group photo? “No, I’d better not,” she says. “Take care of yourself, John.”She leaves. For a moment, it looked to me as if Massey might get arrested for trying to break into Pentonville prison.When Massey was recaptured, the prison authorities were furious. He was sent to the high-security Belmarsh jail, where he says he was given a tough time. “One governor said, ‘You have upset a lot of people, Massey.’ I said, ‘It’s nothing personal. I just wanted to see my mum.’ The governor said, ‘You ruined a lot of lives.’ Some people got the sack because my escape was made during a security audit.”One morning, Massey claims, he was in the exercise yard when two men in paramilitary uniform approached him. “They’re the dedicated search team, the elite squad. They called me in for a cell search. When I got back, there were eight of them standing outside my cell. As soon as they got me in, they steamed in, hit me from behind first, then got me on the floor and carried on. They must have been beating me for five minutes. If it wasn’t for my experience and my fitness, at my age, I don’t think I would have survived.”When asked to comment, a Prison Service spokesperson said: “A complaint by Mr Massey was investigated by HMP Belmarsh, the police and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, and no further action was taken.”Still, Massey says prison is not as violent as when he was first locked up. He was regularly beaten then, and chemically coshed. “Once, a doctor broke a needle in me when I was struggling – like a horse needle. It doesn’t knock you out, it just immobilises you. I remember lying on the floor of this padded cell, staring up at the ceiling. I couldn’t drag my eyes off it.” What was the justification? “Unmanageable. They wanted me in body belts, and if you were struggling, everything had to be done by force.”These days, he says, the brutality tends to be more psychological. Mental health problems, self-harm and drug addiction have all increased. Ironically, Massey believes this is due to the introduction of a zero tolerance policy on drugs. He talks about a particular category A prison in the 70s: “The governor was an Old Etonian sergeant major type. He’d walk around the prison. That was when people were having a bit of puff. So he’d open the cell door and there’d be six or eight people sitting in a cell laughing, the music’s on, having a good time, nobody wanted to fight. He’d open the door and go, ‘Mmmm, smells interesting! Have a good evening, chaps.’ As long as you weren’t smashing the gaff up or hurting people, he didn’t give a rat’s arse. He ran a smooth prison.”That all changed when mandatory drug tests (MDTs) were introduced in 1994, Massey says. “That’s when heroin started creeping in, because cannabis stays in the system for 28 days and heroin only three. They started going for heroin at weekends, when there are no drug tests. So there aren’t enough smackheads outside, and you want to start creating them inside? Now they want to stamp on the heroin, so inmates are on synthetic psychedelic drugs like spice that don’t show up on MDTs. They lost the war on drugs when they started it.” If government ministers really want to know how to run a safe prison, he says, they should ask people like him. “Who’s the expert: the man who’s done 43 years, or the man who’s done the fast-track and read the textbook?”Now that he’s been released, Massey has no intention of being recalled. He thinks he would have struggled to adapt to the outside world without the occasional taste of life on the outside: “Having the odd break kept me sane.” When he is allowed to leave his hostel, will he move in with his sister? God, no, Jane says. “It’s brilliant having him out, but that wouldn’t be good for either of us. It’s important he has his own little flat, because I don’t want to get on his nerves and he doesn’t want to get on mine. He’s a messy bastard and I’m tidy.”As for Massey, of course he has regrets, and none bigger than the night he took the life of Charlie Higgins. “When you can see the immensity of what you’ve done, the hugeness of what you’ve lost and destroyed, it smashes you to bits.” He also has regrets about the way he behaved in jail. “There comes a time when you start getting bitter and resentful, and you’re making them right about the need to lock you up.”The one thing he has no regrets about is escaping to see his family when they needed him – even if the consequence was an extra 23 years. “Soon after I saw Mum, she started losing her memory, so I got in at the right time. I had a few precious moments with her, and they can never steal those off me.” He is loving life on the outside. He is down at his local gym every morning, where by chance he works out alongside former head of the Crown Prosecution Service and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer. He recently spent an hour with Starmer, telling him his story – and why he’s desperate to remain a free man. “I’m as determined to stay out of jail as any man could be. I’m not going to live as long as I served, and I’ve got a lot to repay people.”• If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd19e127466aa6b235286a59556d8b3f5606f60/0_156_4039_2424/master/4039.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ca403284886732c393010ade36fcc9e","title":"eleven sports new player sport broadcast rights","story":"When the new season arrives there will be some changes to get your head around. New players, new managers, new shirts, new tactics and new haircuts. This year, there will also be a new broadcaster.On Monday, Eleven Sports announced it will be launching in the UK on 9 August. Its opening event will be exclusive coverage of the US PGA Championship. That will be followed by both La Liga and Serie A football, pinched from under the noses of Sky Sports and BT Sports respectively. For some fans, who already pay for one or both of those services, this development will be like taking a rabbit punch to the wallet.Eleven Sports does not see it quite like that, of course. A British company already active in seven countries, it casts itself as a nimble outsider taking on established broadcasting giants. Founded by Andrea Radrizzani, the owner of Leeds United, and run by Marc Watson, the man who won the Champions League for BT, Eleven sees its future success as being determined by an ability to shake things up.“We’ve seen in our global markets that if there isn’t live competition there tends to be a lack of innovation,” Watson says. “New players bring new ideas and fresh thinking. They invest in new areas and look at different ways in which premium sports is produced, packaged and distributed. We can see a model for a challenger brand, which is what we come in as. But in those first 18 months you have to work really hard to find your position … to demonstrate you’re here to stay.”In building its business across the world – in countries as disparate and different as Belgium, the United States and Singapore – Eleven has tried different tactics to engage new audiences. In Taiwan its anchors are not grizzled ex-pros but wise-cracking entertainers. In Italy it bought the rights to Serie C, serving every match live to a small but dedicated audience, and filming the matches on just two cameras (rather than the 33 mandated by the Premier League).One constant has been to staff each business locally rather than fly them in from the UK. Another has been that the package on offer to customers pairs second- or even third-tier domestic sports, speedway in Poland or Ultimate Frisbee in the US, with top foreign football. It is a strategy it is following again in the UK.“La Liga and Serie A are very good places to start”, says Watson. “They’re brilliant products, the viewing figures are very good. Sky have had La Liga for 20 years and there’s a reason for that, it works for them. It’s a good product with big teams and world-class players. They fought really hard to keep it away from BT three years ago, though the market has changed since then.”That might be something of an understatement. Sky, the dominant force in sports broadcasting for two decades and still rights holder to the vast majority of Premier League matches, is currently the subject of two takeover bids, by Comcast and 21st Century Fox. BT, which entered the sports market in 2012, has scaled back its spending, perhaps reaching the limits of its strategy to lure customers to broadband through football. Amazon, meanwhile, has joined the party by acquiring the rights to two full Premier League matchdays per season (for an undisclosed fee).Eleven does not rule out looking at the Premier League when the rights come up for sale once again in three years. It seems likely the landscape will be different then.The company promises a new approach to covering La Liga and Serie A, one designed to appeal to a younger audience (at the same time it hopes to hold on to the same viewers who have watched Spanish football on Sky for 20 years). There will be space on its channel for Instagram sensations the F2 Freestylers and a less buttoned-up approach to matches.More significantly, perhaps, Eleven looks set to change the way people pay to watch sport. The company says it is open to agreeing deals with BT, Sky or Virgin to carry their channel, but the primary way of accessing its content will be through its website or app. While the cost of watching Lionel Messi perform for Barcelona has yet to be announced, the marketing promises “affordable pricing” and no “bundled packages or contracts”. As an example of how it has done previously, Eleven’s Serie C coverage was available in season or month-long passes, or you could simply pay per match.Being a global sports TV company without any broadband to flog or platforms to maintain opens up opportunities. Eleven has also taken risks – one of the countries it plans to expand into soon is Myanmar, a country suspected by the UN of having committed acts of genocide against its Rohingya people, where it has acquired the rights to broadcast the local football league. The company is “sensitive to the issues and made a considered decision to do business in Myanmar”, according to Watson. “We believe in the power of sport to bring people together.”A new entrant in the competitive world of TV sports, with an ambition to do things differently, a lot of people will be watching Eleven Sports keenly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d41008a727ad4d4c08e296a7b72b63ba4bccf3df/0_81_4525_2715/master/4525.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbf9a51dd3fbbbbb6582a1ef947d8541","title":"lando norris lewis hamilton mclaren test driver","story":"The 18-year-old British test and reserve driver is in a fierce battle in F2 and well on track for the step up to Formula OneFor a driver tipped to be a star of the future in Formula One and indeed, one so young, Lando Norris seems impressively free from unnecessary ego – doubly so given the British driver is on what appears to be a fast track into F1. He is McLaren’s test and reserve driver and after last Sunday’s German Grand Prix he was set to climb behind the wheel of their car for the test at the Hungaroring on Tuesday. He is also in a fierce battle in F2, a competition fast honing his skills for the expected step up to the top series.Still only 18, Norris is part of the McLaren young driver programme and is in demand. McLaren’s CEO, Zak Brown, revealed that three F1 teams had approached about him, including Toro Rosso as a potential replacement for Brendon Hartley. Brown rejected them because they wanted him freed from his contract with McLaren. The CEO, who is waiting to see which way Fernando Alonso jumps next season, is fully aware of the value of having such a talent on board.All that might turn a young man’s head. But Norris remains refreshingly normal, with the same self-doubt familiar to teenagers. “I am up and down,” he says. “Sometimes it can go wrong and I come away happy and positive and know I can improve, and sometimes I think everything is terrible and that I am not very good. And that makes me annoyed with myself.”There have, however, been many up moments. He was the youngest winner of the world karting championship in 2014, aged 14. He won the inaugural MSA formula championship the next season. In 2016 he took the Formula Renault 2.0 European Cup and the Eurocup Formula 2.0 title. Last year he was champion at the first attempt in European Formula 3, the youngest driver to achieve that.This season’s F2, driving for Carlin, is proving a real challenge. He opened superbly with a win at Bahrain and held the lead until the sixth round in Austria. There he was overtaken by the British Mercedes reserve driver, George Russell, who went better still in the next round at Silverstone and now has a 37-point advantage.Norris says that was an instructive experience. “I’ve learned to try and not be down as much when it goes wrong,” he says. “Sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. In the past I would have been the opposite, I would have been annoyed. I am still a bit up and down but have learned you don’t need to be down so much.” This is a young man learning to deal with the brickbats a career in racing is going to throw at him and he is doing so well.Norris was initially interested in bikes, with Valentino Rossi catching his eye and the Italian remains his hero. He grew up near Yeovil and a visit to the British kart championship at Clay Pigeon Raceway after school one day ignited something. His father was dispatched to buy a race suit so he could try it. “A guy had one to sell, it was massive with boots that were way too big and Dad bought it,” he recalls. “Not long after I got a kart and we had a bit of tarmac at home and I drove round that.”He was seven at the time and a decade later was on McLaren’s books. Last season he drove at the test in Hungary and impressed, second only to Sebastian Vettel. McLaren were important to him as the team he had followed as a boy. “Growing up watching Lewis and Fernando, my favourite car was the McLaren in that chrome and fluorescent orange,” he says. “McLaren were one of the first teams I liked and supported.”Brown has such confidence in him he put him in his United Autosports car for the Daytona 24 this year. Their ride was off the pace but Norris made his mark in a stint in the wet, during the night, outpacing the rest of the field. He has proved he has the chops repeatedly – from his titanic battle with Max Defourny in Formula Renault in Austria, where he put two wheels on the grass to make the decisive pass for the win, to the F2 at Silverstone, where he made a bravura move to pass Artem Markelov and Nyck de Vries round the outside of Vale for third with a damaged car.F1 is the target and, while he admits making it would be a big step, what he really wants are wins and the championship. If he finds himself in a seat at McLaren next season – and it is entirely possible he will – the task will be hard. Typically he is thinking about it in terms of the team, rather than himself.“It is challenging knowing that, if you do join, a lot of work is needed to help the team develop the car,” he says. “If you do eventually get there, it makes a win sweeter. If you were there for two years and ended up wining a championship in year three or year four, that would make it a better win for the team and for yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5512582b85df7d1b6f0406f230b0fb41370662a/70_161_2754_1653/master/2754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9247b449808749894ecd1e05925a216","title":"adil rashid yorkshire england red ball cricket","story":"Adil Rashid’s selection by England for the first Test with India has caused one hell of a stink. But until he and Yorkshire go public on the true reasons why he currently does not want to play four-day cricket for the club, so much of the criticism flying around will be ill-informed.Because let’s be honest, it’s pretty clear that this is not a case of Rashid simply not wanting to play red-ball cricket, given he’s accepted the call-up. It seems from the outside that he doesn’t want to play red-ball cricket for Yorkshire. There is a big difference here. Ed Smith, the national selector, is probably privy to the reasons why but perhaps the supporters and the pundits need to hear them too.Because right now there is mainly just speculation and in some quarters he is being painted as a guy who has betrayed the county he has been a part of since he was 10 years old.Knowing Rashid as I do – we were teammates for his first-team debut in 2006, before I went on later to become head coach – this will have hurt him a lot, hence he has since bitten back at some of it.When Rashid took the decision to specialise in white-ball cricket at the start of the year, he said it was down to losing some motivation as regards the longer stuff. This is not uncommon when players drop out of an international team and think there is no way back, as was\u0026nbspprobably the case when he returned from a reasonable winter tour to then be overlooked for first Liam Dawson and then, come a marquee Ashes tour, the inexperienced Mason Crane.But when a guy gets a sniff of a Test call-up and yet still declines a County Championship match – as Rashid did for the recent Roses fixture – it points to something a bit deeper and fundamental. Should he have played? Yes, skills-wise it would have been sensible. But for one reason or another, it appears he doesn’t want to be in that environment for extended spells, as opposed to dipping in and out for one-day matches.How this gets resolved is anyone’s guess and it is hard to envisage a way forward together, not least since the England and Wales Cricket Board has made it mandatory for international players to play the relevant format for their counties from next season. I genuinely hope the two parties can make peace however.In all likelihood the issues stem back to Rashid declining to play in the County Championship decider at\u0026nbspLord’s in 2016 in what was my final match as head coach. Now this was a huge occasion. Middlesex and Somerset had been battling it out all season at the top but a win for Yorkshire and we would have made it three titles in a row, despite having dipped a fraction from the previous two years.Was I happy at the time? Of course not. He’s a professional cricketer and to miss a game of that magnitude was hugely disappointing. But I will always defend him for the fact that he had flagged up a desire to rest and spend time with his family at the end of the season two months earlier, knowing he was likely heading on tour with England to Bangladesh and India soon after, and so stuck to his guns. We knew this was the situation for a good while, we just couldn’t change his mind.That match at Lord’s wasn’t to be for Yorkshire. But it was clear from that moment his relationship with the club changed. And it is a huge shame because personally I have always found Rashid good to work with and he is clearly a fine cricketer, hence I even took him with me to Adelaide Strikers for one season.He is his own man and I do think that becoming a family man, and his growing Muslim faith, have seen cricket change from being an all-encompassing passion to a career that puts food on the table. But that’s not a bad thing. As he has matured and gained this wider perspective, it has helped him to develop as a cricketer and person.If I am sympathetic to the player then this also extends to my old club and colleagues at Headingley, who keep seeing their plans ripped up by external events. Rashid could have timed his white-ball specialism better than late into pre-season, the impact of which was heightened when Liam Plunkett and David Willey left for the Indian Premier League at the 11th hour.Yorkshire have also seen Kane Williamson’s spell shortened by New Zealand, Billy Stanlake’s overseas spell for Twenty20 cancelled completely by Cricket Australia at the last minute and now it would appear that Rashid will likely miss a huge chunk of the campaign they thought they actually had him for.How Rashid goes against India will be fascinating to watch because taking 20 wickets is going to be the big challenge for England in what should be a ripping series. Virat Kohli’s record in this country may be pretty average but he is a serious player and should have a huge impact over the course of five Tests.The tourists may have lost Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar for the first part but we had Ishant Sharma for two months at Sussex and he learned a lot about the Dukes ball and the lengths required. So look out for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cce2a93f39c465563b519709fab70224de5a0bc/30_82_5068_3040/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc8e92979cabc97c694281869bd5d33","title":"elon musk tesla investors model 3","story":"Electric car firm has hit trouble, and Musk – who has a knack of making enemies – must explain to investors what is going on The last time Elon Musk addressed the analysts who follow Tesla, his electric car company, he was – to say the least – rude. “Boring, boneheaded questions are not cool,” he told the analysts. “These questions are so dry. They’re killing me,” Musk complained.Predictably, the outburst led to a selloff for Tesla’s shares – one the company can ill afford. On Wednesday he gets another chance, when Musk must once more explain to investors what is going on at Tesla.Gene Munster, managing partner of venture capital firm Loup Ventures, has been a long-time fan of Tesla and Musk, and even he concedes another angry performance from Musk would be “a disaster”.And in the time since they last talked, Musk has shown plenty of evidence that he has, steering the company and his reputation into a multi-car pile-up of scandals that has left some wondering whether he can can walk away.Musk has also used Twitter, where he has 22 million followers, to go after journalists. He has also attacked short sellers – investors betting on a collapse in Tesla’s share price – for what he sees as a concerted attempt to undermine the company.Tesla has faced a series of investigations into crashes – some fatal. Musk has been in a public spat with a former employee who says he blew the whistle on dangerous work conditions. Musk calls him a “saboteur”.The company, and Musk, have also had to come out to defend a decision to ask for rebates for funds given to US suppliers, a move critics charged shows how badly Tesla is in need of cash. None of this news has won him new friends.“Elon Musk is a total fraud,” and Tesla is a company “best known for blowing deadlines and consistently falling short on production,” wrote the New York Post.“Is Elon Musk too volatile to run Tesla and SpaceX?” Fortune asked this week.Tesla’s “rockstar CEO” is “starting to lose his groupies,” according to the Street he’s “a terrible manager,” according to Inc.Jim Chanos, an investor who has made a fortune betting on company collapses, believes Tesla is “heading for a brick wall”.It really shouldn’t be this way. Here’s a self-made billionaire who wants to make the world drive electric cars, fund the next space race and colonize Mars. Robert Downey Jr used him as the model for Tony Stark, Iron Man’s alter ego. He’s dating Grimes and named one of his companies Boring. There’s so much to like. So why is Musk such an asshole?The answer may well be stress. Since Tesla’s initial public offering eight years ago, it has only had two profitable quarters. And Tesla is burning through cash like a lottery winner in Las Vegas. The company lost about $2bn last year and at the end of March, Tesla had about $2.7bn in cash. Last year Bloomberg reported that the company was burning through $500,000 per hour.While he says the company is in trouble, Munster remains bullish on Tesla and thinks there is a “low probability” of a combative performance from Musk this week.“Musk is the most colourful, controversial CEO out there,” he said. “This is what great companies go through.”Munster sees Musk as a CEO in the mold of Apple’s Steve Jobs – someone who is capable of transforming an industry, and with such transformational leaders “it’s normal to have these pendulum swings. But obviously he’s exaggerated his.”Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, says that Tesla is staring at the end of the runway and needs to start making a profit. But, he points out, those concerns should be set aside the scale of what Tesla is trying to do – and what it has accomplished.“Tesla is struggling to transition from a custom, one-off car manufacturer to a mass producer,” he says. “But it has accomplished a lot.”The success of the Model 3 is vital to Tesla. The vehicle costs about $35,000, close to the price of GM’s Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle and less than half the price of Tesla Model X.In May 2016, Musk estimated that the company would make 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s during the second half of 2017. Tesla made just 1,810 Model 3s in the last six months of 2017.Production is ramping up. In July the company announced it had finally hit its numbers, making 5,031 Model 3s during the final week of June and 28,578 during the second quarter, more than it had made in the prior three quarters combined.But how much it cost Tesla to get there – and whether that pace is – will be a key questions on Wednesday.“I think perception will change. Two years from now I think people will see that Elon Musk has changed the way people move around,” said Munster. As long as Musk doesn’t crash it into a wall first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cdadd5ed0709fec3f2d9246c659948192f5b146/0_0_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=117760bcd946f5e6a3162f44efb1495b","title":"10 best uk small islands beaches summer holidays novelists nature writers","story":"With cooling sea breezes and quiet beaches, our small islands are perfect places to enjoy a hot summer. Novelists and nature writers reveal their favouritesI have been visiting the Isle of Harris (pictured above) for 20 years and love its dramatic contrasts. The east coast landscape is rock and water, with small hamlets clustered in inlets that look like miniature fjords the west coast is all dramatic sweeps of brilliant white sand and glassy turquoise water.The brilliant green machair teems with wild flowers. Dramatic mountains rear out of the sea to the north, bordering the Isle of Lewis. No two moments are the same.Few places can match the temple of Chaipaval near Northton. Go past the gate (with the quaint small shop and honesty box) and follow the close-cropped path to the crumbling ruins perched on the edge of the sea. High overhead, eagles circle from their hillside nesting spots. Out to sea lies the island of Pabbay in the Sound of Harris, and beyond the horizon lie St Kilda and thousands of miles of Atlantic Ocean stretching to Newfoundland.The inlet at Northton and its meadows of sweet grasses are a haven for birds: terns, plovers, curlews – and the wistful cry of oystercatchers. After hours of walking along beaches or climbing the hills, sit in Temple Café, with its log stove, stone floors and huge windows full of breathtaking views, enjoying coffee and delicious homemade cakes, and watching the birds. Built to celebrate the pioneering ornithologist William MacGillivray, it is now an inspired cafe, with bird books and information on the astonishing MacGillivray (from the age of 15 in the early 19th century, he would regularly walk from his home in Harris to study at Aberdeen University). For luxury, stay at Scarista House (doubles from £225, including breakfast and afternoon tea), while the Am Bothan Bunkhouse in Leverburgh is a convivial budget option (dorm beds £25). Madeleine Bunting is the author of Love of Country, A Hebridean JourneyA charismatic boatman, a stripey lighthouse, sparsely beautiful land and seascapes, singing seals, sunsets – Bardsey (in Welsh, Ynys Enlli, off the tip of north Wales’s Llyn peninsula) has every desirable feature of a small island. But another quality elevates it above other places surrounded by saltwater: it is a deeply spiritual place.Asserted by me, this sounds fairly meaningless. But in 1120, Bishop Urban of Llandaff attracted visitors to Enlli (“isle of the currents”) by hailing it as the resting place of “20,000” saints. In medieval times, many people chose to be buried here, supposedly to obtain an easier passage to the next life.Pilgrims still travel to Enlli, and perhaps their peaceful presence reverberates for more secular visitors. Christine Evans, a Welsh poet who is a summer resident on Enlli, believes its spiritual qualities derive from its geography. Enlli’s back – its modest mountain – is turned on the mainland to the east, so islanders are permanently oriented to the west. Sunsets trace a pathway to a sense of a world beyond.There’s nothing to consume on Enlli beyond what’s in the tearoom and gift shop run by Jo, the island’s farmer, and that’s the point. Visitors live deeply in the moment they climb the mountain (in 15 minutes), encircle the island (in an hour) and make their own entertainment – swim, dream, watch birds, or bees buzzing at the fuchsia, imbibe the deep wonder of the world. Visit on a day trip (£30 adult, bardseyboattrips, very weather-dependent), or stay longer to experience the island’s magic – book self-catering stays via the charitable trust that looks after the island (from £285 a week for two, bardsey.org).Patrick Barkham is a  journalist and author of Islander: A Journey Around Our ArchipelagoMy first encounter with this island off County Antrim was as a participant in a writing festival in 2002, and I go back as often as I can. One of my favourite walks is on its south-western side at Roonivoolin: the road winds past dry stone walls and the lime-white remains of the old kelp house to Craigmacagan Lough, where water lilies float and the sheep obligingly move out of the way of walkers.Further on, the path follows the outline of Ushet Lough, where islanders still race handcrafted model yachts. From the cliff top there are views over purple kelp beds, north to the upper island, south to the bulk of Fair Head on the mainland, and east to the lighthouse at Altacorry, site of Marconi’s early wireless experiments. The fortunate may hear the “crex crex” of the corncrake, recently returned to the island, or catch a glimpse of the island’s rare golden hare.From the harbour, take the Puffin Bus to the RSPB West Light Seabird centre for a tour of the “upside down” lighthouse, watch fulmars and razorbills wheeling around the stacks, and puffins nesting in the cliffs from spring until early August.There’s a range of places to stay, from the National Trust’s recently refurbished Manor House (doubles £110), comfy B\u0026ampBs, well-appointed hostels and brand new glamping pods with stunning views over the Sound. There’s pub grub at McCuaig’s Bar, snacks at the Water Shed Café, full dining at the Manor House (lobster must be ordered early so the fishermen can haul it in from the holding pots in the bay). Ferries run from Ballycastle several times daily and, in the summer, round-Rathlin cruises are available. (The next are on 6 August, 20 August and 8 September)Bernie McGill is the author of The Watch House, set on Rathlin at the time of Marconi’s wireless experiments in 1898Step ashore on the island of Bryher in Scilly – an archipelago of dozens of islands, five of them inhabited, 20 or more miles out into the Atlantic – and you lose your heart, at once.The 2¾-hour sea voyage may churn the stomach, the architecture may be ordinary, the weather untrustworthy, but the island and the people are sheer joy. We have been coming to Bryher for some 40 years, with children and grandchildren. It’s about a mile-and-a-half long and, in places, only a few hundred metres wide. Walk all around the sea shore in two hours. But what a walk! Hell Bay, with its wild winds and rearing cliffs on one side, with nothing for 2,000 miles until the coast of Canada and on the more sheltered side, beaches of glorious sand. Go to Rushy Bay and look out towards uninhabited Samson Island. Swim in clear, cold sea, with a seal or two for company. People are rare. Oystercatchers are not, they pipe at you, letting you know that although they are happy to see you, this is their place.The crab and lobster caught by the Jenkins family are the best I have tasted: try them at Fraggle Rock Bar, where the fish and chips are also to die for. The fudge sold outside Veronica Farm is wickedly wonderful.For a storymaker like me, Bryher is a treasure trove. High on the moors, ancient chieftains lie buried. A sword belonging to one of them was discovered only a few years ago. King Arthur himself is thought to lie in a cave under the Eastern Isles. Many of my books have been inspired by Bryher.I wrote two books inspired by that sword, that place, one called The Sleeping Sword, and another Arthur High King of Britain. I wrote also about a whale being washed up on Bryher at the time of WW1, Why the Whales Came, and another about one of the hundreds of wrecks lying under the sea around Scilly. That one I called The Wreck on the Zanzibar. Then there was Listen to the Moon, set on Bryher, again, and on St Helens one of the uninhabited islands, with an abandoned Pest House. As I said, a treasure trove of stories and myths.We stay near Green Bay in rented cottages, but there’s also the often-windy campsite and the comfortable Hell Bay Hotel (doubles from £95 B\u0026ampB). There’s a great shop and even a tiny museum – in a telephone kiosk.They call Scilly the fortunate isles. They are: none more than Bryher. Go, but tread softly.Michael Morpurgo’s 2014 children’s book, Listen to the Moon, is set on BryherIt was Northey, on the River Blackwater near Maldon, that cemented my love of Britain’s tiny islands and moved me to write a book to celebrate them. The low-lying isle had been made deliciously mysterious by a cloak of mist. I waited impatiently for the tide to fall away from what I could make out of the (probably) Roman-built causeway, before picking my way across. Thick Essex mud shone silver in the retreating water on either side.In 991, it was local Saxon leader Byrhtnoth’s decision to allow a party of Norse invaders across this causeway that led to his death, to the payment of Danegeld to the Viking raiders and, arguably, to Harold’s defeat at Hastings 75 years later.Northey is a plaything of the Blackwater: the National Trust-owned island expands to 300 acres when the river is at its lowest, but shrinks to a mere 80 at spring high tides. The tidal creeks that feed the liminal salt marshes are excellent habitats for overwintering birds: the isle is internationally important for Brent geese, shelduck and widgeon, all of which can all be viewed from Northey’s hide.The picturesque town of Maldon is just over a mile (but seemingly another world) away via a delightful riverside path, and is home to Intimo-Fresco, a family-owned Italian restaurant and a fitting place to conclude a visit after crossing that (probably) Roman causeway.More of an islet than an island, the Calf of Man is a square mile of heather, gorse, cliffs, sea spray and soaring birds in the Irish Sea, a giant’s leap across a fast tidal race from the south-west corner of the Isle of Man. It is possible to stay overnight, but most visitors come for the day – to see the basking sharks and sunbathing seals, and to lock binoculars on the 30-plus bird species that breed here.There are razorbills, kittiwakes, acrobatic choughs and, most notably, manx shearwaters. The breeding colony of these birds was wiped out by rats from a sinking Russian merchant ship in the early 19th century, but has been revived in recent decades. Though the Calf was farmed until the middle of the 20th century, it is now a bird sanctuary, and the only summer inhabitants are the two wardens.Scant buildings include two disused lighthouse towers, built by the famed Robert Stevenson, and a modern, automated lighthouse. Those who wish to experience the ascetic life of a Victorian lighthouse keeper can stay in the stone farmhouse-cum-observatory, where there are eight beds (open mid-April to early September, minimum two nights, £40 for two self-catering, manxnationalheritage.im). Bring a sleeping bag, towels, and food to cook on the wood-burning stove.Boats, run by private operators, make the half-hour crossing all summer, weather permitting, from Port Erin and Port St Mary on the Isle of Man.There is nowhere to buy food or drink on the Calf, so bring supplies. Back on the mainland, eat Manx queenies (queen scallops) at the Fish House in Port St Mary or try the Albert Hotel for an evening pint. Robert Penn is the author of The Man Who Made Things Out of TreesThe Isle of Portland, 4½ miles long and 1¾ miles wide, is a defiant block of the Jurassic Coast, weathered by 100 million years of restless sea, anchored to the Dorset mainland by the thread of Chesil Beach. Its limestone built London – St Paul’s, the Blackwall Tunnel, the Royal Exchange – and the railway line that once carried people and stone can now be walked. Historically, inhabitants thought of themselves as not-quite English: mainlanders weren’t trusted and were called Kimberlins (strangers). Thomas Hardy described Portland as the Isle of Slingers, repeating stories of Portlanders throwing stones to keep Kimberlins away. Nonetheless, over the past decade we have visited every year with our children, to swim off Ferrybridge, kayak on the Fleet and celebrate birthdays at the Crab House (it specialises in seafood and has its own oyster beds). We’ve explored Tout Quarry Sculpture Park and Broadcroft Quarries butterfly reserve. We’ve searched the cliffs for peregrines, visited Portland Bird Observatory, and discovered the Chiswell Earthworks land sculpture, part of Common Ground’s New Milestones project).We’ve stayed in self-catering places such as Stonehall, once a schoolhouse (from £100 a night – but check out the Old Higher Lighthouse and camping at Sea Barn Farm).There is a strange allure to Portland. It’s harsh in places, treeless, a challenge to our dreams of islands and visions of British seaside. Every age has left its mark. The Romans had a name for it: Vincelis. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the Vikings’ first raid on English soil was here, in 789 AD. Inigo Jones specified Portland stone for Henry VIII’s banqueting hall in Whitehall. The rich layers of history, geology and wildlife mingle and, after each visit, my affection for Portland is a little deeper cut and I want to return. • Portland’s b-side arts festival runs from 8-16 SeptemberAdrian Cooper is publisher-editor at Little Toller BooksThe most impressive man I ever met was a man I met on Muck, the smallest of the Small Isles, in the Inner Hebrides south of Skye, one mile by two, low-lying, fertile (cattle, sheep, Highland ponies), population about 40. The man had hands like houses and rarely spoke and, though kind, he didn’t give a flying Lutrogale perspicillata (smooth-coated otter, to lay readers) what anyone thought of him. Everything he did – and he could turn those outsize hands of his to anything – he did well. He was the archetypal Hebridean islander.I’d wanted to visit Muck (and Canna and Eigg and Rum) for years, obsessed as I was with the Highlands and Islands – a romantic ideal I’d built in my head from books. A friend and I had taken kayaks with us on the ferry from Mallaig. We stayed with the impressive man and his family in tiny Port Mòr. They ran a B\u0026ampB back then.By day, eyed by otters, laughing puffins and sleek grey seals, we circumnavigated Muck. We also climbed Beinn Airean for the spin-around view – lumpy Rum, the wedge of Eigg, the Sea of the Hebrides. We tramped to the white-sand beaches of the north, swam, beachcombed, and tramped back for tea and quiche at the craft shop. And in the evenings, after supper, to the peeping of going-to-bed oystercatchers and the shushing of the sea, we lit a driftwood fire, looked up at the stars and were at peace.A Calmac ferry service  to Muck and the Small Isles runs from Mallaig year-round, and MV Sheerwater offers day trips from Arisaig, from April to September. There’s accommodation for all budgets for those who want to linger (see isleofmuck): bunkhouse, B\u0026ampB, self-catering cottages, a yurt, and wild camping (with permission).Dan Boothby is the author of Island of DreamsThe north Norfolk coast has been gentrified, for better and for worse, since I was a boy. But there is one terra incognita in most visitors’ mental maps: Scolt Head.It’s a tidal island, a four-mile-long oblong of tawny sand dunes that from the air resembles an embryo. And Scolt is still growing with the vigour of a child, sand accumulating at its western end, where thousands of chalk-winged terns nest.It is a place of wind, space and peace, dominated by the highest dunes in Norfolk, which deliver glorious views stretching from Lincolnshire in the north down to Sheringham. Its great capillaries of salt marsh turn purple with sea lavender in July.Salt marsh is the last wilderness in southern Britain and few (sensibly) risk walking across them to Scolt Head at low tide, preferring the tide-dependent local boat. The island is an increasingly important sanctuary for shorebirds, so definitely don’t bring a dog and, ideally, visit outside nesting season (April to July).Back on the mainland, there are two seafood shacks in Brancaster Staithe, as well as the excellent White Horse pub.The only obvious human imprint on Scolt is its fairytale wooden hut, built in 1924 for Scolt’s first “watcher”, or warden, Emma Turner.She captured Scolt’s magic – “not an indolent peace, but rather that of rest in motion” as she put it. “That first day of solitude has bitten deep into my memory it filled me with wild joy to think that for months I should possess the island with all its mystery and loveliness.”• Boat tours of Scolt £30 adult (brantacruises) ferry from Burnham Overy Staithe (burnhamoveryboathouse)The seals sing to visitors on Holy Island. Their voices rise and fall across the glassy water of Coves Haven. The lament of mermaids, half sad, half beautiful, spiralling towards me. This morning, I watched hundreds of day trippers cross the causeway to descend on the island, but now they are somewhere else, off visiting the ruins of Lindisfarne Abbey or buying mead, and there is nobody to witness the song except me.I am bowled over with joy at the seals and cartwheel down the white-sand beach, even though, at my age, I should probably give up acrobatics.Holy Island is the place I run to when life gets tough: it’s cut off at high tide when the water covers the causeway. My mobile shows no signal and I couldn’t care less. I can spend hours wandering the five-mile coast, holing up in the dunes with a flask and a book, while the breakers roll in and the oystercatchers make their way towards me. Or I follow one of the Holy Wander leaflets: walking guides with a difference, they are full of contemplative questions to help you think about the bigger things in life.The guides are available from the bookshop of The Open Gate (doubles from £85 B\u0026ampB), which also offers organised retreats. For a more secular stay, head to the Manor House Hotel  (doubles from £125 B\u0026ampB) and enjoy local seafood and views of the abbey ruins.Carol Donaldson is author of On the Marshes, an exploration of the wetlands of north Kent This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

We’ve got Housewives, Bad Girls, Teen Moms, and don’t even get me started on 2004’s The Swan. We’re responsible for so much of the worst stuff on TV it’s honestly shocking that we’re allowed to call this current era our “Golden Age of Television” considering what we’re actively putting out into the world. But maybe that’s why I love Love Island, airing on Hulu in the US. It’s the UK’s way of being like, we see you, America, and we can do better. (Or, perhaps, worse.)From our perspective, it’s like you’ve taken Bachelor in Paradise (the BachelorBachelorette’s beach-themed spin-off show, featuring the motley crew of BachelorBachelorette alumni) mixed it with Big Brother (which, to be fair, was yours to begin with) and added a heavy pour of Paradise Hotel (a short-lived show that also featured hotties sharing hotel rooms on their first dates.) I must say, it’s nice to know that the “Can I steal him for a sec?” bit they repeat on The Bachelor applies across the pond. But the added element of the show airing every day – practically in real time – is a genius twist. Binge watching may be on trend, but there’s something about an entire nation watching something unfold together that creates not only mass hysteria, but hundreds of Daily Mail headlines. With so much TV to watch, we’re rarely all watching the same thing (at the same time!) anymore. Love Island, as silly as it may be, is a uniter. What’s the last show that had all of America on the same page: maybe Queer Eye? Lost? The second season of Survivor?Perhaps one of the best parts of Love Island is the steady stream of new blood. Our reality stars, used season after season (Jersey Shore Family Vacation, anyone?) are old hat compared to the revolving door of Love Island. It’s one hottie after another, and favorites are easy to come by with so many options. No one hits your fancy? In a few days there will be a new crop – pen salesmen, bartenders, doctors and, naturally, models. (What would a crop of young hot people be without a few models?) I’m more inclined to root for the “normal” people to find love, maybe I’m the only one who feels that way. When pen salesman Jack Fincham fell for aspiring actressbartender Dani Dyer (whose pedigree of being daughter of actor Danny Dyer means nothing to us over here, sorry) I was genuinely moved. When Love Island invented a whole new set of devious rules and games to keep them apart? I was genuinely angry! Much like a slew of Brits who called in to complain. It’s almost like we all forgot it was a reality show for a moment there.Another Big Brother-inspired move that takes Love Island to the next level is public voting. If it gives you Hunger Games vibes, that’s because it should. This is more than just a talent content. This season there was a challenge where the islanders have to read Twitter opinions of themselves: “Islanders, it’s time to find out how the viewers rate you as couples. If you can match the public’s perception, you can win a party tonight #CoupleGoals #PolesApart.” The stakes were low, and yet the game was terrifying. After not being voted “most loyal”, one of the contestants, Georgia, says: “I don’t understand why I was not in the loyal one when I’ve been loyal the whole time I’ve been in here … How am I not loyal?” Despite there being no phones or contact with the outside world allowed, the producers of Love Island manage to forcibly break that fourth wall and let the audience have a say in these peoples’ romantic futures. It’s one of the more devious reality show moves we’ve seen in quite some time.There’s also a weird raw truth to what plays out on Love Island that certainly applies to dating in America – despite it’s producers’ best efforts to create surface level juicy storylines. Because contestants are constantly asked about what their “type” is, and whether someone is or is not that, only on Love Island will the not-as-muscled doctor fail to couple up despite his best efforts (“He’s not tan enough!” one of the women says in season four’s premiere episode), or, perhaps more close to home, that the only black woman will excuse herself from the show because she’s just not anyone’s “type”. Even though these people spend hours together after first meeting, there’s barely any emphasis on getting to know each other beyond a “type”, thinking that perhaps you could get along and maybe even find love despite not fitting each other’s mold.Watching Love Island can also make you feel like you’re a cultural critic, peering over the fence between America and the UK, observing their mating rituals. Of course the dial is turned up to 11, but it’s fun to say things like: “Oh, is that how they ask each other out over there?”, “There’s got to be more queer people than this” and “What the hell does dicksand mean?”Another show I’m quite fond of is Japan’s Terrace House, which recently made its way on to Netflix in the US. It’s the opposite of Love Island: there’s no prize, no games, no viewer participation, no emphasis on hot bodies, and it often takes weeks for housemates to ask each other out on dates. But it’s fascinating to watch how people in different cultures take on sex and dating – whether it’s over the top like Love Island, or the other direction. It’s exaggerated reality TV, but there’s truth in both of these shows.But maybe what’s so fun about watching Love Island as an American, all the way over here in America, is the lack of context. It’s almost as if I’m the one without a cell phone, cut off from news cycles and isolated from the greater conversation about the show. Protected from think pieces on race and gender and what it really means when a contestant named Hayley doesn’t know what Brexit is. There’s something a bit freeing about that.I guess what I’m trying to say is: congrats England, you did it. You made a show worth getting all up in arms for, worth seeking out on illegal streaming sites, worth reading about in the Daily Mail again and again. Sure, I hope we never get our own Love Island (we have enough stuff to deal with over here, honestly) but I will continue to struggle to keep up with yours.

The series, made in cooperation with Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, examines in forensic, harrowing and often exasperating detail the shooting on 26 February 2012 of the unarmed 17-year-old, which Zimmerman says was in self-defence, while the boy was walking through a gated community in Sanford, Florida. It also explores its momentous repercussions, both personal and national.And in a tail-swallowing media moment, those repercussions include the documentary-makers’ own run-ins with Zimmerman, who emerges as the opposite of a reformed character. In the intervening years, Zimmerman has been arrested for domestic violence, alleged to have used racist language and seen bragging about killing Martin. He even attempted to auction the gun on eBay.Dennis Warren, the private investigator hired by the flim-makers to contact Zimmerman and his relatives, is currently suing him for stalking. Zimmerman allegedly bombarded Warren with threatening phone calls, texts, voice messages and emails. In a sickening reference to his killing of Martin, Zimmerman boasted to another interviewer: “I know how to handle people who fuck with me. I have since February 2012.”As it happens, Jay-Z also knows how to handle people who fuck with him. Guesting on DJ Khaled’s recent track Top Off, he spat, “Meanwhile Georgie Porgie sinnin’ and sendin’ me threats Save your breath, you couldn’t beat a flight of steps Try that shit with a grown man I’ll kill that fuckboy with my own hand.”But Jay-Z’s real response is the docuseries itself. It is both an angry indictment and a gripping real-life legal thriller, but at the same time a necessary examination of a tragedy that exposed the United States’s flaws and faultlines, societal and institutional – in the same way that the murder of Stephen Lawrence did in the UK, two decades earlier.As with Lawrence, the story gets worse the closer you zoom in. The trial itself is a catalogue of almost farcical errors and oddities, from Zimmerman’s defence lawyer opening with a knock-knock joke, to the excruciating humiliation of Martin’s best friend over her literacy abilities, from a key-witness coroner who proudly announced he had “zero memory” of Martin’s autopsy, to the ill-advised introduction of a life-sized dummy into the courtroom.And cutting through it all is the palpable pain of Martin’s family – their grief compounded by their sense of injustice. “I trusted that the system was going to work,” says his brother Jahvaris Fulton. “And it didn’t.”Martin’s killing was the moment the whole country realised the system wasn’t working. In particular, the case brought attention to the controversial “stand your ground” law, backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), justifying the use of deadly force in self-defence – which has heavily favoured white shooters of black people. In the broader sense, Martin’s case presaged America’s current racial and political isions. For a brief, wishful moment after the election of Barack Obama, the country imagined itself a post-racial society, but as the final episode of Rest in Power lays out, it was really just a few short steps away from riots in Ferguson, Missouri, the NFL kneeling protests, and the far-right marching through Charlottesville chanting white nationalist slogans with the tacit endorsement of Donald Trump.“A lot of these issues are in the very bedrock of America. This is about America’s original sin. This is about a global capitalist ideology of racism and where it leads us,” says Jenner Furst, who co-directed Rest in Power with Julia Willoughby Nason. “There was a black president in America, but young African Americans had the sad realisation there were going to be far more Trayvon Martins than Barack Obamas.”Something else the Trayvon Martin story kick-started was a new era of consciousness, protest and activism in relation to civil rights injustices – what we would now call “Woke America”.The term now feels overused, but in 2012 few of us either knew it or lived it, which is an indication of how woke we have become. Public outrage at Zimmerman’s acquittal catalysed the formation of Black Lives Matter. Fuelled by social media, the movement has only grown nationwide in the face of subsequent slayings of young black men, often at the hands of law enforcement. But this awakening also permeated into the broader culture – cinema, television and music. As activist Philip Agnew puts it: “It became particularly uncool to not talk about what was going on in the world.”Jay-Z was never exactly politically disengaged – he performed at Barack Obama’s inauguration, for instance – but he has also begun to address racial justice more overtly in recent years. His 2017 track The Story of OJ, for example, spoke about race and wealth, with an accompanying cartoon video parodying vintage African-American stereotypes. And, like many hip-hop moguls, he has erted some of his energies and funds towards activism, including producing. Where before he executive-produced movies such as The Great Gatsby and the Annie remake, he has moved on to backing black history projects. “Now is the time to recognize that through our voices we really can effect change,” Jay-Z wrote in The Hollywood Reporter last June.Furst and Nason’s paths first crossed with Jay-Z via their previous docuseries about Kalief Browder – another innocent young black man whose life ended tragically. A foster child from the Bronx, Browder was arrested in 2010, aged 16, on suspicion of stealing a backpack. He denied any involvement but was jailed at the notoriously violent Rikers Island detention centre in New York. He spent three years there, most of it in solitary confinement, awaiting a trial that was repeatedly deferred and eventually collapsed owing to a lack of evidence or witnesses. Two years after his eventual release, Browder committed suicide.Jay-Z befriended Kalief Browder after he was freed from jail. He invited Browder to his offices and gave him words of encouragement. So when Furst and Nason approached Jay-Z, having spent six months developing their project with Browder’s family, he immediately agreed to back it, which he did in partnership with the Weinstein Company. With Rest in Power, the situation was reversed – Jay-Z acquired the rights to the book by Trayvon Martin’s parents, and then took them to Furst and Nason.Furst and Nason are in their mid-30s but they are already veterans of this scene. Furst has spent the past decade working on urban, political documentaries, including Newark-based series Brick City, and the Robert Redford-produced Chicagoland, on which Nason worked as a stills photographer. They are keenly aware of their status as white film-makers operating in this sphere. “The biggest takeaway for us is, as white Americans, we need to do more to surrender our privilege. We need to encourage everyone around us to recognise that, no matter how many years have passed, a white American will never feel the same issues that an African American does.”Being white did at least enable the film-makers to “infiltrate” the other side of the Trayvon Martin story. White interviewees tended to drop their guard with them, they say. There is a bizarre interview in the final episode, for example, with Andy Hallinan, owner of a Florida gun store that made headlines for refusing to serve Muslims. Zimmerman subsequently befriended Hallinan, and asked him to sell his Confederate flag paintings. Hallinan happily explains to the camera how Zimmerman described African-American people as “monkeys”, though when he argues that the Confederate flag is not a racist symbol, and that the US civil war was fought on other issues apart from slavery, we hear Furst’s voice off-camera asking him to name three other things the war was about. Hallinan is stumped.Documentaries have already been a key part of the new, politically engaged US, and both Rest in Power and Time: The Kalief Browder Story join a host of recent works dealing with facets of the same American malaise. Ava DuVernay’s 13th and Eugene Jarecki’s The House That I Live In, for example, on the prison-industrial complex and its racist bias. Or the Oscar-winning OJ: Made in America and I Am Not Your Negro, offering a historical perspective on today’s race landscape. Or Whose Streets?, an in-depth study of the Ferguson riots.Trayvon Martin’s death has similarly prompted change already, but if there’s one thing Furst and Nason hope their documentary will come to bear on, it is the “stand your ground” laws, which now operate in more than 30 US states.“Here’s one thing you can focus on that for some reason has escaped all reforms,” says Furst. “And you need to understand how it was formed, the people who helped create it, what their intention was – which was to sell more guns – and how politicians around America rubber-stamped this bill.”Nason adds: “The constitution was written by essentially white supremacists. It’s very hard to break that chain that has a grip around our criminal justice system today.”Martin’s parents have become highly active, especially in supporting parents of victims of gun and racial violence. Speaking alongside them in Florida earlier this year, Jay-Z described Trayvon Martin as “a beacon of light”, saying: “His name will sit alongside some of the greats who lost their lives to push our culture forward. The Martin Luther Kings, the Gandhis … ”It is a reminder that social change often comes about through the telling of personal stories – usually the ones that didn’t have a happy ending.“One human being, like Trayvon Martin or Kalief Browder, can tell the story of the entire injustice of what it means to be black in our criminal justice system,” says Furst. “And how it’s a continuation of slavery. Black bodies, as they were at the time of slavery, are still a commodity that’s traded and sold, and that’s a really powerful thing to expose to people who are either ignorant of it or in denial of it.”Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story will air on the Paramount Network later in the year "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22609626a2c7515ef8d992af16796144c3aa38af/340_243_4543_2726/master/4543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a8209985f15965c58a0ce741c428da4","title":"jean claude juncker seeks deal on free movement of pets","story":"European commission president has taken a personal interest in pet passport scheme While negotiators frantically thrash around for a solution to the Irish border or a trade deal that will avoid economic armageddon, Jean-Claude Juncker has kept his eye on another big Brexit issue.The European commission president, the proud owner of a pooch called Plato, has taken a personal interest in the fate of the pet passport scheme, under which animals in good health can be exempted from going into quarantine as they travel around Europe.With a no-deal scenario looking increasingly likely, Mina Andreeva, a commission spokeswoman, disclosed that advice to pet owners would be published in the coming months, after Juncker highlighted the urgency of the matter “several times”.Plato, who was rescued from a Greek island by a German organisation, lives with Juncker in his home country of Luxembourg, where, the commission president has joked, Plato ignores commands because he has yet to master French.“This is indeed an important issue that we take seriously and will require preparedness,” Andreeva said.“I think President Juncker, having personally mentioned the issue several times, then it is something that is very close to his heart, so we are not only for the free movement of people, but for the free movement of pets.”Currently a dog, cat or even a pet ferret travelling from the UK to the EU and back again can do so without being quarantined, as long as they have a passport and have been microchipped.The passports prove an animal has been vaccinated against rabies, had a blood test to check the inoculation has worked, and been dewormed.But 250,000 British cats and dogs, and many more from the rest of Europe, may need to be locked up for a period each time they travel after Brexit, should the negotiations between the UK and EU end in failure. P\u0026ampO Ferries alone carries more than 20,000 pets a year from Dover to Calais.Last year, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, admitted: “A failure of the negotiations would have many consequences, including the ability of dogs and cats to cross the Channel.”The UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, who owns a bichon frise called Snowy and a Lhasa Apsowire-haired dachshund cross called Muffin, has insisted there will not be a problem, even if Brexit talks fail.

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party had complained that its election chances were badly hurt long before polling got under way. More than 30 of its candidates left the party during the campaign and many alleged privately that they had been pressured by Pakistan’s ISI spy agency.After a meeting of six opposition parties on Friday Hamza Shahbaz Sharif, leader of the PML-N, said he would decide on Sunday whether or not to boycott parliament, stopping short of endorsing a demand for a re-election raised by five other smaller parties.The meeting was called to discuss opposition party leaders’ response after all claimed the vote had been rigged and that their polling agents – workers who keep an eye on the count – had been evicted from ballot booths by security officials.Sharif said he would discuss the call to reject the result with party leadership. In his speech, Gahler advised all parties to pursue rigging allegations through legal channels, saying that his team, which visited 582 of 85,000 polling stations, had seen no evidence of military interference.The PTI enjoyed success across the country, official results showed on Friday. With two seats left to count, more than a day after the result was due, the PTI had won 117 seats in the national assembly, the PML-N had taken 64 and the Pakistan People’s party 43.Khan will still need to form a coalition to become prime minister, which requires at least 137 seats, but a single party winning contests across the country – in the north, south and in Punjab – is rare in Pakistani politics.The ease with which the PTI can implement its policy agenda also received a significant boost from its strong performance in state-level elections.As well as forming the federal government, the PTI’s capture of 118 seats in the provincial assembly of Punjab, the largest and wealthiest province, means it has a good chance of evicting the PML-N from the state government there, a stronghold that its leadership had been desperate to protect.In a televised victory speech on Thursday, Khan struck a unifiying tone, pledging to lift up the poor and allow rigging claims to be investigated.Sharif, who founded the PML-N, told his family from the prison cell where he is serving a 10-year sentence for corruption that he considered the result “stolen”.Gen Asif Ghafoor, the army’s spokesperson, was criticised after tweeting: “You honour who You will and You humble who You will”, a verse from the Qur’an that was taken in some quarters as confirmation of the military’s support for Khan.The trickle of official results threw up surprises. Senior PML-N leaders performed worse than expected. The former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who took up the role after the ousting of Sharif, lost the two constituencies he was contesting.The former finance minister Miftah Ismail posted on Twitter that he was “looking for work” after his defeat. Shahbaz Sharif, Nawaz’s brother and the new leader of the party, scraped into parliament after losing three of the four seats he contested.Also known as the Justice party, it is led by the former cricketer\u0026nbspImran Khan, and has had some success at provincial level but has never been able to convert it into national power. Khan has been accused both of lacking a coherent political philosophy and of sympathising with extremists. He has described the Taliban’s fight in Afghanistan as a\u0026nbspholy war, and accused “liberals” who support Nato’s war on the group of being\u0026nbsp“thirsty for blood”.Hopes to win control of parliament again, even though its leader, Nawaz Sharif, is in prison for corruption. Tried and\u0026nbspsentenced\u0026nbspin absentia, he returned to the country this month to serve his sentence, hoping to revitalise the campaign before the election.Now led by Sharif’s brother Shahbaz, the party is focusing on its economic success and promises of energy and infrastructure investment from China. However, efforts to increase tax revenues have faltered.Led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The party lost ground after Benazir was killed in 2007 but the family name still carries considerable weight. The third-generation leader appears to be playing a long game, rebuilding support in its heartland with an eye on future elections. If it does well in this vote, the PPP could potentially serve as a junior partner in a coalition.Although Tehreek-e-Labbaik, a new far-right Islamist party dedicated to killing blasphemers, failed to win any national seats, its strong second place in many contests raised fears that it will influence the future of Pakistani politics.The political analyst Umair Javed told the  that the scale of Khan’s win across the country made the PTI a rare, “truly national party”. It won a two-thirds majority in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the first since 1951, while at the other end of Pakistan, in the southern business capital of Karachi, the party vastly outperformed expectations to claim half the seats.That might reflect a shift away from ethnicity-based politics in both regions, said Javed.The former PML-N cabinet minister Khawaja Saad Rafique petitioned for a recount after his defeat to Khan in the Punjab capital of Lahore. He said the presiding officer at the polling station “rejected” many votes. At a party meeting on Thursday, the PML-N decided against boycotting parliament."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3578548.1532732843!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ocean current changes could alter irish climate for two decades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBetween 2014 and 2017,  the world has experienced the four warmest years on record. Photograph:  StringerReutersA weakening of major ocean currents in the Northern Atlantic, including the Gulf Stream that warms Ireland, could trigger a sudden change to Ireland’s climate that could last for two decades, Irish scientists have warned.Rather than leading to a period of cooling, however, it could result in rapid temperature increases across the country, according to the Maynooth University team.Such changes could have disastrous outcomes for the global climate and make the urgent need to deal with climate change more difficult, the team declares, in research published by the journal Nature.The North Atlantic Ocean’s circulation system, responsible for Ireland’s relatively mild climate, has weakened, and is expected to weaken further in coming decades with potentially devastating consequences.Strong ocean circulation has traditionally been associated with higher temperatures and sluggish circulation with cooler temperatures, but new research is challenging that view.Dr Gerard McCarthy and Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth’s Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units (ICARUS) analysed research by Professors Xianyao Chen of the Ocean University of China and Ka-Kit Tung of the University of Washington.The research investigated ocean currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) where warm water flows northwards on the surface with a southward flow of colder, deeper waters.The best-known of these currents in Ireland is the Gulf Stream, which has long been widely recognised as protecting Ireland from extreme weather and giving the country its famous wet and mild climate.Globally, the AMOC has been seen as a vigorous force associated with elevated surface temperatures across the Atlantic, but the new research highlights its role in storing heat in the deep ocean”.The AMOC is now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years. Past AMOC changes have been associated with abrupt climate changes. Global surface temperatures rose steadily from 1975 to 1998, but growth then slowed for 15 years.Between 2014 and 2017, however, the world has experienced the four warmest years on record: “Interest in this hiatus and what caused it has, therefore, waned considerably,” Dr McCarthy explained.However, climate change is a complex response to slowly-varying external factors, so “it is essential to re-examine and try to fully understand previous climate behaviour and its underlying causes”, say the Irish duo.The Chinese research may hold the key to explaining this hiatus, and that understanding the mechanics behind it can help us prepare for future climate change.Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are increasing at an unprecedented rate, something which is widely understood as driving global warming.Chen and Tung argue that half of the heat arising from such gases is stored in the deep waters of the North Atlantic when the AMOC is strong, which reduces overall global warming.The 19751998 lull, when the AMOC was robust and strengthening, may explain the reduction in global warming that took place because it was “so effectively” able to transfer heat deep into the ocean, Dr McCarthy said.Now, however, the AMOC will “very likely” weaken in coming decades. Indeed, the Atlantic has seen muted rises in surface temperatures relative to the global ocean over the past few decades.Scientists have already observed that the AMOC is weakened and that “the Atlantic is surprisingly cold suggesting that it is not effectively storing heat in its lower levels”.If rapid global surface warming on sea and land results, this could “have disastrous outcomes for the global climate and make navigating the challenges of global climate change even more difficult”, Dr McCarthy added."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hindu temples in India close due to belief that eclipse causes negative energyCourts Service says media to get wider access to court documents from August 1stFather-of-two who was in his early 30s died after a stabbing near Newry on Thursday\u0026lsquoI don\u0026rsquot expect my own house to burn down but I still insure it because it could happen\u0026rsquoWater restrictions extended another month as levels \u0026lsquocritically\u0026rsquo lowDepartment of Housing urges councils to acquire vacant properties for social housingCalls on Minister to release Dr Bassam Naser, jailed for tax evasion, on compassionate groundsMemo reveals charity considered property sale and office closures to avert funding crisisState bid to settle CervicalCheck trial criticised for offering cover to Varadkar, HarrisWeakening of Gulf Stream could result in rapid temperature increasesBatch of Tropicana Trop 50 Multivitamins Juice also recalledCourt hears that the four incidents by now 18-year-old were very violent and aggressiveGareth Hutch, nephew of \u0026lsquothe monk\u0026rsquo, was shot dead getting into his car in Dublin in 2016Five chicks hatched in one nest, conservationist have saidGirls were six or seven when they were molested\u0026lsquoThe mirror is my enemy.

Photograph: North West NespixFormer Northern Ireland first minister Peter Robinson believes the North should prepare for the possibility of a united Ireland.Speaking at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal, Mr Robinson said he does not think Northern Ireland will want to leave the UK but that is no reason it shouldn’t prepare for the eventuality.“I don’t expect my own house to burn down but I still insure it because it could happen,” he said.The former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he would accept the results of a border poll which led to Northern Ireland joining the Republic.“As soon as that decision is taken every democrat will have to accept that decision,” he said in response to a question from the audience.He said walking towards that scenario without preparation is madness and compared it to the decision to leave the EU.“I don’t believe Northern Ireland will want to leave the United Kingdom, but if it does happen we would be in a terrible fix because we would be in the same situation as leaving the EU where nothing was negotiated or decided about what was going to happen after.”Mr Robinson said he believed the unionist community in general would also accept the results of a border poll on unification but would want some “protections”, as the Nationalist community currently enjoys in the North.On the subject of Brexit, Mr Robinson said the Republic’s relationship with the North and with the UK mainland will never be the same again. He warned these relationships could become “toxic” if “the Northern Ireland Assembly, its Executive, along with the north-south and east-west institutions” are not restored.“Without each and all of those parts being in place, and working, relationships will suffer – perhaps drastically.”He warned the east-west relationship between the UK and the Republic “will struggle to maintain anything close to the warmth of their pre-Brexit affinity” no matter what deal is made.“At worst that relationship may become stony and staid and, in extreme circumstances, even perfunctory and fruitless.”He said he believes UK Government ministers see the Irish Government as “rigid if not antagonistic” and that this has “planted the seeds of regression in the relationship between the two countries.“Do not be fooled by diplomatic, understated Whitehall-speak. They are not happy with Dublin.”Mr Robinson said the Irish Government’s approach to Brexit has also been poorly received by the unionist community in Northern Ireland.“From a unionist perspective, it need only be stated to be accepted that there has been a rapid deterioration in their estimation of the Irish Government.“Unionists believe Dublin has been completely self-serving and unnecessarily bellicose during this process. I believe the absence of a working north-south institution has exacerbated the situation.”He continued: “Moreover, there is a feeling that at no point has there been any consideration of the effect and force of their words and actions upon the unionist population.”Asked by an audience member about the Renewable Heating Initiative (RHI) scandal, which led to the collapse of the Stormont Assembly, Mr Robinson said ministers must take many decisions every day.“I suspect that if any government decision, anywhere in the world, was put under the kind of scrutiny that the RHI decision is having, politicians anywhere might not come out too well.”He said there is no reason Stormont cannot get back on track while issues like the RHI and the Irish Language Act are dealt with in parallel and on a strict timeline.Asked about his DUP colleague Ian Paisley Junior, who has been suspended from Westminster for failing to declare two trips to Sri Lanka that were paid for by its government who we was lobbying for at the time, Mr Robinson said “the least I say about that matter the better”.“The House of Commons has investigated, he’s put his hands up, he’s recognised he did wrong, he’s apologised for it, and the party, through its own internal structure, will have its decision to take.”Discover more of the ideas debated in Glenties this year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3577461.1532643917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit talks are almost out of time but is an extension possible","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA placard outside the Houses of Parliament. Photograph: Simon Dawson\u0026nbsp“The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.” – – Article 50 (3), Lisbon TreatyYes, the UK can seek an extension to its EU membership beyond March 31st to facilitate discussions on its stalled Withdrawal Agreement. If, that is, all the member states agree to such an extension.All this talk in Brussels and London of time running out, of insuperable obstacles like the Irish backstop, and the real possibility of a “no-deal” Brexit has given currency to the idea of an extension.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have both suggested in recent days that they would be open to the idea, although London has preferred instead to talk of accelerating or invigorating the talks, as if a reluctant Brussels is responsible for negotiations foot-dragging. Ha!Many Brexiteers now say privately, however, that almost any concession by London on the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) – not including a border in the Irish Sea – should be contemplated just to get the UK out of the EU on March 31st. Freedom! So the idea of extending UK membership is likely to be politically toxic in the Tory party.It would certainly be portrayed as the first step in betraying the Brexit cause, an incremental remain.Another way of circumventing the backstop roadblock, London would say, would be to kick discussions on it out of the WA framework and into the transition period when the UK will have left the EU but talks on the shape of a future relationship will be getting under way. The Border issue, they have always argued, is more easily resolved in the context of an overall settlement of that relationship.But seductive as that transition option might be – it was apparently advocated by a Polish minister last week – it remains completely unacceptable to the Irish and EU negotiators. It might appear simply to be another version of the article 50 extension breathing space for talks, but in truth it is a horse of an entirely different colour.Removing the backstop issue from the WA, which has to be ratified by the member states and the European Parliament, would be necessary for the issue to be kicked forward to transition.That would represent both a formal repudiation of a key element of the joint accord reached in December between the EU task force and the UK, and, just as importantly, a dangerous backsliding on a previously agreed policy that would inevitably call into question all agreed outcomes in the talks.The corollary of the principle that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” is that the process can also not involve endless renegotiation of settled matters.Crucially, the separation of the backstop issue from the WA would remove important leverage on the EU side, fatally undermining its ability to safeguard the special position of Northern Ireland. The UK needs a WA to have any prospect of an orderly Brexit and the vital transition. That means it must now, not later, face up to hard choices – notably some controls on the Irish Sea – or lose everything in a painful no-deal, no-transition exit.That much was again made abundantly clear to the Poles at the ministerial meeting last week when, once again, many member states rallied round the Irish. It is believed that they would not, however, stand in the way of an article 50 extension.That, however politically unpalatable in London, would simply allow more time for the WA to be agreed, undermining none of the previously made undertakings. And none of the hard choices for the UK.For the time being, however, London is not asking. Two months of unproductive summer discussions, with an October summit deal in doubt, may well bring a different perspective.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: John MacDougallIt started on a drizzly June day in 1979, when 500 people holding home-made signs marched past surprised West Berliners.On Saturday, half a million people are expected to brave 33-degree heat to march in the 40th anniversary Christopher Street Day, Germany biggest gay pride parade.Behind the sweaty glitter and sparkling wine, however, campaigners in Europe’s gay mecca are sounding the alarm. A year after Germany secured marriage equality, community leaders see indications of rising apathy – even anger – towards homosexuals.“There’s this strange mood in German society now, with people saying ‘you got marriage equality, what else do you want?’” said Johannes Kram, author of a new book called “I’ve Nothing Against Gays, But . . .”Behind the “but” he sees what he calls a “terribly civilised homophobia” of people who denounce homosexuals in public as a privileged elite, spoiled in recent years at the expense of the working class or other deprived groups.“As part of this new narrative,” said Kram, “those that threaten us – usually straight men who have problems with their own sexuality – are portraying themselves as an oppressed victim group who cannot express how they feel.”Despite Berlin’s largely liberal and tolerant culture, gay counselling and victim support centre Maneo notices a rise in numbers seeking its services.It dealt with 800 cases last year and, of 407 it was able to analyse more closely, found that 324 fulfilled their definition of homophobic or transphobic attacks: physical attacks, verbal abuse and theft.No representative surveys are possible as many victims are reluctant to come forward, making it impossible to quantify the real scale of homophobia, let alone whether it is growing or falling.“But the figures we have show we still have a shocking daily reality, despite everything,” said Bastian Fink, head of Maneo.Germany is where the modern idea of homosexuality was born, thanks to pioneering Weimar-era researcher Magnus Hirschfeld. But the road to equality began only half a century ago when Germany – East and West – decriminalised homosexuality, with age of consent equalised only in 1994.Nazi-era convictions against homosexuals were overturned in 2002, but post-war convictions only in 2016. Last year, the Bundestag voted in favour of marriage equality but, unlike the lengthy Irish debate and referendum, Germany’s parliamentary vote came out of nowhere: triggered by a throwaway remark by chancellor Angela Merkel, who herself voted against it.The progressive cultural shift is visible in Berlin’s police force, once an enemy of the gay community, now with dedicated community outreach workers. Last year, Berlin police registered 164 cases of hate crimes with homo- or transsexual victims, the same number as the previous year.“These numbers don’t mean we are Europe’s capital of homophobia or transphobia,” warned Anne Griesbach-Baerns, police commissioner for LGBTI affairs. “It means people are daring to come forward. But as we step up our community contact we expect those figures to rise further.”A heated subject of debate is the threat to the gay community, real or perceived, from conservative Turkish and Arab men, and criminal gangs from Romania and Bulgaria.The culture clash is particularly obvious in multicultural neighbourhoods like Neukölln, where groups of Arab-speaking men sit outside shisha bars across the road from gay bars. “The mood has got worse in the last two years,” said Maurus Knowles, a gay bar owner here who has been attacked himself and fears the mood is “beginning to tip”.Some point to the 2015-2016 arrival of more than one million migrants – many raised in homophobic cultures in Afghanistan, Syria and northern Africa – and a 12 per cent rise in hate crimes against homosexuals in the same period.But German police warn against oversimplification, saying by far the largest group behind homophobic attacks are German men under 30.Back at the Maneo centre, 28 years in business, manager Bastian Fink warns of viewing Berlin as a gay El Dorado.“Even in liberal Berlin people ask themselves on the street, ‘Do I hold my boyfriend’s hand or not?’” he said. “As long as people still have to adapt their behaviour to their surroundings it’s disastrous for us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Eurotunnel, ferry and plane passengers hit with lengthy delays amid heat and thunderstormsUK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipseComment: Cocaine is the new plastic.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban unconditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. UK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipseComment: Cocaine is the new plastic.

Well, more precisely, with a single planet: Mercury.For most of those acquainted with the phenomenon of the planet Mercury going retrograde, it is little more than a planetary optical illusion.It occurs when the closest planet to the sun appears to be going backwards in the sky, as it will for the next few weeks.But for the astrologically-minded it augurs an altogether more sinister interval where they need to be careful what they say and avoid starting serious undertakings.The period, which starts around today, is already causing consternation among some on social media who are wary of the baleful effects of Mercury going into reverse.As an astronomical phenomenon, a planet goes retrograde when it gives the appearance that it is going backwards.Planets cross the night sky from west to east, which is known as a prograde motion. The illusion that a planet suddenly reverses direction happens when a faster moving planet catches up with it.It is the planetary equivalent of a slower train appearing to go backwards to a passenger in a faster train as it passes by.Mercury appears to be going backwards when it is passed by a faster planetMercury goes retrograde three times a year and the illusion lasts for around three weeks.The planet derives its astrological significance from the Roman messenger god Mercury and thus represents communication and expression.When the planet goes retrograde, it can signal a time for the astrologically-inclined when miscommunications and disagreements will abound.More latterly, it has also been read as a generally inauspicious time to start any undertaking and one when important purchases or endeavours should be avoided, or at least carefully scrutinised.Essentially, for the next three weeks try to keep your counsel, don’t make any huge life decisions and this is definitely not the time to consider texting an ex.Astrologers warn that retrograde Mercury is a period to be careful with your communicationsSome are so concerned by this period that there is a website, ismercuryinretrograde, dedicated simply to telling people whether Mercury is retrograde or not.Astrologer Susan Miller has warned on her blog that a retrograde Mercury can be a harbinger of “pandemonium”.“Therefore, while Mercury naps, the activities that it governs don’t have the benefit of a well-functioning, wide-awake planet to supervise them. Expect a certain degree of pandemonium to ensue!She added: “Don’t make any important moves when Mercury is retrograde. Nothing will be settled successfully for the future during these periods anyway – you will find it nearly impossible to nail down a plan.“During a retrograde period, it is hard to get decisions from others. Even if a decision is made, it will be subject to change, either just after Mercury turns to direct motion or much later.”The practice of people trying to ine earthly developments from studying the stars goes back to the earliest human civilisations, with the first strong evidence coming from the Babylonians circa 2000BC.By the Classical period it had a mixed reputation, with some Roman emperors having an imperial astrologer at their courts but at other times it was viewed as a malign form of magic.The practice enjoyed a resurgence in medieval times when doctors often carried charts with them so they could check the position of the stars before making a diagnosis.An undated painting showing Christopher Columbus arriving at one of the Caribbean islands on his voyage of discoveryBut it has also periodically been a source of chicanery, as Christopher Columbus once used his knowledge of when a blood moon would occur to convince a tribe of recalcitrant Caribbean indians that their god was angry with them for not providing him with food.Meanwhile, the Aztecs read the celestial signs to mean that they had to regularly cut the beating hearts out of live sacrificial victims from neighbouring civilisations to appease the sun.It is estimated that as many as 20,000 prisoners were subjected to this excruciating death every year.Please review our commenting policyEurotunnel, ferry and plane passengers hit with lengthy delays amid heat and thunderstormsUK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipseComment: Cocaine is the new plastic.

However, the company’s forecast for third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of\u0026nbsp$235m (£179m)\u0026nbspis lower than the analyst average estimate of\u0026nbsp$268m\u0026nbsp(£204m).Although Twitter is confident that their efforts are in the best long-term interest of the platform, the declines have raised concerns among investors in the company.As President Trump’s favoured outlet of communication, the fear is that the platform will not be able to attract general audience users, according to Bloomberg.“Despite Trump being perhaps the most high-profile user possible, usage has not dramatically improved over the past couple of years,” Benjamin Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities wrote to investors before the earnings were released.However, Twitter doesn’t measure success by monthly visitors - instead highlighting daily active users as the best measure, which has increased by 11 per cent from a year earlier.The increase marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year increases, according to Bloomberg.The company’s recent product updates and changes, such as live video streaming, have also made a difference in revenue - as advertising is easier than ever on the platform.11 useful Twitter features you might not know about111 Turn on Night ModeTwitter’s dark blue Night Mode is a lot easier on your eyes than its regular, vibrant theme.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil? Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?DH\u0026nbspLawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Peshmerga recruits, some of whom are volunteers, aim their AK-47s as they take part in military training (AFPGetty)Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an orbit of 16 years, they knew it would return close to the black hole in 2018.Over 20 years, the accuracy of their instruments has improved and so in May 2018, they were able to take extremely precise measurements in conjunction with scientists from around the world.This showed the star\u0027s orbital velocity increasing to more than 25 million kph (15.5 million mph) as it approached the black hole.The star\u0027s wavelength stretched as it sought to escape the gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole, shifting its appearance from blue to red, Odele Straub from the Paris Observatory said.The scientists now hope to observe other theories of black hole physics, she said.This is the first step on a long road that the team has done over many years and which we hope to continue in the next years, MPE\u0027s Reinhard Genzel, who led the international team, said.Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/13/20/roger-stone.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/13/20/roger-stone.jpg","title":"julian assange ecuador embassy removal asylum latest london","story":"Created with Sketch.President says nobody should remain under asylum \u0027for too long\u0027 as he reveals discussions with BritainClick to followThe Independent OnlineAssange will be removed from London embassy \u0027eventually\u0027, Ecuador saysThe president of Ecuador says Julian Assange must leave his country’s London embassy “eventually”, revealing discussions are underway with British authorities to end his asylum.Lenin Moreno cast doubts over how much longer the WikiLeaks founder’s six-year stay\u0026nbspat the embassy could last after he announced talks had resumed\u0026nbspto facilitate his exit.Ecuador granted Mr Assange asylum in 2012 in order to avoid his extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex assault allegations, which he has always denied.The case has since been dropped, although the Australian-born programmer would still be arrested by British police for breaching bail conditions.He also fears\u0026nbspextradition to the United States, where he could be tried for the leaking of classified US state department documents.Mr Moreno said nobody should remain under asylum “for too long” and Mr Assange would “eventually need to leave” the embassy.He added any eviction would come as the result of negotiations involving all sides and hinge on whether Mr Assange’s life could be guaranteed.The president also insisted he had no sympathy for Mr Assange’s political agenda as a leaker of confidential documents.“I have never been in favour of Mr Assange\u0027s activity,” he said, speaking at an event in Madrid where he met with King Felipe and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, following a three-day trip to London.When asked if he had spoken to British authorities about Mr Assange’s situation during his stay, he said the countries remained in constant contact over the matter.“The only person I have never spoken to is Mr Assange,” he added.UK news in picturesThe scene on the A96 between Huntly and Keith in Moray where a five people have died and five more were injured after a crash between a minibus and a car.Anti-Brexit campaigners parked a removal van outside the Foreign Secretary\u0027s official home in central London in protest of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u0027s continued residence thereLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn during his visit to HS2 trains bidder Bombardier in Derby, following the launch of the party\u0027s new Build it in Britain campaignGreat Britain\u0027s Geraint Thomas cleans his eyes after tear gas was thrown at the pelaton during a farmers\u0027 protest who attempted to block the stage\u0027s route, during the 16th stage of the Tour de France, between Carcassonne and Bagneres-de-Luchon.

tired of the Assange situation and Mr Moreno earlier this year described the activist\u0026nbspas an “inherited problem” and “more than a nuisance”.His relationship with the Ecuadorean government is thought to have been strained further by his tweets in support of Catalan independence, which Quito believes is damaging ties with Madrid.In March, Ecuador announced it had cut Mr Assange’s internet

border","story":"Created with Sketch.UK making a deal \u0027impossible\u0027 with lack of proposals to solve borderClick to followIndy PoliticsEuropean parliament says it will veto Brexit deal over Theresa May ‘backsliding’ on Irish borderThe European parliament has dramatically upped the stakes in Brexit talks by threatening to veto any deal unless Theresa May comes up with new plans for the Northern Ireland border.The legislature’s Brexit steering group, made up of MEPs from across its parties, accused Theresa May of “backsliding” on the issue despite committing to prevent a hard border in December, and again in a letter in March.But the body, chaired by Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt, said the UK has failed to\u0026nbspcome up with a workable way to prevent a hard border and that by its actions it was making a deal “impossible”.“As recognised by the prime minister in her letter to President Tusk of 19 March 2018, the ‘backstop’ must avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protect the Good Friday Agreement and safeguard the integrity of the single market, customs union and common commercial policy,” the group said in a statement on Friday after the meeting.It adds: “The Brexit steering group\u0026nbspreiterates that in relation to the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbspit will accept no backsliding from past commitments, notably those entered into in the joint report of 8 December 2017”Despite the focus in the UK on the future trade relationship after Brexit, the Northern Ireland issue is the most likely to torpedo Brexit talks into no deal.\u0026nbspThe Brexit steering group stresses that without a credible, genuine and operational ‘backstop’, it will be impossible for the European Parliament to give its consent to the withdrawal agreementThe EU has said it would\u0026nbspnot agree to a withdrawal agreement without an “all-weather” backstop policy in place to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, but the UK says it will never accept a different policy being imposed in Northern Ireland to Great Britain and that any backstop must also be time-limited.The UK has said it hoped\u0026nbspto remove the need for a border by negotiating a future relationship that eliminated\u0026nbspthe need for checks on frontiers, but the Chequers white paper with this proposal\u0026nbspwas shot down by EU negotiators, who branded it unworkable.The UK has also proposed a “temporary customs arrangement” for the Northern Ireland border but the EU says it would not prevent a hard border.British diplomats have confirmed\u0026nbspthey currently have no plans to come up with extra proposals to prevent a border and that they hoped the Chequers white paper and temporary customs arrangement\u0026nbspwould together be acceptable to the EU.AFPGetty)Theresa May has dug her feet in on the issue and said “no UK prime minister” could accept a backstop.\u0026nbspShe is severely constrained in Westminster by the DUP, staunch unionists on whom she relies for a majority in the Commons, and Eurosceptics in her own party, who believe the EU proposals amount to an attempt to “annex” Northern Ireland. But senior cabinet sources\u0026nbspsay that the cabinet would be unlikely to agree to the plan anyway.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

This vote must include an option for an exit from Brexit.Vote Leave chief leaks \u0027fake news\u0027 report on misuse of dataOdds on second referendum and no-deal Brexit tumbleThis is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“I congratulate The Independent for joining this campaign. It’s both a brave and correct move.”Labour MP David Lammy, who has called for a second referendum since 2016, said: “The Independent’s new push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal sits, with other similar campaigns, on the right side of history.“Allowing the public to choose whether we remain in the EU – or indeed choose, in full knowledge, to become poorer, less sovereign and diplomatically neutered – is the only democratic solution to this political nightmare.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, campaigner Gina Miller and ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell have also backed the campaign.Theresa May has urged voters not to worry about Brexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March.But as a no-deal Brexit began to look more likely, Mr Blair took to Twitter to give his support to the campaign.He said: “33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines. It should be your #Finalsay.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Have you backed our campaign? Click here to sign our petition.Regardless of how you voted in the Brexit referendum, you deserve a say on the final deal.That’s why we’re launching the Final Say campaign, to win for the British people the right to make that all-important decision on the Brexit deal. Come what may in the months ahead, we maintain our commitment to our readers to retain balance and present many different points of view. But on this subject we believe a referendum on the final deal is right.We believe there are three reasons:1. The people, on both sides of the debate, are losing faith with the current process. From Theresa May to parliament as a whole, a chaotic approach has delivered infighting, resignations and party politics, but little progress on the key issues that people care about.2. The people on both sides should have the chance to finish what they started. With reality coming into focus, it’s only natural to check this future is what people really want. After years of negotiations behind closed doors, the people must not be shut out of the final decision.3. The people – on both sides – know so much more now than we did in 2016. The campaigns – again, on both sides – were flawed and clouded by misinformation. Many myths have been exposed. Now we must check there is support for the facts of Brexit.A full account of The Independent’s view is available here.In 2016, the people were given their say on the principle of whether to stay in the EU or leave. Now the facts are becoming clearer, it’s time for the people to have the final say on the real deal – before it’s too late.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/26/20/May.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/26/20/May.jpg","title":"final say brexit vote final deal students support poll theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0026nbsphas launched a\u0026nbspcampaign for the electorate to have a final say on the exit termsClick to followIndy PoliticsFinal say: Majority of students would support a vote on the final Brexit deal, new poll showsThe majority of students would back a vote on the final\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal, as some 70 per cent believe they will be worse off after leaving the EU, a new poll shows.Support among young voters for a new referendum has surged from 58 per cent in February 2017 to 67 per cent this month, according to a survey of undergraduates conducted by Youthsight, the UK\u0027s largest youth research group.The new poll found that seven out of 10 students think their prospects will change for the worse after Brexit, compared to 13 per cent who think they will be better off on leaving the EU.It comes as\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplaunched its\u0026nbspFinal Say\u0026nbspcampaign to call for a public vote on the Brexit deal, which attracted more than 200,000 supporters in the first 24 hours.The ongoing turmoil over Theresa May\u0027s Brexit approach has left\u0026nbsp77 per cent of students of the view the government is doing a bad job with\u0026nbspthe negotiations.Support for MPs determining the final deal has also fallen from 25 per cent in February 2017 to 17 per cent this month,\u0026nbspimplying that young people are increasingly losing faith in those in parliament’s ability to deliver a positive outcome.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit will affect the decision of 60 per cent of students likely to vote in a future general election, the survey shows, while half of those would be willing to vote tactically in the future in order to achieve their preferred Brexit outcome.The findings will heap pressure on Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s party over\u0026nbspits Brexit stance, as nearly eight out of 10 Labour-supporting students said they would be more likely to vote for a party that opposes leaving the EU.Younger voters\u0026nbsphelped to boost\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspin the polls during last year\u0027s snap election, leaving the Tories scrambling to improve their offer to young people.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Eloise Todd,\u0026nbspchief executive of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: The message is clear - young people want a people\u0027s vote on the final Brexit deal.

Mr Grewal is Sikh.Dennis Malloy and Judi Franco, who host a conservative-leaning talk show every day from 10am to 2pm on New Jersey 101.5 FM, will be off the air for 10 days, the station announced.We take these comments seriously and echo Dennis and Judi\u0027s sincere apology to Attorney General Grewal and his family, as well as the Sikh and Asian communities, Ron deCastro, the station\u0027s president, said in a statement posted on its website. Dennis and Judi are known for their plainspoken brand of humour, but in this case, the language used was clearly demeaning and inappropriate.Mr Grewal, a first-generation American who grew up in Essex, New Jersey, became the country\u0027s first Sikh state attorney general when he took office earlier this year. Mr Malloy and Ms Franco were discussing his recent order to suspend marijuana prosecutions in the state when Mr Malloy said he would never know Mr Grewal\u0027s name and would just call him the guy with the turban.Yeah, turban man, Mr Malloy said. And listen if that offends you, then don\u0027t wear the turban, man. I\u0027ll remember your name.The comments drew strong rebukes from Governor Phil Murphy, Senator Cory Booker and the state\u0027s ACLU chapter, which tweeted: Racism isn\u0027t cute. It\u0027s just racist.Outraged by the abhorrent and xenophobic comments mocking @NewJerseyOAG on The @DennisandJudi Show, Mr Murphy, a Democrat who appointed Mr Grewal, wrote on Twitter. Hate speech has no place in NJ, and does not belong on our airwaves.Mr Grewal responded as well.My name, for the record, is Gurbir Grewal, he wrote on Twitter. I\u0027m the 61st Attorney General of NJ. I\u0027m a Sikh American. I have 3 daughters. And yesterday, I told them to turn off the radio.Sikhs in the United States have been the target of slurs and hate crimes and are sometimes confused with Muslims. Men who follow the religion typically wear a beard and turban.Mr Grewal also shared a video from a speech he gave at the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies in which he talked about the ways racism had affected his political career.Scroll through any of the online comments about my work or my office or any news story, it can really be stomach turning, he said, noting that he\u0027d been receiving death threats since he became attorney general. I have been called a towel-head, a raghead, a terrorist.In an interview with the New York Times last year as he prepared to take office, he spoke about how he was harassed after September 11 by a stranger who would wait outside of his office and shout, I\u0027ve found him, I\u0027ve found bin Laden!Mr Malloy issued an apology to Mr Grewal and the East Asian community in New Jersey on Thursday afternoon.Speaking on behalf of Judi and myself today in offering our heartfelt apologies to the attorney general of the state of New Jersey, who is a man who certainly deserves more respect than our comments reflected on Wednesday, Mr Malloy said in a video apology. I made a mistake on Wednesday in saying something that was out of bounds and it was wrong.The station\u0027s parent company, Townsquare Media, declined to comment.Family of murdered Sikh man blames Trump policies for \u0027racial hatred\u0027Sikh community saves Fourth of July fireworks display with $10,000Racist Snapchat story targeting Sikh man on flight sparks outrage Sikhs ask for hate-crime probe after man told \u0027go back home\u0027NYPD to allow Sikh officers to wear turban on duty According to NorthJersey, the two hosts are known for their blunt talk on everyday issues with a conservative slant.

PPP placed third, with 43 seats.And while coalition talks for Mr Khan to form a government are just beginning, Mr Malani was willing to get a headstart on taking the victorious former sportsman – whose critics dub him “Taliban Khan” for his perceived closeness to extremist Islamist groups – to task.Standing up for minority rights represents one of the key tenets of the PPP manifesto, Mr Malani said, but he would not let his religion alone define his role in parliament.From cricketing legend to Pakistan PM, the rise of Imran KhanImran Khan’s supporters dance in the street as he declares victoryOnce a saviour, Imran Khan is just the least bad option in PakistanHere’s what we can expect of Pakistan’s likely new leader, Imran Khan“I am not only the representative of the Hindu or the minority,” he said. “In a general election the Muslim majority also votes for me, so I am going to perform my duty for all\u0026nbspmy people and for my nation. My agenda is to stand up for the rights of every citizen of Pakistan.”On the campaign trail, Mr Khan rallied support from mostly Muslims with populist messages calling for the death penalty for blasphemers and vitriol against neighbouring India.Most voters from religious minorities told The Independent on election day that they would vote for PML-N over Mr Khan’s PTI. Nadeem Masih, 30, from Islamabad’s small Christian community, said of Mr Khan: “He is not interested in our rights if I tell you the truth.”For Mr Malani, the biggest issue with Mr Khan was not necessarily his courting of extremists, but rather his courting of independent candidates who regularly swap parties for elections to join the highest bidder – a group of influential, veteran politicians dubbed “electables”.\u0026nbspPakistani security personnel gather at the site of a suicide attack near a polling station in QuettaA man who was injured in a suspected suicide bomb attack

He praised his campaign team of mostly Muslim workers and said he hoped soon other political parties would pick candidates like PPP “on merit, with no discrimination towards religion or any other basis”.And while he said he will “do what I can” as a member of the opposition to Mr Khan, his final words for the new prime minister elect were reconciliatory, adding: “Despite all the reservations, my best wishes are with him.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/27/10/california-wildfire-11.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906401  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 27 July 2018  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/27/10/california-wildfire-11.jpg","title":"lyudmila rudenko facts google doodle chess champion soviet age anniversary","story":"Created with Sketch.The first woman to be awarded the International Master title went on to save children in LeningradClick to followThe Independent OnlineLyudmila Rudenko: Five things you didn\u0027t know about the inspirational Soviet chess championLyudmila\u0026nbspRudenko, one of the world\u0027s most influential chess players,\u0026nbspwas born 114 years ago today.Born in\u0026nbsp1904 in the city of Lubny, then part of the Russian Empire and now in\u0026nbspcentral Ukraine, she would go on to win the highest honour in the game.\u0026nbspNow, Google has celebrated the chess master’s legacy with a Doodle which takes artistic inspiration from 1960’s graphic art and posters.Double world champion refuses to defend titles in Saudi ArabiaTwitter 280-character limit lets users play Tetris and Chess in tweetsHere are five facts about the chess supremo.\u0026nbsp1.

Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and on Monday, temperatures soared to their hottest in the whole year so far.A record-breaking 35C was recorded in Heathrow on Friday, July 27.Today (Saturday, July 28) temperatures are slightly cooler, as the Met Office predict the mercury will stay at a pleasant 18-19C.Forecaster Craig Snell said: “We are fairly certain the UK could see the hottest spell this year despite this heatwave having held its grip since June.“More warm air will move in from the continent by the end of the week making it highly likely we will at least have the hottest day this year.The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning and has predicted more isolated thunderstorms and spells of rain across the country.Tonight, therell be showers in the north, before the rain and wind passes down to the south.Next week: The weekend is set to be dry with sunny spells, but with some cloudier and windier conditions in the west and north-west, and some rain.Although there will be some fresher temperatures over the weekend, the hot conditions look set to return later on in the week.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 -

Hot temperatures are not uncommon in Britain during summer, but usually it is mixed in with cooler and wetter days as unsettled weather fronts move in from the Atlantic.This is because the jet stream - strong winds high in the sky from west to east - shift about. If it is north of the UK and Ireland then hot weather can result. If it moves down over the country, that means low pressure systems (wet and mild) are sucked our way. But this summer the jet stream has been jammed to the north of the UK and Ireland.This creates the conditions for high pressure to develop - and that means hot and dry weather.  It may be heading to the mid 30s for some - hotter than Jamaica or Miami -  but think yourselves lucky.In North Africa and the Middle East temperatures regularly exceed 50C in the summer. Overall though Sudan is the worst, with temperatures of more than 55C and very little rain a feature of life in a country horribly blighted by war and poverty.  On Friday 27 July, the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning.Across the UK there were isolated thunder storms, lightning and rain showers.Today, the rain has eased off and most areas of the UK will experience bright sunshine and dry weather.Later on, however, heavy, thundery rain is forecast across the northeast of Scotland and Northern Ireland.Temperatures have dropped slightly and its generally cooler today.The UK has been experiencing hot weather since April. But the current summer heatwave began on June 23.A month later it was still frazzling the south of England with grass becoming straw.Very hot weather is expected in the south throughout August. Elsewhere dry and above average temperatures are set to continue. But the Met Office predicts the north could be at risk from thunderstorms in the coming weeks.There are NO signs at present of the current weather pattern breaking."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000416246059.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dogs cats ice cubes heatwave hot","story":"We have the answer, plus all the information on the ailments your pet could suffer from during the heatwave and how to keep them fit, healthy and cool.They can – and it is recommended.There has been some discussion whether or not giving your dog ice on hot days can cause bloating in the animal, especially deep-chested large-breed dogs but there seems to be no evidence for this and the RSPCA recommends adding ice to their water bowl.Simply pop some in your pooch’s water bowl to help the water stay fresh and cool as the cubes will help lower the temperature.Some dogs also like popsicles and ice lollies, not the human varieties as those may contain artificial sweeteners and could be toxic to our four-legged friends.Try making some frozen bars just with water and some beef or chicken stock.Cats too can benefit from ice cubes in their water bowls.Research carried out by Pets at Home and Petplan insurance discovered the top 10 summer complaints your pet can suffer from - with upset stomachs, overheating and dehydration all making the list.The RSPCA has some great advice for looking after your pet during the heatwave to avoid problems.If you take your dog for a walk when it’s hot, it is best to avoid the hottest parts of the day and will reduce the chances of burning their paws on the pavement or suffer from heatstroke.Make sure cats and small animals have access to water and shaded areas.Tanks for fish, amphibians and reptiles should be kept out of direct sunlight, with regular water changes.Indoor birds and aviaries should have some shade.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh, let me count the ways. And believe me, it goes waaaay past ten.In fact, there are so many I feel it easier to group them together under various categories. So here goes.Eat with their mouths open stop an interesting group conversation to tell a dull, long-winded story with no point to it are overweight but claim they barely eat anything are thin but claim they eat everything pepper every, like, sentence with, like, the word “like” (Exhibit A: Anyone on Love Island) noisily slurp drinks in the cinema don’t pick up their dog’s poo make every sentence sound like a question litter the countryside don’t control their children in public places barge on to a train while you’re trying to get off read over your shoulder put bags on seats park in disabled bays when they’re clearly not live in a trillion quid mansion but claim to be socialist are glued to their mobile phone while their kid hurtles towards a road junction on its micro scooterupload ALL their holiday photos on social media, even the really crap ones say “aaah” loudly after drinking something.Aaaaaargh!Passengers who applaud when a flight lands parents who allow their kids to continually kick the back of your seat for the duration of a flight airport/rail managers who fail to boost staff numbers at peak times of the year oncoming drivers who push their way down a narrow road when you’re already three­quarters of the way along it train passengers who talk loudly on a mobile phone or think everyone else wants to listen to their ghastly music too people who cough on a crowded Tube/train without covering their mouth tailgaters drivers who don’t say thank you when you let them in middle lane hoggers packing hand luggage for a quick exit and being forced to put it in the hold.Head lice (so pointless) “Smart” TVs that make you feel anything but when trying to use the damned things novelty ringtones printed signs with spelling errors (use a pigging dictionary)online sites that won’t accept your usual password because it doesn’t have 48 squillion characters in it packaging that Harry Houdini would struggle to open roadworks with no one working on them spam emails automated phone systems immovable price stickers.Passing waiters who, when you ask for something simple like a spoon, reply: “Hang on, I’ll just get your waiter for you” shop assistants who stalk you around the rails as if you’re about to nick something fellow shoppers who start turning the rack of cards while you’re still looking at it hairdressers who chat incessantly through the supposedly “relaxing” head massage bit waiters who automatically hand the bill to the man queue-pushers at the bar bags “for life” that break the second you leave the supermarket assistants who carry on their social chat while you stand at the till waiting to be served cashiers who comment, “Ooh, are you having a party?”when you’re buying your own weekly wine supply shoppers who abuse the “ten items or less” aisle. Unless it’s me, of course.Believe me, I’m just scratching the surface here.Send me your irritations and I’ll print the best next week.Meghan Markles unpleasant half-sister Samantha is at it again – this time berating her understandably estranged royal relative for paying tribute to Nelson Mandela.“How about you pay tribute to your own father?” she ranted. “Enough is enough.Act like a humanitarian, act like a woman.If our father dies, I’m holding you responsible, Meg.”What a Grade A nasty.Meanwhile, last week Meghan’s father Thomas spent his 74th birthday picking up a Happy Meal from fast-food joint McDonald’s.Which, considering he’s just had heart stents fitted to help clear clogged arteries, suggests that if he dies any time soon, the only person responsible would be him.High-end designer ­Burberry junks £28million of unwanted products each year.A Burberry source has denied claims that they don’t donate it to charity because they don’t want the “wrong people” ­wearing it, saying that the destruction is actually to ­protect the brand against counterfeiting. Hmmm.The fakes ­market will always ­flourish irrespective of how many originals are pulped.So why doesn’t ­Burberry donate the items to upmarket charity ­auctions where people can bid a lot of money for something they might have bought anyway and have the extra thrill of knowing their cash will go to a deserving cause?Model David Gandy says he was once chucked out of a Hugo Boss catwalk show “because I couldn’t fit any of the clothing”.But luckily for the legion of Mr Gandy’s female fans, he can clearly still squeeze his, ahem, lardy self in to a teeny tiny pair of ­Y-fronts.Nope, still not going to wear them.Former Olympic showjumper Lizzie Purbrick has been telling her side of the story after being convicted of criminal damage for spraying her former lover’s home with several litres of pig’s blood.As you do.Lizzie, 63, says that initially, her relationship with Tory peer Lord Prior was “bloody marvellous” after they “met at a dinner party in Norfolk – the hotbed of sex – and I moved in with him four days later.”Whoa. Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine. I’ve been let out for a cigarette but I’m very bored.”We’ll take that as a no, then.Activity badges for Guides, Rangers and Brownies have been revamped for the 21st Century.You’ll be relieved to know Moped Mugging isn’t one of them, but there’s “Mixology” which involves designing a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails, “Festival Goer”, Vlogging, Mindfulness, Human Rights, Conscious ­Consumer and Media Critic (everyone’s a bloody critic.) Cripes.During my brief time as a Brownie in the late Sixties, I only achieved the “Hostess” badge, which entailed making a cup of tea for some visiting dignitaries at our local community centre and helping an elderly woman across the road.She didn’t want to go but, hey, a badge is a badge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what sort of relationship do they want with us after all this is over?Talking about, and planning for, no-deal is not the “bravado” sneered at by Simon Coveney, deputy to pipsqueak PM Leo Varadkar. It is a vital precaution we should have begun two years ago.Leavers do not fear it, despite the panic Remainers are now deliberately stoking.Nor is it a bluff. It simply looks more likely every day. Especially on days when Irish politicians are wheeled on to pressurise us to shift even further towards Brussels’ fixed position.We have compromised far too much already. The EU must now cross some red lines. Why not? No country has left before. The situation is unprecedented. The EU’s response must be too.Ireland will be hit hard if no deal is struck.It should be pleading with Brussels. It can see Theresa May has no ­further room for manoeuvre without her Government imploding.And no, Mr Coveney, Britain doesn’t need “more time”.We need the EU to finally accept we aren’t changing our minds — unlike ­Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty and despite the Remainer clamour to do so.That way lies permanent servitude, global humiliation and political chaos.HOW can anyone guarantee a convicted paedophile or rapist is safe enough to be taken off the sex offenders’ register?The number of criminals winning that right since a law change six years ago is 1,230, including 632 child abusers.They no longer report to police or tell them if they are away from home.Even some put on the database “for life” can apply after 15 years to be removed. A thriving legal industry helps them do it.Decisions are simply at cops’ discretion. But how stringent are their tests when approval rates vary so wildly?We know “life” sentences in prison mean nothing. Now we cannot even trust “life on the sex offenders’ register”.Public safety must always come before the rights of potentially dangerous perverts.SOMETIMES we despair at our cops.They couldn’t be bothered looking into shoplifting at John Keppie’s sweet store. But they snapped into action with a warning over “data protection” when he put up CCTV pictures of the suspects.What is he meant to do?

They are likely to dip even further tomorrow to 71F (22C).The heatwave will return next week with at least 86F (30C).And experts believe heatwaves will become more frequent because of climate change.Dr Friederike Otto, of the University of Oxford, said: “What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace — in some cases, it already has.“So this is something that society can and should prepare for.”THOUSANDS of holidaymakers endured a second day of chaos on the Eurotunnel yesterday after tickets were cancelled.Passengers were left in limbo after the cross-Channel rail operator tore up bookings amid delays caused by faulty air conditioning units.They were blocked from travelling if they were due to return the same day or today.It comes after thousands of passengers sweltered in 6½-hour queues on Thursday as trains were pulled from service."},{"url":null,"title":"moment pet lover is sworn at as she confronts two women for leaving dog in car with open window on hottest day of the year","story":"Elaine Woolacott was at Stone Lane Retail Park in Exeter on Thursday evening when she discovered a dog panting in the back of a motor.She whipped out her phone and began filming the parched pooched who came over and licked her hand through the open window.Elaine kept filming until the dog’s owners returned to the vehicle while she and another shopper were reporting the dog being trapped in the car to the authorities.The owners became abusive, branding her a “d***head”, before angrily driving off.The footage of the dog in the car and the subsequent confrontation with its owner has gone viral with almost 200,000 views on Facebook.Elaine told DevonLive: As soon as I got out of my car I saw the puppy.It was such a hot day again and the dog looked in real discomfort.It was absolutely burning and the dog hadnt been given any water.The driver of the car said that they had only been in the shop for one minute but I had been filming for at least eight minutes by then.Im so angry that someone would treat their dog like this.Earlier this week Elaine confronted a couple after waiting for over 10 minutes for them to return to the vehicle with their young child.She recorded the dog and the ensuing argument on her phone, later uploading it to Facebook where it has received over 114,000 views.Elain added: I received over 1,000 private messages yesterday.”People said I should have smashed the windows but I have health problems which mean I cant do that.I just hope the RSPCA take action again."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000342437527.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prudential ride london 2018 road closures routes map dates","story":"Here’s the lowdown on what’s happening and what roads and routes to avoid.Prudential Ride London is seen as the world’s greatest festival of cycling.This year’s event – the sixth of its kind – takes place on the weekend of July 28 and 29.More than 100,000 professional and amateur riders are expected to take part across seven separate events across the capital.Dozens of roads are set to be closed in central London on Saturday July 28 and across most of London and Surrey on Sunday July 29.The event is split into seven events over two days.

And they hope the message will make EU leaders more likely to compromise - but it is set to be controversial in both the UK and Ireland.Fresh from a roasting by Brussels, the PM yesterday met the leaders of Austria, Estonia and the Czech Republic in a bid sell her dented Brexit blueprint to fellow EU leaders.Ahead of her summer break in Italy Mrs May, was hosted by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at the Salzberg Festival and held talks there with the other leaders on the fringes of the opera gathering.Both the Austrian and Czech governments have been critical of aspects of EU policy, particularly on migration, and Mrs May is determined to exploit internal divisions within the EU to push for a more flexible approach from Brussels.But in a blow last night Czech Europe Minister Ales Chmelar insisted there was unity behind Michel Barniers approach to the talks.The EU chief negotiator Mr Barnier all but rejected a key plank of her Brexit strategy on Thursday.Central to the PM’s plan is her facilitated customs arrangement under which tariffs charged at the border would be passed on to either the Britain or the EU depending on the destination of imported goods, but Mr Barnier made clear that was not acceptable to Brussels.And Mr Chmelar gave his backing to Mr Barniers position, saying: There is a clear problem with the fact that the EU will not have a mechanism to control its borders and it would be delegated - without any EU control - to a third country, which would be Britain after March.The fact that we are maybe critical of some aspects of EU policies, be it in migration or be it in other areas, does not meant that we wouldnt stand behind a very strong position on the integrity of the single market.”Sebastian Kurz was slightly warmed to Mrs May on her arrival in Salzburg, but also backed the Brussels hardliner.He said: “I think that the negotiations are going quite well” but stressed the importance of “avoiding a hard Brexit”.He added: “We will support Michel Barnier and also you and this way.”Last night Henry Newman of the think tank Open Britain warned Brussels was making the same mistakes that led to Brexit: “Member states need to give the British decision to leave a little more sober reflection – perhaps when David Cameron came asking for flexibility during his renegotiation it might have been better to give a little more.He added: “They need to look beyond the details of customs arrangements and participation in this or that agency, important though they are, to the bigger canvas: the future shape of this continent.”After all, Theresa May sold it to the country terribly.Predictably, the EU slapped down our offer. They will not allow Britain to enjoy frictionless trade as a non- member. So what happens next?EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier wants us to stay in the customs union, ending our freedom to strike global trade deals. But Mrs May would not survive breaching her own red line on this.Going back on her word would spark more Brexit ministers resigning from Government, making her position untenable. So what then?If Barnier and the sozzled Jean-Claude Juncker don’t like our proposal and insist on continuing to punish us then they leave us with no choice.No-deal is the only logical next step.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insists that we will be prepared for Brexit “come what may”. Good.We don’t want a hard border in Ireland. Nor do the Irish. But if the EU won’t budge, it may be unavoidable.Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s cosying up to Brussels and his anti-Brexit sabre- rattling is grossly misplaced.His country will be hit badly in the event of a no-deal.Let’s see how the Irish like that.EU leaders are due to meet in Salzburg on September 20 for an informal summit that could be used to discuss Brexit developments amid claims German Chancellor Angela Merkel believes there has been drift in the talks.NEARLY half of voters think Theresa May’s soft Brexit Chequers plan is a dud, a poll revealed.IPSOS Mori found fewer than one in three think the vision is a goer, and 47 per cent would not support it. And it showed confidence in Mrs May’s government had plummeted since the walkout of Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson.Mrs May’s satisfaction ratings among Tory voters also slumped from 68 per cent to 50 per cent, according to the Evening Standard survey.Jeremy Corbyn’s approval ratings fell from 31 per cent last month to 28 per cent.

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The beleaguered Prime Minister’s blueprint for quitting the EU had already been rubbished by Brussels and now the UK public have dealt a fresh blow to her waning authority. Just 30% of adults are satisfied with her performance - a five-point fall compared with a month ago, a survey revealed. The new score is the lowest net satisfaction score of her Premiership of -32, according to the Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard.  Nearly half of those polled believed the Chequers deal will be bad for Britain, with just 29% expecting it to be good. Her ratings among Conservatives dropped from 68% to 55% as the public digested the proposal, which triggered the resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Amid mounting pressure, Mrs May tonight held talks with Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz in Salzburg. Backing EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Kurz called for the sides to find ways to avoid a “hard Brexit” and strike a deal. But the PM, who lost two senior Cabinet ministers in the aftermath of the Chequers agreement, is battling to keep control of her top team. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox sounded the latest warning as he said extending Brexit negotiations would be a “complete betrayal” of Leave voters.  Keeping the UK in the EU beyond March 2019 could offer extra time to unlock stalled talks. But Dr Fox told Business Insider: “To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right.” Former Brexit Minister Steve Baker claimed the EU was pushing Britain towards a choice between leaving without a deal or “capitulation”. He said: “Chequers was bound to be the beginning of the EU pushing the UK to the unacceptable combination of EEA (European Economic Area) and customs union membership. “On this road, eventually we will reach a fork between final capitulation or exit with no agreement.”   Meanwhile, supermarket chiefs ridiculed a call by new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab that they should stockpile food in the event of a no-deal scenario.  One executive told the Financial Times: “It’s ridiculous. It’s scary because it shows how far the Government is from the reality of how things work. It’s genuinely worrying.” The British Retail Consortium said: “Stockpiling of food is not a practical response to a no-deal on Brexit, and industry has not been approached by government to begin planning for this.

A combination of austerity and incompetence has left the prison and probation services on their knees and the latest statistics should be a matter of national shame. Assaults on prison officers are at a record high, more than 15,000 mobile phones were found in England’s jails and drug abuse is rife. One in 10 prisons is now rated “a serious concern.”  If this were not bad enough, the Government is having to spend millions bailing out the privatised probation service. None of this should come as a surprise.

Chantelle Murphy, 26, tried hair removal cream for the first time but it burned the skin on her face. Her friends have been jokingly comparing her to the men in the 118 118 advert and Looney Tunes\u0027 Yosemite Sam because she was left with a red moustache shaped mark. Chantelle had spotted the Nair Moisturising Hair Removal Cream for the bargain price of 99p. Thinking it would be a time saver, the mum-of-two smothered the hair remover cream on her face on Sunday evening and waited for it to work. But when the cream started burning her lip, Chantelle quickly scrubbed it off. She was mortified to see it had left her with an embarrassing burn the shape of a handlebar moustache above her lips. Despite struggling to cover the burn with make-up to go to work, Chantelle was able to see the funny side. And after sending a picture to pals, she was told she should get a razor next time.  Chantelle, from Bridgend, South Wales, said: It had to happen to me. Basically I\u0027d never, ever tried any hair removal cream before. I just thought, oh, you know what, I\u0027ll give it a go. After two, three minutes at most I just felt it getting really warm. I thought maybe this is normal because when you dye your hair sometimes you can feel the heat on your skin. After another 30 seconds I thought I need to get it off. As I was wiping it off you could see the red appearing and it was getting worse and worse. I\u0027ve got quite a professional job and I didn\u0027t really want to go in looking like that. My friends thought it looked like the 118 guys. It was obvious what I had tried to do as well. It wasn\u0027t just a little bit red, it was full on the shape I\u0027d applied it to. Above my mouth was red. They were saying oh, try gillette next time. Somebody said it looked like Yosemite Sam. It\u0027s quite lighthearted and funny. I wasn\u0027t too upset. I was just thinking \u0027this had to happen to me, didn\u0027t it?\u0027 and wondered how I was going to go to work tomorrow.  Luckily Chantelle, who works as an independent living officer, was able to soothe the burn enough to disguise it with makeup the next day. But the mum claims she\u0027ll never use facial hair removal cream again. Chantelle said: I would absolutely not use face hair removal cream after this. I think I will just stick to waxing from now on. It\u0027s such a private thing to do, hair removal cream on your upper lip, and it\u0027s backfired. I tried loads of aloe vera stuff but when I woke up on Monday morning it was still quite red, but it was enough for me to cover to go to work. But because it was stinging on my face it was burning as I was applying makeup.  She added: It has pretty much gone now but it is a bit itchy where the skin is peeling around it. While the skin is healing I\u0027ve had to avoid wearing fake tan. It was the first time I\u0027d ever applied it before. I just wish I\u0027d applied it to my legs first because if I\u0027d had that sort of reaction on my legs I\u0027d have been like \u0027woah, no more now\u0027 and I could have hidden it.

Locals have even started breeding their donkeys with stronger mules so it is easier for them to carry fatter tourists. The animals have traditionally been used to carry visitors up the hundreds of cobbled steps and steep hills on the popular cruise ship stop-off. But campaigners claim they are being forced to carry ever-heavier loads, causing spinal injuries and open wounds from ill-fitting saddles.  A spokesman for charity Help the Santorini Donkeys said: “They’re having to resort to using cross-bred mules, as the donkeys just aren’t strong enough. “It’s recommended animals carry no more than 20% of their body weight. “Obese and overweight tourists com\u0026shy\u0026shybined with the lack of shade and water, heat and cobbled steps is what’s causing such a problem.” He added: “There should be a weight restriction. With donkeys it should be no more than eight stone, but how would that be imposed?”  In summer, up to five cruise ships a day bring swarms of 1,200 tourists. Witnesses claim donkeys make four to five journeys up the 500-plus steps to capital Fira town. Santorini Animal Welfare Association founder Christina Kaloudi, 42, moved to the island from Athens 10 years ago.

The couple, from Hull, booked him to tile their bathroom but he left the job unfinished and the property in a complete mess, with rubbish piled in every room. But they say the man still wants to be paid in full - and has taken their house keys for ransom until they do so. The houseowner and mum-of-one, aged 24, who asked not to be named, booked the tradesman online. We asked around for recommendations but nobody knew of anyone who could do the work, she told Hull Live .  We found a guy that said he could do the work at a decent price, so we agreed to take him on. The first night on the Monday we checked into the house to see how he was getting on, as we aren\u0027t living in it at the moment until it is all done up, and it all looked fine. We didn\u0027t have time to call in on Tuesday, but on the Wednesday when the work was meant to be finished, we walked in to an absolute bomb site. She says the tiler left a mess in nearly every room of the house, and thinks what he has done in the home is completely disrespectful. Grout was all up the walls, the tiles were wonky, the mosaic doesn\u0027t go all the way up the ceiling and the floor tiles are ruined, she said. We\u0027re also going to need a new bath as he let grout fall in there and took the protective peel off it, and now all the grout has hardened and scratched it. He trashed the bedroom that will be my son\u0027s by leaving all the rubbish in there and he left the kitchen in a state with grout splattered all up the walls where he mixed it for the tiles - why he didn\u0027t go outside to mix it I just can\u0027t understand. He also left mucky hand prints on the fridge and had unplugged it after helping himself to all our drinks. The carpets in the rooms were also left a mess where he had walked about and left tile cuttings.  The tiler still quoted \u0026pound360 for the work, but the homeowners say they are not paying it and estimate it may now cost another \u0026pound500 to put right his work and replace items he ruined. We offered him \u0026pound100 for the work so that he would give us his house keys back, which we though was a fair contribution, but he\u0027s demanded more money off us and has said the bathroom has been left like it is because the walls are poor. His wife has called us screaming down the phone to demand money from us, and he\u0027s emotionally blackmailed us by saying his daughter is giving him money from her piggy bank as we aren\u0027t paying him. We just can\u0027t afford it, though, when we are going to have to pay out so much to fix what he\u0027s done. The couple say the situation has taken its toll and they are now worried about employing another tiler. My partner is absolutely livid about it all and I\u0027m really annoyed, she said.

A study of 750 students aged 16 and over found seven in 10 think the cost of higher education at home is ‘too high.’ And three in five are concerned Brexit could increase the cost of UK tuition fees even more. Amid this, the poll commissioned by foreign exchange specialists, Caxton, found four in 10 believe studying overseas is likely to lead to a higher paid job upon graduation. In comparison, just 14 per cent are confident studying in the UK would set them up for financial success in the future.  Edward Gott, head of premier clients at Caxton, said: “It’s clear that an education overseas can offer a wealth of benefits, bringing financial rewards as well as opportunities for significant cultural enrichment. “Although it might at first appear a daunting investment proposition, Brits can in fact save thousands of pounds by looking overseas to further their studies and reap the rewards as a result.” The research found the USA is the most popular choice for those who would like to study abroad, followed by Spain and Germany. But exchange rates would play a part in deciding which country to study in for 54 per cent, with one fifth more inclined to move abroad if foreign exchange rates were more beneficial towards the pound.  Researchers also polled 1,000 parents and found more than half would support their children should they decide to study abroad. Almost half believe it would enable their kids to have ‘new and exciting experiences’, while 45 per cent think it would provide them with important life skills. Despite this, 44 per cent of mums and dads admit they would be worried about financing their child’s studies overseas.

It\u0027s actually the most likely time of the year that your vehicle will run into problems. But the good news is there\u0027s plenty you can do to prevent a problem before it occurs. Below we\u0027ve pulled together everything you need to know to try and get around some of the most common issues, from where not to drive to what you need to check today.  We already know that summer can cause problems with your car battery , sapping it of essential fluids and running performance into the ground.   But you can get that checked with a Halfords Car Battery Fitting Service where in-store experts can fit a new one if necessary, with prices for a Halfords Car Battery starting at \u0026pound58.   When am I most likely to break down?    Department for Transport figures have revealed that in 2016, August was the peak month for breakdown incidents, with 17,777 cars needing the help of a breakdown service.  In the years, 2014 and 2015, July was the peak month, with 20,129 and 18,588 incidents recorded. The figures also reveal that Friday is the day most cars end up on the hard shoulder of England\u0027s motorways. And while the month varies across years, Friday was a constant in being the day most likely for cars to breakdown.  Which road is a breakdown blackspot?  The M1 is the undisputed leader in breakdowns. Between 2014 and 2016 there were 78,672 reported incidents. The M25 was a close second (71,933 breakdowns) and the M6 third (71,134 incidents).   One way that you can avoid additional stress on your engine (not to mention delays), is by avoiding heavy traffic. Using a sat nav like the Garmin Drive 51LMT-S with UK and Ireland Maps 5 Sat Nav - now \u0026pound88 (save \u0026pound31.99) is a great way to prevent hitting jams as it offers alerts when there are delays on your route.   Pair it with a dashcam to film everything that happens in front of you on the road - such as the Nextbase Dashcam 412GW , now \u0026pound103 (save \u0026pound26). You might find this gives you additional piece of mind. The device boasts QUAD HD 1440p High Definition recording at 30 frames per second to capture a 140\u0026deg viewing angle to capture the entire road ahead. This helps to provide you with instant evidence to support insurance claims in helping prove an accident was not your fault.   How to prevent a breakdown   A modern car is a marvel of engineering. For the most part you can be sure it will give you years of reliable service. However, your tyres, battery and engine oil levels should also be regularly checked. In the summer, engine oil gets hotter, making it less viscous. This can put a strain on the components in your engine and could lead to a serious problem.  Not having the right level of oil in your car will make this worse, so check regularly and top up with a good quality oil. Pop into a local Halfords store (no appointment needed), and trained experts will check your engine oil levels and top it up if needed. They can also advise on the best engine oil for your car.   Not everyone has the time to get under the bonnet, so a Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

Gweneth Lee, 46, jetted off for a weekend in Paris in which she and her mystery man stayed at a \u0026pound15,000-a-night hotel, dined in a three-star Michelin restaurant and went on a \u0026pound17,000 shopping spree. The date culminated in the widow taking part in a \u0026pound10,000 Fifty Shades of Grey themed erotic photoshoot alongside the city\u0027s most famous landmarks including the Pont Alexandre III bridge and the Eiffel Tower.   Hotel guest BITES bridegroom after claiming someone from wedding was romping with his girlfriend behind door  Businesswoman Ms Lee, of Chelsea, West London said: My lover is like a real-life Christian Grey with a string of businesses ranging from tech to property. But he is real interest is sex and the kind of kinky games that Christian enjoys in the Fifty Shades of Grey books and films. He loves erotic imagery and it was his idea to hire one of Paris\u0027s finest erotic photographers for the shoot. We went from landmark to landmark and my lover choreographed all the shots.   Charles Bronson\u0027s wife says she\u0027s eating humble pie about divorce after notorious inmate releases statement  My favourite is the one next to the famous Pont Alexandre III bridge that crosses the Seine connecting the Champs-Elysees with the Eiffel Tower. It is one of the most romantic locations in the world but also highly erotic. We went straight back to the Ritz afterwards and made love while we chose the most smouldering shots for the shoot. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life.  Ms Lee has been dubbed Britain\u0027s most prolific mistress after dating at least 100 married men who treat her to expensive holidays all over the world. She got a taste for the high-life when she was married to her late oil executive husband Robert, who died from cancer ten years ago.  They were both having affairs on IllicitEncounters - a dating website for married people - and she simply carried on using the same site to meet more lovers after his death.  She says she prefers dating married men because they are wealthy and they just want no-strings fun and sex. During her weekend away in Paris, she was taken to the city by private jet and stayed in the \u0026pound15,000-a-night Imperial Suite at the Ritz Hotel. The couple dined at the three-Michelin starred Arpege restaurant where their dinner for two was \u0026pound4,000 due to the champagne they consumed. Other treats in the Paris weekend included a \u0026pound10,000 shopping trip to the Dior boutique in Avenue Montaigne and \u0026pound3,000-worth of erotic lingerie from the Carine Gilson boutique in Rue de Grenelle.  Ms Lee added: The trip to Paris was \u0027Christian\u0027s\u0027 little to treat for me to celebrate five years of dating. He lives in London and has a fairly detached relationship from his wife who is busy bringing up their two teenage children and doesn\u0027t share her husband\u0027s love of the kinky stuff. She is French and accepts that he will have affairs as long as they don\u0027t interfere with family life and I am one of several women he sees. I know one of his other lovers, a beautiful PA in her late 20s, because our dates overlapped once and he introduced us. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life. It was a weekend I will never forget where no expense was spared to ensure we had the time of our lives. The highlight was the unforgettable photoshoot in many of the most famous locations in Paris shot by Santillo, who specialises in the finest erotic photography. The only way we were able to do it was getting up at dawn so we got the very best light and could shoot without being swamped by tourists and over-inquisitive gendarmes.  Miss Lee and her lover travelled to the \u0027date\u0027 on his private jet. She said: People boast about turning only want to \u0027turn left\u0027 when they fly, meaning walking to the first class seats. But that is nothing compared to a travelling by private jet. My lover goes everywhere on his, even taking his beloved black labrador dog with him. Thankfully the dog skipped the trip to Paris but he\u0027s flown with us on other trips.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s romantic story has enchanted the masses, with people following every development in their relationship.  But the former Suits star isn\u0027t the first American to charm a member of our royal family. Baltimore-raised Wallis Simpson met Edward, Prince of Wales when she was 34 - the same age Meghan was when she met Harry. And the similarities between the two women don\u0027t end there.  Wallis, like Meghan, had already been married before meeting her prince. This caused controversy for Edward - who went on to become King Edward VIII - as royals were not allowed to marry divorcees at this time. Eventually he opted to abdicate his throne, so he could marry the love of his life. Subsequently, Wallis became a duchess - the Duchess of Windsor.  The two duchesses can also be seen to share similar tastes when it comes to their style. It is reported that Wallis\u0027 favourite designer was Hubert de Givenchy, the same fashion house which Meghan selected to design her wedding dress. Meghan\u0027s wardrobe also appears to be reflecting some of Wallis\u0027 style choices, with both preferring muted tones, stepping out in shades of beige, navy and taupe.  A close look at photos of the two will reveal that Meghan also often wears her hair in a middle parting - just as Wallis did. If that weren\u0027t enough, the car in which the Duchess of Sussex was driven to her wedding in, is believed to be the same model which took Wallis to the funeral of her husband over 40 years ago. However there is one big difference between the two women.

Web designer Jack Shepherd was convicted of manslaughter but is now subject to an international manhunt after absconding shortly before his trial. Jack Shepherd, 30, was sentenced in his absence at London\u0027s Old Bailey for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown, 24, by gross negligence of the incident in 2015. It was revealed in court that the missing man became married a short time after Ms Brown\u0027s death and now has a two-year-old child, according to his barrister.  However, the relationship broke down and Jack struggled to find work because of his drinking and his links to the case. Shepherd’s barrister Stephen Vullo QC blamed his failure to appear on \u0027cowardice\u0027. “It’s cowardice. It is not some clever trick to avoid justice,” he said. “He could not have faced the Brown family from the dock and it’s cowardice he could not do so.” He was still in hiding for Thursday\u0027s sentencing - despite the victim\u0027s family pleading with him to return and face the consequences of his actions. Shepherd had been trying to impress Charlotte after meeting her on the dating website OkCupid, the court had heard. .  He regularly used his small red speedboat to “pull women” even though it lacked basic safety features and was an accident waiting to happen. Katie Brown, the victim\u0027s sister, said in a statement on behalf of the family: The immense pain and anguish we feel will never pass and our grief will last a lifetime. She continued: Charlie died because she thought she would be safe taking a journey on Jack Shepherd\u0027s speedboat - a speedboat that we know was unsafe and that he bought with the sole purpose of seducing young women and one he had used recklessly many times before. During the trial, in his absence, with his whereabouts unknown to both the court and police, Jack Shepherd was afforded more rights that Charlie.

Something to do with the sun, \u0026shyapparently. And how it refuses to go away, leaving us red, sweaty and worried about the dog. It’s given commentators a chance to contrast then and now, with some right-wingers declaring that life was much worse in those dark, pre-Thatcherite days when it took the GPO weeks to install a phone, inflation was 17% and unions held the country to ransom. Which is a load of Space Hopper-sized balls. As the New Economics Foundation concluded 14 years ago, 1976 was the best year on record for equality of incomes and quality of life. We had a sense of community and \u0026shyfairness back then. We invested in public services so you could get seen quickly at hospitals and borrow books from libraries, there were untouched parks and school playing fields and councils filled in potholes. University education was free, with maintenance grants paid to poorer kids, houses were affordable for first-time buyers, and most families could get a council home to rent. People worked fewer hours in more secure jobs and were offered decent pensions.  There was Taxi Driver on at the pictures, Rising Damp on the telly, every kind of music from Abba to The Sex Pistols and it cost as little as 70p to watch the best football teams. I’m not saying everything was hunky-dory. Homophobia, racism, sexism and police corruption went unchecked, and due to under-investment, poor industrial relations and the after-effects of the global oil crisis, the economy was slumping. But compared with today, 1976 seems like a long holiday spent in a hot tub with Charlie’s Angels. In 2018, we are a bitterly divided nation with a directionless government talking about stockpiling food and \u0026shymedicines in case a no-deal Brexit pushes us off a cliff. A Resolution Foundation report has just warned that eight million “just about managing” families are no better off today than in 2003 due to income stagnation marking the largest rise in poverty since Thatcher’s era. We work longer hours in far less secure jobs, the NHS is in crisis, there are hordes of homeless on the streets, childhood obesity and diabetes are at epidemic levels, students are smothered in debt, the young can’t afford to leave their parents and underfunded police have given up chasing many criminals. Worst of all, greed at the top has gone off the scale and wealth disparities have never been more glaring. In 1976, the average British CEO earned 20 times what his average employee did. Today the average FTSE chief executive earns almost 400 times more than a worker on the National Living Wage.

Ava Wilkinson, from Preston, Lancs, was playing on her slide on Monday afternoon when it toppled over on an uneven paving stone, sending her crashing to the ground. And Ava\u0027s mother, Laura Cook, 29, said she feared for her daughter\u0027s life after seeing pools of blood and a massive hole in her forehead that left the toddler\u0027s skull exposed. Stay-at-home mum-of-two Laura said: Ava\u0027s dad, Darren, was cutting the grass and had moved all the toys, including the slide, onto the patio.  There were some uneven paving slabs on patio and when Ava got onto the slide it toppled over and she smashed her head on the stones. I just heard this almighty scream. Darren reached her first and there was blood everywhere. He was crying his eyes out and I started to panic but I didn\u0027t want to get upset in front of Ava. It all happened at once and I didn\u0027t know what to do. You could see her skull through the hole in her head and I knew it was bad. We wrapped a tea towel around her head to try and stop the blood but she started getting drowsy. I tried to keep her awake because I knew if she lost consciousness then it would be difficult to wake her up. My worst fear was that her skull had cracked and the hole had gone deeper, affecting her brain.  Ava\u0027s dad, Darren Wilkinson, 40, a furniture up-cycler, immediately phoned an ambulance and within 15 minutes paramedics arrived at their Preston home to assess the little girl\u0027s injury. Deciding that the hole was too big to treat at the scene, paramedics called the North West Air Ambulance Service to take Ava to Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool, some 40 miles away. Laura said that if it wasn\u0027t for the quick responses of NHS Ambulance staff, her daughter could\u0027ve been left with a fractured skull, brain damage, or worse. Doctors took Ava in for surgery the following morning, where she was given general anaesthetic so they could operate.  Luckily, the wound only required stitches but staff at the Liverpool hospital said the two year old would be left with a huge scar which may need cosmetic surgery later down the line. Ava was allowed to go home on Tuesday afternoon and Laura said her daughter is now on the mend. The mum said: The staff in the helicopter were brilliant they kept Ava awake all the way to the hospital by playing with her and letting her mess around with their visors in order to distract her from the pain. And when we got to Alder Hey there were a team of nurses and doctors waiting for us they rushed Ava into the emergency room straight away.

Another passenger Louise Waler blasted Stansted as \u0027utter chaos\u0027 due to queues to get into airport terminal and planes being sent to the wrong stands.  She said on Twitter: Have just been de-boarded when they realised it wasn\u0027t our plane.  Even staff calling it the worst they\u0027ve ever seen and Stansted doesn\u0027t deserve to be in operation.    police    Commuters are also frustrated with the lack of communication from Stansted staff compared to European airports. Colin McCash posted online: So it takes a fellow passenger to get in contact with Swissport who advise that our flight from Glasgow is 6th in line to unload at half hour each.  Prospect of another three hours waiting for our bags. Where are the Stansted staff keeping us advised? Be ashamed Stansted airport.         Donella Bonney raged about being kept on a plane on the runway in the heat for over four and a half hours with no offer of refreshment, explanation or alternative. There are also reports of tearful children being forced to simply head back home instead of going on holiday as passengers are unable to get anywhere near the departure gates. The London based terminal however was unable to confirm on how much longer the delays would last and advised passengers to contact their airline directly. Problems appear to be still in place at Gatwick Airport which tweeted this morning that adverse weather may result in delays and cancellations.  Holidaymakers expressed their frustration on social media after flightpaths were affected by the weather, affecting a number of airlines including easyJet and Ryanair. UK air traffic controllers were expecting to see the busiest day of the summer yesterday as hundreds of thousands of Brits take to the skies on their summer holidays.   Nats, the UK air traffic control service, had been due to handle 8,841 flights in 24 hours. People facing difficulties have been urged to contact their airlines. A spokesman for Stansted Airport told : Air traffic control have put restrictions in place due to the storms. It affects everyone.

People all around the UK have been eagerly waiting in vain to see the stunning lunar eclipse. It has been sighted this evening in locations all around the world including in Kenya, Italy, Pakistan, Greece, Egypt and Israel. Beautiful photographs have been shared, with the bright and shining moon tinted a striking orange-red colour. But it was no-where to be seen in Britain. People had set up camp outdoors, in high spots towering over cities to get the best view - but clouds largely obscured the celestial phenomenon.  Social media users took to Twitter to vent their frustration. One said: Been clear skies for 2 months and now the clouds decide to come out + it’s raining.(sic) Another wrote: Aww com\u0027on rain \u0026amp cloud pls disappear so I can get some photographs of the night\u0027s blood moon and lunar eclipse.(sic). Others seemed angry about missing out.  One wrote: As usual the UK  weather f**** any chance of seeing a blood moon.  And another said: Can\u0027t see the Blood Moon in Manchester UK Tonight Thank you Mother F***ing Nature for The Clouds.(sic)           But it wasn\u0027t bad news for everyone. In Nairobi, Kenyans watched as the moon darkened. This is what life is all about: Magical moments like this, said Teddy Muthusi as he watched from Uhuru Park in Nairobi. It\u0027s just beautiful. It\u0027s well worth it. On the banks of India\u0027s Ganges, temples were closed ahead of eclipse. In Singapore, enthusiasts watched through telescopes at the Marina South Pier.  Hundreds of people in Australia paid to watch the eclipse from the Sydney Observatory before sunrise. When the moon moved into the conical shadow of the earth, it went from being illuminated by the sun to being dark. Some light, though, still reaches it because it is bent by the earth\u0027s atmosphere. It\u0027s called a blood moon because the light from the sun goes through the earth\u0027s atmosphere on its way to the moon, and the earth\u0027s atmosphere turns it red in the same way that when the sun goes down it goes red, Andrew Fabian, professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge, told Reuters.

Chris Ingham, 34, is the beanie-wearing star of The Ingham Family, a YouTube channel that documents the amusing but chaotic life of his family alongside wife Sarah and his three young daughters Isabelle, Esme and Isla. Two teenage fans have now come forward with accusations that Mr Ingham sent them seedy texts on social media – including one 16-year-old who he asked to sneak out of her mum’s hotel room and meet him in the middle of the night Another claim contends that Ingham sent a leering message to a 19-year-old by requesting she send a nude photo after promising to make her a star.  Chris and the family have strenuously denied these claims and said they are “entirely without foundation.” 16-year-old Jess Simpson, from Sussex, discovered that she was staying at the same resort as Ingham while visiting Florida’s Disneyland Resort with her family last October. After contacting her idol to say they were staying at the same location, Jess was bombarded with inappropriate messages on Twitter from Chris Ingham.   In a detailed Twitter post, Jess revealed how he called her “mega-pretty” and told her “I bet I can make you feel a lot better about things”. He later asked if she wanted to go “skinny dipping” and said “If you can sneak out without waking anyone then deffo come meet me!” The two never met in person but Jess later told her mother who contacted police over the unwanted messages.   A Sussex Police statement to The Sun read :  The person who made contact with her was also believed to be a British man. The contacts were of a sexual nature, however they did not meet in person. As the girl was over 16, no offences have been committed. In another incident, 19-year-old Bella Fear, from Staffordshire, claims the YouTuber sent her unwanted messages after the pair met at Alton Towers where she was working. He told her she had a “banging bod” and promised that he could make her a star in the entertainment industry. One lurid private message from the YouTube star asked that she ‘drop her towel’ in a selfie.

Erika Chavolla was working at the Las Vegas store when she got into a dispute with 24-year-old Sabrinah Fontelar. Sabrinah had allegedly filled her water cup up with soda and when staff confronted her she threw her milkshake towards them and insulted Erika\u0027s mum. Dramatic footage of the fight shows Erika launch at the woman and repeatedly punch her in the face and back of the head after Sabrinah hit her with a tray.  Sabrinah, from Las Vegas, has since bragged on Instagram that she was the customer in the video. And Erika said yesterday that she has kept her job at McDonald\u0027s following the incident - although the company are yet to confirm this.

So when Colin was replacing the floor joists in the Plymouth home, he decided to have a little dig down to see what was going on and was amazed to discover a well. The couple had three young children at the time, so decided to cover it up so it was safer for them. But after Colin retired from his job in the civil service, he decided it was time to have another little look. He soon found the hole was a lot bigger than he first thought, and with the help of a friend has now managed to dig down 17ft.  He said: The hole was full of earth, but with the help of a neighbour, we have managed to get about 17ft deep. I always wanted to dig it out to see if I could find a pot of gold at the bottom, so when I retired that\u0027s what I did. I was quite surprised really, I would have preferred it to be in the garden where I could have got at it a little easier. Using a ladder and a bucket on a pulley system, it took them around six months to get to the depth it is at now.  Colin said: We think it\u0027s a bottle well. It\u0027s 30 inches wide now and could go down another 5-6ft. I thought I\u0027d found a sword around 4ft down - it was a wooden thing that must have had a leather sheath on it as you can see stitch holes. That\u0027s why I want to get to the bottom. Who knows what\u0027s down there. We have no idea when it was built. There could have been a couple of cottages here or it could have served a farm.

The strange five-inch long specimen resembles a sausage with a long thin tail and it has baffled social media users across the country. A fierce debate erupted online when Bex posted footage of the alien-like creature. The strange specimen is believed to be a larger than normal rat-tailed maggot, which will eventually turn into a drone fly.  The woman described it as moving like a worm but much larger in size, with a long, thin tail but without a face or legs. Her friends were quick to offer their insight into what they believe the creature could be. One said: That thing is absolutely gross! I\u0027ve never seen something so disgusting! OMG get rid of that please. Others could barely look at the video, which they said creeped them out. Some people even thought the creature was an alien. Rat-tailed maggots are often less than an inch long but the tail can be as long as six inches when completely extended. These are the immature stage of flies that resemble honey bees.

Four armed hunters are patrolling the perimeter of the grounds in Yakutia region, the coldest area of Russia. The “wily” mother bear has been sending her two cubs to raid the kitchen rubbish skips far-flung Bereg Druzhby camp, say reports. Security has been stepped up after an outcry from parents.  Initially officials at the state-run summer retreat drafted in an 83 year old hunter to provide security - but he failed to scare away the bear, leading to fury from parents over the safety of their children . Since then three more professional hunters have been deployed on a round the clock watch. The hunters have had the cubs in their sights but not shot at them - because the mother would become enraged and unpredictable.  Head of the Aldan district Severin Pozdnyakov said: ‘There are bear traps set all around the camp. “Four hunters are on 24/7 patrol. “We will not kill the bears unless there is direct threat. “This is not an unusual situation for us. “We live in the taiga, this is part of our life.” Camp director Alexander Mekhedov admitted the cubs, one a baby and the other one year old, “keep roaming the camp”.  He said: The cubs don’t walk about the whole camp site, they just run towards the kitchen area, quickly grab bags with rubbish and flee. “They are easy to shoot, but we won’t do it. “The territory is properly fenced, the animals won’t break through. “There is no need to start evacuation, everything is under control.”  Igor Sakhno, deputy head of Aldan district who is in charge of the camp, was accused of complacency by the local media after saying he did not see anything “big” to worry about with the bears prowling the vicinity. The mother circles around the camp, but has not herself entered the territory, say local reports. Currently there are 200 children at the camp, aged from seven to 15. Some children at the holiday centre are in foster care while others are handicapped.

They have to travel to Laurencekirk or Aberdeen and the kids are normally having to rely on parents for transport.“Hopefully the money can help towards that.“We’re self-funded so any money that we can get externally is always welcome and it always goes back towards the kids.“The club is getting bigger. We’ve got quite a lot of members and we’re going to go into the national league, so it would be timed quite well.”The club has become popular with locals in Menzieshill and beyond and regularly offers open-play nights as well as squad sessions.Heather says the club prides itself on being family-friendly and offering people of all backgrounds an opportunity to play, including children and adults with additional needs.She added: “A lot of people say how family friendly the club is and we take in people of all needs to take part.“We have our under-10s session on Fridays at 4.30pm, then the under-12s after that and then the under-14s.“On Wednesdays we open up the court for people to just come down and play.“The money would definitely be a great help to us.”The last chance to collect tokens will be in tomorrow’s Weekend .At least 50 tokens need to be collected to secure a share of the money.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil excited about new signing kharl madianga","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann was delighted to see practice pay off at a key moment in the 2-0 Betfred Cup win at Peterhead.With the scores locked at 0-0 against a disciplined Blue Toon line-up, the Dark Blues eventually made their dominance count after half-time as new signing Kharl Madianga rattled in his first goal for the club.Joining the play late, the 24-year-old arrived on the edge of the area, created space for the shot before smashing past the goalkeeper.And gaffer Neil says that late arrival is something the team worked hard on in the pre-season training camp in Portugal.He was also delighted to see one of his new boys get off the mark in a Dundee shirt – especially after an extended time off the park due to an off-field dispute with his former club, Lokomotiv GO.Neil said: “Sunday was Kharl Madianga’s first game in a year and I asked him the last time he scored – I don’t think he could remember!“He’s got loads to offer. From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot.

When I saw Jim coming over, my heart was booming.“From then on our love flourished.”Five years later, after Jim proposed in Dublin, the happy couple were married at the High Kirk in Dundee on July 19 1958.In preparation for the big day, Jim lost a stone in weight, which he claims was due to all the worry.Isabella looked stunning in a white lace ballerina-style dress which she says still has “tomato stains down the front”.Jim and Isabella went on to have two sons and a daughter, and 10 grandchildren have followed.Isabella said: “Family has always been first and foremost in our life and to this day we still have a close bond with our family.“We enjoy cruises and have travelled the world, with our children occasionally joining us.”Sixty years is a long time but Jim and Isabella say the secret behind how long they have stayed together so long is very easy.“Our marriage has been based on love, trust and happiness,” said Isabella.“The problem with couples these days is that they just don’t trust each other.“For us it was love at first sight and to this day we still care so much about each other.”The Martins will be celebrating their anniversary with friends and family at Invercarse Hotel next week.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it. It is hard and scary to take that step but I am so glad I did it. I can really put my heart and soul into my pieces now.“I should have done it way sooner.”Scarlett’s workshops allow couples to have a personal touch at their wedding.A growing number of couples are visiting her studios to create their wedding rings – and some of those ready to get down on one knee are even coming to create a bespoke engagement ring for their other half.Scarlett said: “The workshops are incredibly popular and weddings are becoming a lot more DIY with couples wanting to be more hands on.“I love being part of the love story of making their rings.“We also hold hen parties a lot and brides love to come in and make matching silver rings with their bridesmaids.“It is a lot of fun.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people solicitors move up at law firm","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish law firm Thorntons has promoted 11 solicitors this month.Two have been promoted to associates and nine have been made senior solicitors across the Dundee, Fife, Perth, Angus and Edinburgh offices.The two new associates are Lynne MacIntyre and Stuart Mackie, and the senior solicitors are Steven Drake, Joanne Clancy, Lynsay McFarlane, Thomas Redpath, Neil Falconer, Megan Sweeney, Chris Gardiner and Anneli Spence.Chairman Colin Graham said: “Training and development is a core part of our growth strategy.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people spar customers raise cash for good causes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Spar store on Ballindean Road in the Douglas area of Dundee has been raising funds for a number of local good causes, including Brown Street Kennels, The Crescent in Whitfield and seven-year-old Garvie Winter, who is being treated for leukaemia.Kirsty Laing, from the store, said: “We do quite a lot of different things in the shop to raise money.“We sell a lot of books, mostly for 50p, which are really popular and we also get a lot of little things from customers who want to sell them to raise funds too.

He has fantastic pace and loves to run at defences. He is strong on both feet, and I believe he will excite our fans,” said Csaba.After an unsuccessful spell in the Turkish second tier, Loemba is keen to get going in Scottish football.“I am happy to be with Dundee United, I am excited to play in Scotland and want to bring joy to our fans,” he said.Vastic comes in as United look to complete the final part of their rebuilding process since the end of last season.While Csaba is pleased to have secured the services of strikers Nicky Clark and Craig Curran earlier in the summer, he wants more height in his attack. At well over six feet, the former Blackburn and Bayern Munich kid fits the bill on that score.And, over the next few days, the coaching staff will see if he is up to scratch in terms of his all-round striking ability.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united duo face fitness checks ahead of elgin city clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Curran and Callum Booth will face fitness checks before Csaba Laszlo decides his line-up for Dundee United’s Betfred Cup trip to Elgin today.Injury means the pair, regarded as among the most significant of the Tangerines’ summer signings, have hardly been seen in the games played so far.Curran’s only public appearance to date was in the friendly at Brechin earlier this month and he’s been struggling to shake off a dead leg.But Csaba remains hopeful he’ll be ready for next week’s Championship opener with Dunfermline.And, if he’s fit enough to manage 45 minutes at Borough Briggs, it would be a major step in the right direction.Booth, meanwhile, took a knock in the defeat at Ross County last week and that ruled him out of the home tie against Alloa.While the former Partick Thistle full-back’s condition is not causing concern, United would like him to get another game under his belt before the league.In line for debuts could be latest recruits Paul Watson and Yannik Loemba.Watson, who arrived from Falkirk last week, is likely to partner Frederic Frans at the heart of the defence, while wide man Loemba is could be on the wing.Having not played since the turn of the year, the 28-year-old is likely to need a few weeks to get his fitness up to scratch.With qualification out reach for both, all that’s at stake today is avoiding the wooden spoon.Csaba sees this as vital preparation for next week.“Especially before the season begins, I say always this is the most important game for the confidence, just to win,” said Csaba.“You do and you know you can score goals.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united hand trial to former bayern munich and blackburn rovers star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo will have a look a player with a strong football pedigree as he tries to add to his attacking options at Dundee United.Today will see Austria Vienna reserve striker Toni Vastic arrive for a trial with the Tangerines.Now 25, Vastic spent time with both Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich’s second team in his younger days and also has experience of top flight football in his native Austria.And his father Ivica, though born in Croatia, won 50 caps for Austria between 1996 and 2008 as well as starring for the likes of Strum Graz and Austria Vienna, for whom he is now a youth coach.Csaba did not confirm Vastic is the player he was bringing over but did concede it was a striker from Vienna who is strong in the air and there is no doubt Vastic is that man.It was through the manager’s contacts in central Europe that the deal to bring him over for a tryout was done.“We are working to bring players in. I don’t make any secret that we are bringing someone in from Austria Vienna, a big striker, I can have a look at,” said Csaba.“We are talking with one other player and hope the signings can be made, the deals are done.“I hope by next week we will have a complete team.”United also hope to be boosted by the sight of another new striker, Craig Curran, making his debut when they complete their Betfred Cup campaign at Elgin City this Saturday.Curran was due back in training today after the dead leg that’s sidelined him for the past two weeks.If he completes his work over the next couple of days without suffering a reaction, he will be on duty up north and back on course to be ready for the league kick-off against Dunfermline next week.“We have been working on Craig and, if he is OK, he can get 45 minutes against Elgin and that would be good news.”Defender Callum Booth is another who has been in the wars but could be back on duty at the weekend.The former Partick Thistle man picked up a knock at Ross County last week and missed out against Alloa but could be ready over the next couple of days.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/10/glamis-castle-by-John-Ireland-of-Barry-Downs-by-Carnoustie.JPG.jpg ","title":"local castle to mark 40 years of film classic grease with outdoor screening","story":"\t\t\t\t\tGlamis Castle will be celebrating the 40th anniversary of hit movie Grease in style by holding a special outdoor screening.The film – starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John – will be shown on an 8x4ft inflatable screen next month.Fans can snap up tickets at £8 for adults and £4 for children and relive the classic movie that first hit the big screen in 1978.Organiser Blue Monkey Events has advised cinema-goers to bring their own chairs.Food and refreshments will be available.Grease, which has grossed $400 million worldwide, follows the trials and tribulations of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies in the 1950s.The event has already generated a lot of interest as Glamis Castle will be turned into Rydell High for the night.

If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

the discussions.There have been nine meetings to date.Three more are scheduled to follow.The board has hit back, insisting that \"organisational change is managed within existing resources\".Such a reason is regularly given by public bodies when questioned about the use of staff time that is clearly beyond their regular, scheduled\u0026nbsp duties.The union has complained that morale among security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the security department was apparently prompted \"because an ex manager has the view that the guards don\u0026rsquot have enough work to do\".The GMB\u0027 regional officer Liz Gordon calculates that the process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of

Cowie-Mcinnes (41) was shocked to receive a letter from Highland Council warning her that she needed official permission to host the event on the town\u0027 beach.She feared there was no way she could complete the lengthy application process in time or find the \u0026pound559 required for a public entertainment licence. She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page

has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact the owners have to make the right decision for their own interest but we have to make sure we represent the public interest and that it is protected as far as the law will allow us to do that.\"Agent for the site owners, Gary Johnston, said they would not comment at this time.The last public announcement made by two of them \u0026ndash Mr Ali and Mr Cheng \u0026ndash came in a statement last month where they claimed \"a new way forward\" was being investigated, but would not elaborate on what that entailed.No more details were forthcoming when the Courier contacted Mr Johnston more recently.Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It looks like the people of Inverness don\u0026rsquot care.\"Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice lies just beyond the former hostel in Stephens Brae, branded the ongoing situation \"a complete disgrace\", and repeated his previous calls for the council to compulsorily purchase the building.\"It has been \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo since day one,\" he said.\"Mr Haas has been trying to keep everyone happy and now no-one is happy.\"Mr Haas insisted a lot of work is continuing \"behind the scenes\", including council officers working with the owners to provide the appropriate information to enable planning officials to provide, in return, the right advice regarding the outstanding planning application.\"We need facts and once we have the facts we can move forward,\" he said.\"We absolutely have the public interest at heart.

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Saturday 28 Jul 2018 11:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116757.jpg","title":"Plans lodged for Inverness Airport hotel","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW hotel just five minutes from Inverness Airport will set the stage for a business boom, it has been claimed.Proposals for a 130-bedroom development to be run by a \"well-known international hotel chain\" on the site of the Inverness Airport Business Park (IABP) have been lodged with Highland Council, months after the idea appeared to receive a somewhat muted response.It was\u0026nbspreported last November how an online video promoting the hotel vision by IABP had attracted barely 300 views over the course of a month.Chairman James Campbell, however, insisted there was a strong case for additional hotel accommodation across Inverness.As the plans were unveiled this week, he said: \"This planning application is further proof of the strength of the local economy and sets the stage for us to welcome more major businesses to IABP.\"The proximity of IABP to Inverness Airport allows businesses to benefit from the airport\u0027 excellent connectivity and international trade routes.\"With record traffic and passenger figures in recent years, Inverness Airport continues to go from strength to strength.

leg","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoss Derek McInnes today warned Aberdeen will be stronger in the return against Burnley – and backed them to score a vital away goal.Following a 1-1 draw at Pittodrie the Dons must score in the Europa League return at Turf Moor on Thursday if they are to progress.The Reds were closing in on a memorable Euro victory over Premier League Burnley until they conceded a late goal.Yet McInnes reckons his squad have the confidence and character to get a result in the second qualifying round second leg.And the Reds gaffer pointed to the 1-0 win over Premiership winners Celtic at Parkhead last season for inspiration of what can be done.He said: “There is a feeling that we can score down there as we had enough good moments in the game to suggest that can be the case.“If we score down there it is game on.“The onus is on us to score obviously but we have scored away from home against good teams before.“We won 1-0 at Celtic Park last time out in front of 60,000 in a high-pressure game.“I have the players who have the confidence and personality to take the challenge on and try to win the game at Turf Moor.“Normally when we have played good opponents in Europe we have had to score that away goal“We created enough and had enough good moments to suggest we can do that again.“We are still in the game.”Aberdeen have secured memorable away victories over Siroki Brijeg (Bosnia), RNK Rijeka (Croatia) and Groningen (Holland) to progress in Europe under McInnes.The Battle of Britain was Aberdeen’s first competitive game of the season and McInnes admits they ran out of steam late on.However he reckons his squad will be even fitter and sharper for the return leg.He said: “The players will take confidence from that performance but they will also be a bit sharper and stronger through the legs for having had that game.“We ran out of legs a wee bit. “That is nothing new because when we have played in Europe, in that first game it is difficult to sustain that levels.“Last season against Siroki we ran our race after about 70 minutes.“Out there (in Bosnia) we were so much better physically because we had that game time in the first leg.“That game against Burnley is worth two weeks of training as you cannot replicate that through friendlies or training.“We will be that step closer in terms of fitness and where we want to be.”The Red Army honoured Gothenburg Great Neale Cooper, who sadly recently passed away, with a magnificent display and banner before kick-off.McInnes said: “You saw Aberdeen in its full splendour.“A packed Pittodrie with a great display for a great man at the start of the game.”McInnes revealed he had to pitch new signing Tommie Hoban in at left back at short notice after Andy Considine was ruled out through sickness less than three hours before kick-off.Hoban had only completed a loan move from Premier League Watford on the eve of the Burnley clash.McInnes said: “Tommie Hoban did brilliant considering he was told at 5 o’clock he was playing left back as Considine was ill.“These sort of things are there to test us but we equipped ourselves very well against a very good team who I have a high regard for.”Aberdeen took an early lead through a penalty converted by Gary Mackay-Steven and were closing in a vital victory.However Welsh international Sam Vokes came off the bench to net a leveller with 10 minutes remaining.“We set out to win the game and I am disappointed we didn’t when I see the effort the boys put in,” said McInnes.“For our first competitive game the standard of play was really good from us and we had organisation and carried a threat.“Burnley were excellent in terms of asking questions of us in the second half.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"1300luxury living for the

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"graham love is leaving macpool","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 2:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGraham Love is moving on from Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s MacPool at the end of July.MacPool will be looking to recruit a new pool manager after the summer.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:26 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact PCT co-coordinator Alex Wilson at admin@peeblescommunity.org\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

pyrotechnics.While some younger children weren\u0026#8217t too keen on the clowns, who interacted with the audience throughout much of the performance, others found them the most amusing, their slapstick capers eliciting some of the biggest laughs.The most heart-stopping moments came from aerial artiste, Alexandra, whose skills on an elevated hoop were astounding, and one of the Jackson Family, who balanced precariously atop a ladder.Other tense moments came from an entertainer who spun various items at the same time with her hands and feet, including a pole that was on fire at either end, the audience waiting to see if it would plummet into the stands.Even the more basic stunts, like juggling, had an added element of tension, with the objects, resembling yo-yos, launched many feet into the air by a rope.The animal-free circus continued its UK tour, leaving Campbeltown on Thursday morning heading for Arran, before bringing the magic to Annan in Dumfries and Galloway and arriving in Appleby today (Friday).Alexandra impressed the crowd with her aerial acrobatics. 50_c30montinicircus02The room was on tenterhooks as one of the Jackson Family stood atop a ladder.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.

I thought then \u0026lsquowhat makes mine any different?\u0026rsquo and realised that maybe it\u0026rsquos not the plan, it\u0026rsquos the people who\u0026rsquove got a problem between their ears. I then went to Thailand on a course and it\u0026rsquos all gone from there.  John, a former Ross High School pupil, initially worked with youth football clubs across the county while trying to make a breakthrough to top-level players. He said: \u0026ldquoI sent messages, filled out contact forms and heard nothing until this time last year, when John [Souttar] got in touch.  \u0026ldquoI think there is a bit of a stigma because it\u0026rsquos psychology and people think you\u0026rsquove got to have a \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo but it\u0026rsquos not about that.  \u0026ldquoI focus on three things: mindset, the player as a person and their performance. I believe that a better person is a better player so what they do off the pitch is massively important.  And he explained how he worked with players on an individual basis, saying: \u0026ldquoI get to know the players.  \u0026ldquoSomeone could be struggling with self-confidence, or we all know what social media is like \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos where I come in to help them.  John, a former Ormiston player who hung up his boots to focus on his business, is now hoping he can reach the top of the game.  \u0026ldquoI want to be the best and I want my clients to be the best as well, he said. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot get as excited about the players\u0026rsquo achievements as maybe I should because I\u0026rsquom always looking towards the next [target]."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064419.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"family-join-together-in-memory-of-rev-jennifer-macrae","story":"  The family of the Rev Jennifer Macrae are taking on a series of running challenges across Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout the summer to collect funds for Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre.  The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.  In past years, East Lothian has been the backdrop for films including The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg\u0027s The BFG.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-at-scotlands-national-airshow-2018-on-saturday","story":"  Final preparations are under way for the event, which will see the acrobatic squad perform a new Centenary Split manoeuvre, specially introduced into their 2018 display to mark this year\u0026rsquos 100th anniversary of the RAF.

The first such base would be the Clyde, which would be expected to churn out vessels - both complex Type 26 frigates already on order and a future replacement of T ype 45 destroyers - using the same basic hull.    Scotstoun yard where frigate factory was planned  Such a long-term commitment, he said, should enable BAE Systems to invest in the kind of covered dock hall where such vessels could be made away from Glasgow\u0026rsquos rain and wind for decades to come.  Mr Sweeney said: \u0026ldquoIt is important that BAE seeks that sort of long-term commitment from the MoD that would give it the confidence to look at investment in a facility like the so-called frigate factory.  A single factory - as opposed to the current arrangements across both the Scotstoun and Govan yards - should cut the unit costs of every ship it makes. It would also create new capacity on the Clyde for other work.  The MoD this week shelved a competition for another, cheaper kind of frigate, a type 31 for which the Upper Clyde yards cannot compete because of capacity issues.  Rival bids for this work - originally assumed to be heading to the Upper Clyde - would include potential multi-site manufacturing in England and Scotland.  Mr Sweeney said\u0026nbspType 31s could be made at sites such as Cammell Laird at Mersey or Rosyth on the Forth. Such vessels are designed for what the navy calls constabulary duties - fighting pirates or providing aid - rather than a full-on war with the navies of a modern state. But they nevertheless \u0026ldquopack a punch, said Mr Sweeney and have export potential.  But Type 31s may well end up being sold as \u0026ldquonearly new after a few years of service in the Royal Navy, meaning a buyer state would avoid any snagging issues.  He said: \u0026ldquoThat would maintain a constant production of the 31e. So the aspiration is to continuously produce two standard classes of ships for the Royal Navy.  Mr Sweeney, however, remains concerned that what he described as Tory \u0026ldquocutthroat competition for orders between yards would scupper a revival.    Paul Sweeney congratuled as he is elected in 2017  Britain currently has 19 major fighting ships. It needs 24 to meet its international and domestic commitments, according to current thinking.  BAE did not comment on whether it could renew its frigate factory plan. The company did, however, echo MOD messaging that Type 26 orders secured shipbuilding on the Clyde for 20 years."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7441974.jpg?type=article-full","title":"donald-campbells-bluebird-to-fly-again-in-scotland","story":"  But now the Bluebird K7, which propelled the adventurer Donald Campbell to seven world records, is to take to the water once more.  After a 17-year project to restore the jet-engined hydroplane after lifting in from the depths of Coniston Water in the Lake District, engineer Bill Smith will bring the Bluebird to the Isle of Bute for trials next week.  It is the first time the superspeed craft has been put back into action since it was raised in 2001, and more than half a century since Campbell\u0027s final, fatal attempt to break the world water speed record.  The daredevil, the only person to hold both the world land and water speed records simultaneously, lost his life on 4 January 1967 when the Bluebird crashed during his second attempt to break his own record, flipping over as it reached speeds of 320 mph and sinking beneath the waves.  The craft was eventually recovered in 2001, and it has taken almost 20 painstaking years and a small army of dedicated volunteers to restore the Bluebird to her former glory.    The Bluebirn in full flight on Coniston  From 4th to 16th August, the iconic craft will undertaking crew training on Bute\u0027s Loch Fad, although it will be moving at a considerably slower pace than it did in its creator\u0027s day.  Project leader Mr Smith has had a love of Bute since fishing trips as a teenager and then later as a diver. He said: \"Loch Fad is perfect for this crew-training exercise.  \"It\u0027s just long enough for Bluebird to get moving and just deep enough that it won\u0027t be too difficult for divers to retrieve any dropped tools.\"  \"It\u0027s pretty exciting for us right now because we\u0027ve just ground-tested Bluebird and all her systems are running beautifully. When she\u0027s put in the water at Loch Fad next week, it will be the first time in 50 years that Bluebird\u0027s engine will be started while afloat.\"  The bluebird suffered catastrophic damage in the crash which cost Campbell his life, and was hidden by the murky waters of Coniston for decades, although the location was pinpointed by a group of divers from the Royal marines shortly after the crash, but kept a secret.  When it was rediscovered by Mr Smith, there were moves to have it left in situ, but it was eventually raised to stop it becoming a magnet for souvenir hunters.  The body of Donald Campbell was located two months later, still in the green jumpsuit he wore during the final run. An inquest later found he had been decapitated by the Bluebird\u0027s plastic windshield.    Bill Smith with the wreck of the Bluebird  Mr Smith, said that there would be \"no goosebumps\" when he sees the famous hydroplane take to the water again.  Around a dozen different crew members will be required to get the Bluebird moving again, and it will be piloted by professional hydroplane pilot Ted Walsh.  The Bluebird was raised mostly intact, but the team were forced to start over again because the original structure was made half an inch adrift.  Companies in North Shields, where Mr Smith is based, also helped with its restoration. Rolls-Royce Controls and Data recreated the original 1967 fuel system from plans found in archives.  Mr Smith only plans to aim for speeds of around 65mph for demonstrations purposes.  He said: \"It\u0027s taken us 17 years to get to this point. But it\u0027s not the end of the journey. The trip to Scotland is get the crew prepared for the final trials we hope to do in Cumbria. It\u0027s another step in the road.\"  Mr Smith said that he fully expects things to go wrong during the trials. In fact, having everything be plain sailing would be counter to the way Donald Campbell approached his record-breaking runs.  He said: \"The Bluebird was always a work in progress and Campbell was always making changes to the design. If he hadn\u0027t crashed he would have been back for another go having made alterations and adaptions to the craft.  \"We\u0027ll have to fix little problems and hope that nothing major cocks up. There will be holes that need filed with silicon and bits that need fixed down, and lots of small snags to smooth over and get everything shipshape. But we\u0027re confident that the Bluebird will work as it should.\"    Campbell began started his career using his father\u0027s old boat, the Bluebird K4, but after a structural failure at 170 mph in 1951 he developed the Bluebird K7.  He championed British engineering his entire life and saw the Bluebird, and his land speed records, as a national foil to the feats of the space race being undertaken by the US and the USSR at the time.\u0026nbsp  He first broke the record in 1955 with a speed of 202mph.\u0026nbsp That rose to 260mph by 1959. By 1966, his record stood at 276mph.  Although he reached a speed more than 300mph in the fateful 1967 attempt he did not smash his previous record as he failed to complete the journey.    The fatal crash  Mr Smith believes that Campbell would by proud to see the Bluebird fly again, adding: \"Donald Campbell was a bit of a showman and he used to say that there\u0027s no such thing as bad publicity.  \"He talked a good job and did it very well at drumming up publicity. He would have loved this.\"  Mr Smith said: \"When we raised the Bluebird his wife, Tonia, was beside me on the boat and I looked over at the shoreline and there was 200 reporters and TV cameras and satellite trucks lines up.  \"I asked her \u0027do you think Donald would have liked this?\u0027, and she just laughed and said that he would have absolutely thrived on it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"major-fringe-venue-creates-new-contracts-with-employees-after-discussions-with-workers-union","story":"  The union and Summerhall, a privately run arts complex in the south of Edinburgh, have agreed to a \"landmark\" pay and conditions agreement which the union says is the first of its kind in the capital.

Anthony Alderson, who runs the equally key Pleasance venue, said: \"We are delighted that Summerhall is being able to take the steps they have done this week.  \"Pleasance are committed to offering the very best opportunities to the many people who come back year on year to take part.  \"It is important to recognise that there are several different models and one size does not fit all.\"  The Pleasance has a team of 200 volunteers at the Fringe this year.

The writers are part of a campaign run by Scottish PEN, the freedom of expression group, in parallel with the The Herald\u0027s own Freedom of Speech campaign.  They remain concerned that unreformed laws are having a chilling effect on investigative journalists, scientists and - especially - local bloggers trying to expose wrongdoing by the rich and powerful. England and Wales have moved to bring their defamation laws i n to line with the internet age. Scotland has not followed suit.  The writers, who also include\u0026nbspSara Sheridan, Zoe Strachan, Philippe Sands, Karen Campbell, Christopher Brookmyre, Ron Butlin and Louise Welsh, said that \u0026ldquoprotecting free expression cannot wait any longer\".  They added: \"Every moment reform is delayed, writers, academics, scientists, journalists and social media users remain at risk from being threatened by legal action on the most minor of issues.  The Scottish Law Commission produced a draft bill in December 2017, which included an English-style \"serious harm\" threshold to prevent trivial cases or those brought solely to silence criticism. The Law Commission also proposed created a statutory defence of publication on a matter of public interest and a single publication rule to ensure the time period within which a defamation action can be brought does not restart every time a link or post is shared or viewed online.  Nik Williams, Project Manager of Scottish PEN said: \u0026ldquoIt would be a missed opportunity for the First Minister to ignore the work and opinions of the Scottish Law Commission and the hundreds of people who took part in the public consultations to delay reform until September 2019.  \"Scotland\u0026rsquos defamation laws are already significantly out-of-date and wholly inadequate for free expression in the modern age and any delay in reforming defamation law will continue to stifle public discourse and the ability of people to hold the powerful to account.  Poet and novelist, James Robertson added : \u0026ldquoThe law of defamation in Scotland has not been revised in any significant way since before the Scottish Parliament was established, while in the same period the context of news media, public expression and communication has changed beyond all recognition.  \"We need the law to recognise this new world, protecting both freedom of expression and reasonable rights of privacy, both key areas of a fully-functioning democracy.

But now the forgotten history of one of the country\u0027s most celebrated marvels is beginning to be told, thanks to a new exhibition which raises awkward questions about the role the slave trade played in its foundation.  Leading Jamaican-born academic and human rights campaigner Sir Geoff Palmer, Emeritus Professor in the School of Life Sciences at Heriot-Watt University and also Scotland\u0027s first black professor, has given stinging critique in an interview with The Herald on how \"slavery is the history of the New Town\", down to how it shaped individual homes.    He said James Craig and Robert Adam\u0027s streets were partly owned by slave plantation owners or funders, with often hundreds of slaves in their keep.  He said: \"After emancipation in 1833, people were given compensation (for the loss of slaves) because officially the slaves were property.  \"If you look at the New Town, on the compensation list you will find various areas like India Street, Albany Street, Forth Street and nearby Rodney Street.  \"For example, when you look at one building you would think it is just an ordinary house.  \"But when you look at it carefully, which I have - and it is on the compensation list - the person there who received money for their slaves is the only house that has a balcony.\"  He said:\u0026nbsp\"If you go to another, also on the compensation list, it has two doors to the one house.  \"It is not just that a lot of the houses in the New Town are on the compensation list, those which are on the compensation list have got appointments (fittings), have got differences - so having slaves made your house different.\"  The compensation list includes 320 Edinburgh addresses belonging to 148 individuals.  One in Forth Street was compensated \u0026pound277 for nine slaves in Tobago, another in Albany Street received \u0026pound1,996 for 104 \u0026ldquoenslaved\" in Jamaica, and one Dundas Street home-owner got \u0026ldquo\u0026pound2,956 15s 6d for 194 slaves in St Ann, also Jamaica.  In all, the British government paid out \u0026pound20m to compensate about 3,000 families that owned slaves for the loss of \"property\" when slave-ownership was abolished - the equivalent of around \u0026pound16.5bn today.  Prof Palmer said much of the management of slave funds would have come under the head of one of the biggest banks, the former first Lord of the Admiralty - who is commemorated on the 150ft plinth in the city\u0027s St Andrew Square, itself the subject of discussions on adding a plaque outlining his slavery connections - Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville.  He said: \"The one we all know about is Dundas, because he was a politician, but he is significant because he controlled and managed the people who would have had property in the New Town.  \"He was the governor of the Bank of Scotland. He was funding slavery. He was the great patronage giver.  \"Dundas proposed that slavery should be gradually abolished.  \"Dundas did that in order to counteract those people who wanted immediate abolition.  \"Some historians said he wasn\u0026rsquot a bad guy because he wanted to do it gradually so that was better.  \"It\u0026rsquos not. It was a deception.  \"This was how he protected the people who lived in the New Town.  \"My view - and I know the present viscount - is that I don\u0026rsquot want the statue to be taken down or damaged, because once you start removing things, that\u0026rsquos removing the evidence, and you remove the deed.  \"I would like to see the truth of what was done on the plaque, that he was the proponent of gradual abolition of slavery that kept the trade going for 15 years longer than it should.\"  He added:\u0026nbsp\"What that means was 42,000 slaves who were transported each year by Britain would not have been.  \"That is the history of the New Town.\"  Henry Dundas was ultimately impeached over misappropriation of public money.    The Edinburgh World Heritage Trust\u0026nbspsaid the Tron Kirk exhibition, which also highlights Scotland\u0026rsquos other five World Heritage Sites, sets out the formal reasons for the city\u0026rsquos Unesco inscription, but also \"challenges residents and visitors to think differently about the city and consider some uncomfortable questions\".  These\u0026nbspinclude the absence of women in the city\u0026rsquos many grand statues and monuments and whether we are doing enough to conserve the authenticity of the site.

Her comments come at a time when there is an increasing focus on research as a way of boosting the income of universities.  University rankings, which are seen as crucial to the recruitment of students both at home and overseas, are also heavily weighted towards research output.  Ms McDougall said the skills required to be the best researcher were not the same as the skills required to be a great educator.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe journey to becoming an academic is very focussed on research skills with the pressure to publish and remain active in research, but there is not the same focus on educational skills.  \u0026ldquoIt is not surprising that many do not excel at teaching unless they have a natural ability and, given a number of undergraduate courses are taught by graduate teaching assistants, many of whom are only a few years ahead of the graduates they\u0026rsquore teaching, means we cannot expect them to be naturally gifted educators.  Ms McDougall, who was speaking at a teaching excellence summit at Glasgow University run by the Times Higher Education magazine, called for universities to spend more time developing academics.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe require primary and secondary school teachers to undergo intensive training before we allow them into the classroom, but we don\u0026rsquot expect the same from academics and I don\u0026rsquot really understand why there is a general assumption that academics can teach without dedicated training.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a lot more time invested by universities in developing academics as educators. That would help students feel more valued.  \u0026ldquoSometimes there is a risk for undergraduate students to feel sidelined by research activity in a university and we are all very aware of the tensions that exist for academics between splitting their time.  \u0026ldquoSometimes there is a tendency for undergraduates to feel secondary - an afterthought - to the main activity of research in a research-intensive university.  Mary Senior, Scotland Official for the University and College Union, which represents lecturers, said teaching was of a high quality, but could be affected by staff contracts which were often insecure.  She said: \u0026ldquoAccredited teacher training courses and qualifications should be accessible to all members of academic staff, and flexible enough to reflect major disciplinary differences within higher education.  \u0026ldquoThe real issue is teaching-only contracts can mean the exploitation of staff on casual contracts, and the fact that, although students often don\u0026rsquot realise it, most of them will be taught at some point by people on insecure casual contracts.  A spokesman for Universities Scotland, which represents principals, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a long-stated position of our members that research informs teaching and there will also be a fine balancing act to ensure that students and academics get the most out of both elements."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-we-must-to-stand-up-to-this-new-breed-of-right-wing-hard-men","story":"  I first encountered the phenomenon as a teenager in the early 1980s when neighbours and older relatives returned to ours for drinks after Saturday night parish fund-raising dances.

But your own theories were still forming and anyway you would be chided affectionately for spending too much time among university beer hall Communists and not enough of it at lectures.  You wanted to tell them too that Mrs Thatcher had waged a doctrinal and cultural war on the miners. She had done this as a means of destroying the trade union movement, the biggest obstacle separating her from her dream of society driven purely by market forces and where the worth of a person was measured only by their ability to turn a profit. In vain, you sought to appeal to their robust Christianity and the story of the money-changers in the temple and the Good Samaritan, only to be told that Mick McGahey and Arthur Scargill were God-hating Communists.  Looking back, you wished you had possessed the information gained many years later. Thus you would have been able to tell them that MI5 had infiltrated the National Union of Mineworkers to disseminate the lie, aided by Robert Maxwell and the Daily Mirror, that Mr Scargill was on the take. You could have shown how coal-mining was still a profitable industry when the last remaining pits began to shut and that Mrs Thatcher had spent \u0026pound7 billion paying off working miners and making wastelands of their communities. Thus billions more were lost in productivity, unemployment benefits and the increased pressure on local health services and that you lot would be next up against the wall when Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos bell tolls again.

Ah, but what about the right to take ownership of our own council houses? And then you could have asked them who they thought benefited most from that. What a boon that was to the financial services industry: millions of new customers clamouring for easy mortgages at crippling rates and the certain knowledge that unemployment, an unforeseen economic corrugation, sudden health issues and divorce would inevitably result in sweet multitudes of repossessions and the creation of the money-laundering state.

It floats on the multitudes of voters in North America\u0026rsquos rust belt who turned out for Donald Trump in 2016 and on the blue-collar vote in Britain that is sweeping the country out of the EU.  In the US it\u0026rsquos permitted President Trump and his chief propagandist Steve Bannon to proclaim that they are standing up for \u0026ldquothe little man and all those who have felt locked out or otherwise disenfranchised from Washington\u0026rsquos decision-making. Nigel Farage and his lickspittles in the UK Conservative Party have propagated a similar fiction.  On the day after the EU referendum I visited Hartlepool, a solidly-working class town on England\u0026rsquos North Sea coast which had just voted 70-30 to leave the EU. This is traditional Labour territory but fuelled by a sense of despair and resentment that its old car manufacturing and fishing industries had been allowed to run down and that nothing meaningful had replaced them. Each of the dozen or so local people who talked to me cited immigration as the principal factor in their decision to vote Leave. There didn\u0026rsquot seem to be that many immigrants in Hartlepool but decades of anti-immigrant stories in the English red-tops and the richly-funded lies of the Leave campaign had found their mark here.  The affluent extremists who have annexed Conservative policies across Europe and the US despise the blue-collar communities whose vote they kidnapped. They despise their Hicksville concerns their beer and reality television addictions their Three Lions and their barbecue complexions. They are valuable only as fodder to help Trump, Bannon, Boris Johnson and Farage attain power and thence to deploy it to bring about an 18th century society where the weak and the poor know their place where women are chattels and where minorities are marginalised.  The trick is to avert their gaze by making enemies out of other nations other cultures and colours and blaming them for their ills. The odd war helps too and carries the bonus of business opportunities for all their main political donors. It is the traditional means by which all Conservative governments maintain control and sew division. In the hands of Donald Trump, Steve Bannon and Boris Johnson it has become something more bestial."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-why-putins-army-of-spooks-have-set-their-sights-on-a-tiny-ex-yugoslav-state","story":"  That Mr Trump in a subsequent television interview lambasted Montenegro claiming that Montenegrins were \u0026ldquovery aggressive, while ludicrously suggesting its recent membership of Nato might trigger World War III, only convinced observers that this was Mr Trump speaking on Mr Putin\u0026rsquos behalf.  Most likely such notions were planted in the US President\u0026rsquos mind during that one-to-one session in Helsinki with his Russian counterpart. It\u0026rsquos long been no secret that Moscow by hook or by crook did all it could to prevent Montenegro becoming the latest Nato member, even though the little Balkan nation finally succeeded in doing so last year much to the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chagrin.  Working therefore on the basis that Mr Putin has had remarkable success in inducing Mr Trump to promote the Kremlin\u0026rsquos interests and parrot its agenda, it\u0026rsquos probably fair to expect another small Balkan country to become the subject of both men\u0026rsquos ire in the coming months.  I\u0026rsquom talking of course about Macedonia, or to give it its proper name as known at the United Nations, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom).  Names matter here, indeed in \u0026ldquoMacedonia\u0026rsquos case what the country is actually called is already impacting on its future political direction of travel and will almost certainly bring it opprobrium from the Kremlin and therefore de-facto Mr Trump.  But before looking at such a prospect, it\u0026rsquos first necessary to rewind back to where the contentious issue of Macedonia\u0026rsquos name comes from and an agreement it signed last month with Greece.  It was in 1991 in the wake of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia that Greece\u0026rsquos northern neighbour called itself Macedonia.  For its part Greece was none to pleased and objected to the name, fearing territorial claims and ambitions on its eponymous northern region that includes the country\u0026rsquos second city, Thessaloniki.  The fledging Macedonia did little to defuse Greek anger with among other gestures calling its main airport in its capital Skopje after Ancient Greek hero Alexander. All this though is itself now history, given that after years of bickering, protests and talks the two neighbours have now reached an agreement.  Under the deal, signed on June 17, Macedonia agreed to change its name to Republic of North Macedonia. In return Greece has agreed to end its long-standing blockade of Macedonia\u0026rsquos membership of Nato and the EU.  As so often happens in the Balkans though, not everything is that straightforward.  For starters if the deal is to be fully implemented, then Macedonians must show their support in a referendum and likewise the Greek parliament must be on side.  For the moment it\u0026rsquos the first of these domestic political hurdles that is proving the trickiest.  For just as Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his ruling social democrats (SDSM) pushes hard for the renaming referendum to take place in the Autumn, so one of two main opposition groups in the country, the VMRO-DPMNE party has pushed back. Its supporters see the deal as little more than a shameful capitulation to Athens, something Mr Zaev has condemned as backward looking.  \u0026ldquoInstead of boarding the train bound for the EU and Nato, he chose to stay on the dark side of history, Mr Zaev was recently quoted as saying of opposition leader Hristijan Mickovski\u0026rsquos reluctance to move forward with the renaming vote.  Despite the obvious acrimony between the two sides, many remain confident the name change ballot will still take place, opening the way for the new Republic of North Macedonia to become part of the Nato and EU fold.  Should things move in this direction then cue Mr Putin\u0026rsquos full efforts to thwart Macedonia\u0026rsquos Nato aspirations in much the same way he did in Montenegro. That much was already evident last month when according to authorities in Athens, Russia tried to pay off Greek clerics and officials to oppose the Macedonia-Greece deal.  The meddling prompted the Greek government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras this month to expel two Russian diplomats and deny entry to two others, while accusing the Kremlin of \u0026ldquoconstant disrespect for Greece.  It was an extraordinary move by the normally Russophilic Greek government that has been one of Russia\u0026rsquos best European friends.  Moscow in turn responded by cancelling a planned visit to Athens by foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and the two countries continue to trade angry statements.  In Macedonia itself, meanwhile, evidence suggests that Russia\u0026rsquos GRU military spy service is already using the sensitive mood in the country to stir up nationalist and anti-Western resentment, and so hindering Macedonia\u0026rsquos referendum route to Nato.  A few weeks ago Macedonia interior ministry documents seen by the local partner of the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reportedly revealed one key source of payments to opponents of the renaming referendum.  According to the group\u0026rsquos investigative journalists, Ivan Savvidi, a Russian billionaire living in Greece who was formerly a member of the Russian parliament and United Russia party, made payments worth at least \u0026curren300,000 to recently created radical nationalist organisations willing to foment unrest in the country. A similar Russian role was also uncovered in neighbouring Greece.  Intelligence service watchers say that what has been unfolding in Macedonia is almost a carbon copy of what happened in Montenegro, though in the latter, Russian intelligence operatives were also involved in plotting a violent coup that would have ended in the assassination of Montenegro\u0026rsquos pro-Western leader, Milo Djukanovic.  Much of course might still happen that could derail Macedonia\u0026rsquos renaming referendum and accession to Nato and EU membership.  If one thing is certain though, it\u0026rsquos that undaunted by his failure in Montenegro, Mr Putin is again pulling out the stops and sending forth the spooks and dirty tricks brigade to make things difficult in a country Russia insists as being within its sphere of influence.  It would come as no surprise too if all of a sudden, Mr Trump again suddenly discovers yet another small Balkan country on the map called Macedonia and joins the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chorus of mischief making."},{"url":null,"title":"may-to-get-extra-attempt-to-pitch-her-brexit-plan-directly-to-eu-leaders","story":"  Downing Street said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed that Britain\u0026rsquos departure from the EU would be on the agenda for the European Council being hosted by his country \u0026ndash which currently holds the EU presidency \u0026ndash on September 20.

It came as the head of a pan-European dairy co-operative warned that a no-deal Brexit would risk soaring prices and supply problems getting products to consumers.  Ash Amirahmardi, UK managing director of Arla Foods, spoke after ministers last week raised the spectre of foods and medicines being stockpiled as part of contingency planning in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place on customs.  Mr Amirahmardi told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme that 16% of UK dairy products are imported, and of those 98% were from Europe, saying: \u0026ldquoIf we have barriers at our ports then that is what is going to lead to increased prices and potentially supply issues.  He added that World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs \u0026ndash which would come into play if there was no Brexit deal \u0026ndash on dairy products are \u0026ldquopenal and that stockpiling produce is \u0026ldquonot something that is really practical for the dairy industry.  He said the average person in the UK consumes the equivalent of three pints of milk per day, adding: \u0026ldquoOne of the reasons they do is because of the nutritious benefits of it, but it is also accessible in terms of prices.  \u0026ldquoAny increase in the friction of movement of products will inevitably lead to higher costs and therefore one of our concerns is to make sure consumer prices are accessible post-Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"stunning-lightning-above-firth-of-forth-bridges-caught-on-camera","story":"  The spectacular image, captured by Sebastian Kuczynski on Thursday night, was taken as Scotland prepares to battle thunderstorms this weekend.\u0026nbsp  But the storm was not the only show laid on by the heavens as last night saw the longest \u0026ldquoblood moon eclipse of the 21st century.

The hot weather broke on Thursday night when lightning dominated the skies. Father-of-two Mr Kuczynski was planning on having a quiet night in with his wife Joanna, 38, until he heard the loud thunder and lightning.\u0026nbsp  The 43-year-old photographer, from South Queensferry, Edinburgh, rushed outside with his camera at 10:50pm to capture the spectacular lightning.

The former armed forces minister died aged 82 in March at his home in Biggar, Lanarkshire, after a long illness. His recently published will revealed he had an estate valued at \u0026pound6,106,816 at the time of his death.  This included his collection of Scottish coins, which were valued at \u0026pound1,785,000 and donated to the Hunterian museum at Glasgow University a year before he passed away.  In 2007 the oldest part of Mr Stewartby\u0026rsquos collection of Scottish coins, dating from the 12th century and worth \u0026pound500,000, was stolen from his Scottish home.  A \u0026pound50,000 reward was offered for their return and an appeal on Crimewatch five years later brought 40 calls from the public, but to no avail.  In 2016 his collection of English coins, many of them Anglo-Saxon, were auctioned off over five separate sales for a total of \u0026pound500,000.  Lord Stewartby\u0026rsquos fascination with coins was sparked when, as a child in wartime Barnet, he spotted a copper coin in a jar in a grocer\u0026rsquos shop with two heads on it. After meticulous research he discovered it dated from the reign of William and Mary.  As a schoolboy he learned that no complete book on the coinage of Scotland had been published since 1887, so wrote his own, Scottish Coinage, which was published\u0026nbspin 1955.\u0026nbsp  His will revealed that his wealth included his \u0026pound430,000 home and a stocks and shares portfolio worth more than \u0026pound3 million.  The peer instructed that his entire estate should be passed to his wife Deborah, although the coins will remain at Glasgow University.  After handing over his collection in March last year, Lord Stewartby said: \u0026ldquoThe new coin cabinet is a fitting home for it, where scholars and numismatists from all over the world may study the collection.  The collection contains some 6,000 coins from the reign of Alexander III in 1280 until the Act of Union of 1707, silver pennies of Robert The Bruce, gold lions of James I and II, and portrait groats of James III.

The council says here is increasing pressure on water supplies and forecast rain is not expected to replenish supplies sufficiently.                                                    Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Saturday 28 Jul 2018 11:50 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

They are expected to carry out an initial assessment this Saturday July 21.According to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), salvors have already begun deploying equipment to the incident site.  An outline salvage plan is due to be prepared for discussion between key stakeholders and the Acting Secretary of State’s Representative (SOSrep) Hugh Shaw for approval.  A Salvage Control Unit (SCU) will then be established near the incident.\u0026#8220This incident has now become a salvage operation in order to refloat the vessel,\u0026#8221 explained Mr Shaw in a statement this morning.\u0026#8220The Pentland Firth is well-known for the strength of its tides, which are among the fastest in the world, so I’m pleased that the owner’s representative and insurers have appointed experienced salvors without delay.\u0026#8220I am in dialogue with a number of  key stakeholders and once we have established and agreed the salvage plan, I will provide a further update on the way forward.\u0026#8221Mr Shaw has also established a Temporary Exclusion Zone of 500m around the incident site to ensure that there is no risk to the safety of persons engaged on the salvage operations and for other shipping traffic transiting or working in the area.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775236.1532720587!/image/image.jpg","title":"st andrews university voted top for student experience","story":"        The University of St Andrews has scooped first place in the UK for student academic experience, according to the results of the latest National Student Survey 2018.                The National Student Survey (NSS) named the university the UK’s top mainstream university – the tenth time in the past 12 years it has topped the league table.            The University of Dundee  once again achieved a top 10 UK place, and also ranked second in Scotland, followed by the University of Glasgow.            The census of nearly half a million students, the NSS is undertaken independently by Ipsos MORI.A total of 94 per cent of St Andrews final year students  gave the university top marks for the quality of the learning and teaching experience. The survey reflects student responses to questions  on academic support, learning resources, teaching, management, assessment, personal development and satisfaction. Professor Sally Mapstone, St Andrews principal, said: “This is a terrific result and a tribute to the commitment of academic and professional staff across the University of St Andrews who provide an outstanding environment and experience for our students. “St Andrews students recognise the exceptional quality of learning and teaching, facilities, and support at our University.             “We work in partnership with our students to ensure we continue to excel in this regard, and we take nothing for granted. These results demonstrate that those students joining our academic family in 2018 have made the right choice in calling St Andrews home.“Scottish universities are setting excellent standards in UK education, and we are proud to lead in the NSS, and to demonstrate our deep-rooted commitment to academic excellence and the student experience.”Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, representing Scotland’s 19 higher education institutions, said the results gave Scotland a “very good report card” but that the reasons for a small drop in satisfaction in some areas would be examined.“Today’s survey is another way of giving students a voice on their experience at university and it’s a survey that universities pay close attention to.            “83 per cent of students in Scotland are satisfied with the quality of their course, 89 per cent think staff are good at explaining things and 85 per cent think the course is intellectually stimulating. “That’s a very strong report card for our universities but we’ll obviously want to try to understand what sits behind the minor, 1 per cent drop in overall satisfaction amongst full-time students and a three per cent drop amongst part-time.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.

There is nothing better than a cracking fairytale when everything works out in the end with the main characters dancing into the sunset. Having overcome obstacles, barriers and nasty people, our wanderers sail away in a dream world of happiness and bliss. It warms our cockles and makes us feel all gooey inside. From Disney’s Cinderella to Tarzan to Shrek, good will win through and love will save the day.            And as always the baddie or villain gets his or her comeuppance and is cast aside. The villain learns his or her lesson and either falls off a cliff or eats lots of humble pie. But in the Brexit fairytale, the villain keeps winning and it’s spoiling the ending for me...            For many of you, Boris Johnson was a joke and a joker. He was happy to hang from a zip wire in London, ensuring all the press put his picture front of stage in the next day’s editions. He just loved the fact that his hair was literally all over the place and in need of some care and attention. It was and is messy and disheveled – all the time, making him look a bit clumsy and cute. He basked in the knowledge that the Tory-leaning broadsheet, The , would hire him at the drop of a hat to write his column, giving him that elevated platform he needed to point the finger at others. But, in this fairytale, Brexit Boris just will not leave us all alone to get on with the film. He keeps calling a halt to production. No, this baddie will not learn his lesson.I was one of those gullible idiots who swallowed the Brexit Bus slogans – hook, line and sinker. Hundreds of millions of pounds would come back to the UK each week and our NHS would swallow it up to keep this stalwart of British society prospering. READ MORE: |UK to stockpile food in event of no-deal BrexitAlong with Nigel Farage, Boris was front and centre in the Brexit campaign. It appeared these two characters were key to the plotline. They were partners in crime, but likeable rogues who were happy to swill a pint at the local village pub or get involved in some crazy prank. Were they the goodies or the baddies though? Then the unthinkable happened and we all woke up to the next instalment in our fairytale. These two had pulled it off.              Farage then did a runner. He has carved out a tidy media career with LBC in London. It is estimated that his media earnings are topping £700,000 a year. Well done Nigel. And who knows, Her Majesty may even honour him with that knighthood. It’ll be “Arise Sir Nigel”, as he distances himself from the nightmare he has helped create. But, this character is only now reduced to a sub-plot in our fairytale. The main protagonist and staring role goes to Boris. And I’m now convinced this baddie may be unstoppable.  No doubt the Tory grandees wanted him in power to give him a flavour of what it was like working with others. So, Mrs May was told to give him a seat at the table. The office of Foreign Secretary beckoned and he was completely unimpressive. Why? Because in this fairytale, he was plotting for more. He wants it all. He wants a shot at the title.My question to the screenwriters of our fairytale is this: Is the baddie not supposed to die or get trampled by rampaging wildebeest? Surely, you are not going to let the villain win the day?  No sooner had Johnson resigned, in what can only be described as a staged media directors cut, than he starts writing for the . The first thing he does is have a go at Sadiq Khan on London’s rising knife crime and violence. Now, let me see. How convenient is that Boris? A playing field you are comfortable in and very newsworthy to boot.            READ MORE: Two thirds of young Scots believe Brexit will be ‘bad’But, if we can just get back to the main plot. The one you, Boris, created and we are all suffering from as a result – Brexit. You cannot just whitewash yourself out of this one, hoping that some other patsy will pop up and take the blame. No, you wanted it, you sold it and now you need to run with it! We want a happy ending, Boris, and only you have the answer. After all, you had the answers 18 months ago...Does it feel like I’m being a bit accusatorial? Am I being too harsh on this Boris character? Are there other baddies in the background pulling his strings and writing the ending of our fairytale?This is our reality today as we prepare for a no-deal Brexit, WTO rules and a whole raft of sub-plots that we have not even considered. And we Scots are powerless to intervene in any way. The First Minister has tried. To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon must be sick to her back teeth of this baddie, wondering how she can have him written out of each scene. But, like Dr Legg in Eastenders, he keeps coming back.I’m afraid folks, there is no happy ending to our fairytale. Boris will make sure of that. Just as the world is burning, this baddie wants the hot seat, so he can rule and fulfil his potential and and make Boris 2, Boris 3: This Time it’s Personal, etc. It’s his movie and sequels and we are all bit-parts.              I wonder if he wakes up in the morning and sings that Lion King song, ‘I just can’t wait to be king!!’ The only problem with all of this is our fairytale has been turned upside down. Maybe it’s time we all left in search of Narnia. I hear the weather is a lot cooler there."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless.

My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f.jpg","title":"65204  ","story":"    \nA TEMPLEPATRICK horse and her locally-based rider have won the \u0026#8364300,000 Global Champions Tour Grand Prix in Paris.\nEgyptian rider Sameh El Dahan has been based with the Joanne Sloan-Allen Sycamore Stables\u0026#160 team in Templepatrick for the past eight years and shot to victory with Suma\u0027s Zorro.\nHaving won the five-star Grand Prix in Calgary last year and the La Coruna Spain Grand Prix earlier this year, the pair beat top young Irish rider Bertram Allen by half a second.\nJumping on the spectacular stage of the Champs de Mars, next to the Eiffel Tower, El Dahan\u0027s victory allowed him to qualify for the LGCT Super Grand Prix in Prague this December.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65205  ","story":"                \nAN Antrim nurse has made it into the record books at the World Powerlifting Championships in Canada.\nIn what she has called \u0027the most surreal experience of my life\u0027, Chlo�-Jade McDonald competed on the global stage alongside her idols, going last and finishing with 130 squat, 70 bench and a 177.5kg deadlift to secure national standard and three Irish records.\nShe finished third overall in the deadlift, scooping a bronze medal.\nCJ\u0026#160 is the current -57kg National champion and holds a number of Irish records including a phenomenal 163kg deadlift record. \nHer rise in the sport has been nothing short of meteoric, as she continues to juggle her intensive training schedule with a career as a psychiatric nurse as well as her duties as Randalstown Hockey Club\u0027s First XI captain.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren -

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a new fellowship of the rings is born","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nUNTIL\n three months ago, local environmental champion Aidan Crean had never seen a barn owl – which is why he looks so ecstatic this week in this photograph.\n\nAidan is holding a baby owl in what was the culmination of a project that is breathing new life into the fortunes of this spectacular and incredibly rare bird. \n\nA pair of barn owls – scréachóg reilige in Irish, meaning screecher of the graveyard – were found to be nesting in a derelict cottage on the shores of Lough Neagh, and – watched round the clock by another great West Belfast nature lover known to bloggers as Antrim Lens – the parents produced a record haul of five chicks. And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27. A limited number of tickets are still available priced at £8.\nFor more details on Paddy and his upcoming gigs follow www.facebook/paddyraff\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paisley-tears.png","title":"mp ian paisley suspended for","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nDUP\n MP Ian Paisley has been suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days – his party immediately also suspended him for an unspecified period pending its own investigation.\nThe North Antrim MP’s punishment follows his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, following which he wrote to the then Prime Minister supporting the country in its bid to block a UN investigation of its human rights record.\nThe Seaker of the House of Commons described it as “a regrettable state of affairs”. A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
